Mothers of Invention is a podcast hosted by former President of Ireland Mary Robinson, comedian Maeve Higgins and series producer Thimali Kodikara. It is produced by Doc Society. The podcast debuted on 23 July 2018 and has so far run for three seasons. The podcast focuses on the intersection between climate change and feminism, exploring the idea that climate change is a man-made problem with a feminist solution.
