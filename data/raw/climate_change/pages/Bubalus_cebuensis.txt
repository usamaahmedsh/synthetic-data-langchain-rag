The Cebu tamaraw (Bubalus cebuensis) is a fossil dwarf buffalo discovered in the Philippines, and first described in 2006.


== Anatomy and morphology ==
The most distinctive feature of B. cebuensis was its small size. Large contemporary domestic water buffalo stand 2 m (roughly 6 ft) at the shoulder and can weigh up to   1 tonne (around 2,000 lb), B. cebuensis would have stood only 75 cm (2 ft, 6 in) and weighed about 150 to 160 kg (330 to 350  lb), smaller than another dwarf species B. mindorensis.
The fossil specimen is likely Pleistocene or Holocene in age.


== Evolutionary history ==
The fossil was discovered in a horizontal tunnel in soft karst around 50 m elevation in K-Hill near Balamban, Cebu Island, the Philippines, by mining engineer Michael Armas. The fossil was donated to America's Field Museum, where it stayed unanalyzed for almost 50 years.
