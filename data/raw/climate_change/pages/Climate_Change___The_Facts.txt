The film won general praise from critics for highlighting the dangers that could be presented by not doing enough to tackle climate change. The Guardian called it a "rousing call to arms", while The Telegraph described the title as "robust" and praised the use of Attenborough as presenter: "At a time when public debate seems to be getting ever more hysterical, it's good to be presented with something you can trust. And we all trust Attenborough."
