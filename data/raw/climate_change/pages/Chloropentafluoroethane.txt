Chloropentafluoroethane is a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) once used as a refrigerant and also known as R-115 and CFC-115.  Its production and consumption has been banned since 1 January 1996 under the Montreal Protocol because of its high ozone depletion potential and very long lifetime when released into the environment. CFC-115 is also a potent greenhouse gas.

The atmospheric abundance of CFC-115 rose from 8.4 parts per trillion (ppt) in year 2010 to 8.7 ppt in 2020 based on analysis of air samples gathered from sites around the world.
