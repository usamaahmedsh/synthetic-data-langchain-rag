The United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation is a standing committee of the United States Senate. Besides having broad jurisdiction over all matters concerning interstate commerce, science and technology policy, and transportation, the Senate Commerce Committee is one of the largest of the Senate's standing committees, with 28 members in the 117th Congress. The Commerce Committee has six subcommittees. It is chaired by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) with Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) as ranking member. The majority office is housed in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and the minority office is located in the Hart Senate Office Building.


== History ==
The committee has its roots in the Committee on Commerce and Manufacturers, which served as a standing committee in the early-1800s. This committee was split in two in the 1820s and remained in this configuration until the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. Under the LRA, the number of standing committees was dramatically decreased to increase congressional efficiency and increase institutional strength. As a result, the Committee on Commerce, the Committee on Manufactures, the Committee on Interstate Commerce, and the Committee on Interoceanic Canals were combined into the United States Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. In 1977, as a part of widespread committee reorganization, the committee was renamed the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and given additional oversight jurisdiction over nonmilitary aeronautical and space sciences, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
The original progenitors of this committee were:

United States Senate Committee on Commerce and Manufactures (1816–1825)
United States Senate Committee on Commerce (1825–1946, 1961–1977)
United States Senate Committee on Manufactures (1825–1855, 1864–1946)
United States Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce (1885–1946)
United States Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals (1899–1946)
United States Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce (1946–1961)
United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences (1958–1977)
