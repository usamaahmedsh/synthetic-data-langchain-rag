The Turkish Emissions Trading System is the carbon emission trading system of Turkey, which is supposed to start in Q3 2026, with a pilot phase including industries such as cement. Exporters will have to pay the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism from 1 January 2026 until the Turkish ETS starts. The implementation phase is due to run from  2027 to 2034. As of 2025 a law has been passed but allowances not yet decided, and it has not yet clear whether the country will join the Cooperative Mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. In 2025 experts said that the lack of clarity on allowances (caps) was hindering future decarbonization.
