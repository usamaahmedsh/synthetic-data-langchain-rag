CO2M-B, also known as Sentinel-7B is a future European Earth observation satellite within the EU's Copernicus programme, expected to launch in 2028. Its goal is to provide global measurements of anthropogenic emissions of CO2, CH4, and NO2 to support fulfilling the Paris Agreement. Like its sister spacecraft CO2M-A (Sentinel-7A), it will be equipped with an infrared spectrometer, a multi-angle polarimeter, and a cloud imager.
