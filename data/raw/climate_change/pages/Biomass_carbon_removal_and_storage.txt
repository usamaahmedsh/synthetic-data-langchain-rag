Biomass carbon removal and storage (frequently abbreviated as BiCRS) is a family of technologies for Carbon dioxide removal, which collect biomass (such as agricultural waste or biproducts of biomass energy systems) and sequesters that carbon through a permanent or semi-permanent method of storage. The family of technologies is often compared with direct air capture. Unlike direct air capture that use human engineered technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (which is expensive and energy intensive), BiCRS technologies rely on photosynthesis of plants and then engineering solutions for taking the carbon-rich residue of that plant life and sequestering it.
BiCRS technologies introduce a number of challenges for carbon dioxide removal, including uncertainty about measuring sequestration of buried biomass, andcomplexity in sourcing biomass (it introduces additional demand for agricultural land and organic bioproducts). Researchers and policy think tanks like World Resources Institute recommend policy that put limits on which kind of biomass can be used for these process.
The family of technologies is a major part of the Frontier Climate advanced commitment purchase portfolio, including companies like Charm Industrial and Vaulted Deep.
