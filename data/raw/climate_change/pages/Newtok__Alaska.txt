Newtok (Central Yupik: Niugtaq) is a small village on the Ningliq River in the Bethel Census Area, Alaska, United States. The population is zero as of late 2024, down from 321 in 2000, and the village has been abandoned. Climate change and river erosion forced the primarily Central Yup'ik Alaska Native village to consider relocation. Residents moved to the new village of Mertarvik.

Newtok first appeared on the 1950 U.S. Census as "Keyaluvik", an unincorporated native village. This was also the name of the earlier settlement just to the west, which became known as "Old Keyaluvik." In 1960, the name was changed to Newtok. Newtok formally incorporated in 1976, but disincorporated in 1997. It was then made a census-designated place (CDP), effective with the 2000 census.

As of the census of 2000, there were 321 people, 63 households, and 51 families residing in the CDP.  The population density was 313.1 inhabitants per square mile (120.9/km2).

== Environmental issues ==

In 2007, The New York Times reported that erosion made Newtok an island between the widening Ningliq River and a slough to the north, because Alaskan permafrost is melting due to climate change. Coastal storms and thawing permafrost have worn away the land upon which Newtok was built. According to The New York Times article, because the village is below sea-level and sinking, the town could be washed away within a decade.
Erosion of the tundra by the river has destroyed much of the area of the village, including the barge dock. The United States Army Corps of Engineers' March 2009 report estimates the highest point in the town, the high school, will be under water by the year 2017.
The town was featured in the 2009 History Channel's TV show, Tougher in Alaska, in the episode called "Dangerous Earth."
In 2015, Newtok was one of the two towns featured in the Al Jazeera English Fault Lines documentary, When the Water Took the Land.
By 2019, the first residents moved to a new town, Mertarvik.
In 2022, Patagonia released a feature-length documentary on Newtok.


== Education ==
Lower Kuskokwim School District operates the Ayaprun School, K-12. As of 2018 the school has 128 students, 12 teachers, and 27 other employees. Its continuation is the Mertarvik Pioneer School.


== Relocation ==

Land was acquired for a new townsite called Mertarvik on nearby Nelson Island about 9 miles (14 km) away, and $1 million in government funding was obtained to build a dock for delivering building supplies.
As of 2016, although the town's roughly 400 residents voted in 2003 to relocate to higher ground nine miles away, progress has been slow.
On December 24, 2016, the village made a disaster declaration request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for disaster assistance due to "flooding, persistent erosion, and permafrost degradation starting on January 1, 2006 and continuing."  The request would "include relocation of the Yupik Tribe (population of ~350 people)."
During the summer of 2018, a 6,000 square-foot community center was built, as were 8 houses.  Plans for 2019 include interior work in the community center so it can be used as a school, a generator building, and 13 more houses.  Construction of roads, pipes, and a water treatment plant is planned.  The goal is to complete relocation by 2023.
In September 2022, Typhoon Merbok caused damage to fuel barrels and moved the ocean shoreline closer to the edge of the town.
