The Indian Youth Climate Network (IYCN) is a youth organization in India that aims to raise the voice of Indian youth on the global platform, as South Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions affected by climate change and environmental issues. Further, IYCN is motivated by global need in the Indian context to adopt mitigation and adaptation policy measure to combat climate change. It is part of the International Youth Climate Movement, which has the same acronym of IYCM.
IYCN members work to generate consensus on what role India should play in the global debate of climate change, and how it should address its domestic issues.
Started in 2008, IYCN was registered as an NGO in 2009. Today, IYCN has offices in six locations with chapters in the Indian states and has an outreach to thousands of youth in colleges, schools, corporations and institutions in India.
IYCN has "informed youth" as its leaders and program members who:

Follow environmental and climate change policies and make recommendations at state, national and international platforms.
Run campaigns aimed at public awareness on climate change impact & causes. In this process, the chapters mobilise and informing thousands of Indian citizens.
Implement projects such as composting and community waste management, rural energy projects, lake clean-ups, and herbal and medicine gardens.
IYCN works at three levels:

As a network of individuals enabling people to come together and work at a grassroots level, to form friendships and support each other.
As a network of partner and supporter groups who bring together their strengths and passion for environment and sustainable development.
As an organisation that runs its own programs/projects as well as participates in and supports programs/campaigns of other organisations.


== Background and history ==
There was a need for more representation of Indian youth in the 2007 United Nations Climate Change conference (UNFCCC) conference of the parties (COP) international climate negotiations that had been held in Bali, Indonesia.
The Indian Youth Climate Network was created in the following year, 2008. The organization started with attending a climate change & public survey of Delhi's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor hosted by India's Centre for Science and Environment CSE. IYCN sent its first ever youth delegation of 8 members to COP14 in Poznan, Poland (2008). Since then, more than 80 members of IYCN have participated and contributed in key policy deliberations at COPs.

Agents of Change
The program aims to send a delegation of Indian Young people which will strive to engage government delegations from around the world in policy, help build consensus amongst civil society groups and assist in the construction of a global youth climate network.
Climate Leadership Program
The program aims to produce a group of youth who would lead grassroots climate groups in their communities; leaders who will organize and mobilize people; and leaders who will spread the message about the urgency of climate change. The Leadership Training for Campus Climate Changers is a full day interactive session on climate change, beginning with basic climate science and solutions and moving quickly into brainstorming on campus solutions, creating action plans for implementation, and media training to communicate successes.
Rural Energy Project
The aim is to create a clean technology project in rural India that will reduce greenhouse gases, and work towards reducing the heating of the planet.
