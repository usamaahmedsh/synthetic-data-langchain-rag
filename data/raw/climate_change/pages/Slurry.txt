A slurry is a mixture of denser solids suspended in liquid, usually water. The most common use of slurry is as a means of transporting solids or separating minerals, the liquid being a carrier that is pumped on a device such as a centrifugal pump. The size of solid particles may vary from 1 micrometre up to hundreds of millimetres.
The particles may settle below a certain transport velocity and the mixture can behave like a Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluid. Depending on the mixture, the slurry may be abrasive and/or corrosive.


== Examples ==
Examples of slurries include:

Cement slurry, a mixture of cement, water, and assorted dry and liquid additives used in the petroleum and other industries
Soil/cement slurry, also called Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM), flowable fill, controlled density fill, flowable mortar, plastic soil-cement, K-Krete, and other names
A mixture of thickening agent, oxidizers, and water used to form a gel explosive
A mixture of pyroclastic material, rocky debris, and water produced in a volcanic eruption and known as a lahar
A mixture of bentonite and water used to make slurry walls
Coal slurry, a mixture of coal waste and water, or crushed coal and water
Slip, a mixture of clay and water used for joining, glazing and decoration of ceramics and pottery.
Slurry oil, the highest boiling fraction distilled from the effluent of an FCC unit in an oil refinery. It contains a large amount of catalyst, in form of sediments hence the denomination of slurry.
A mixture of wood pulp and water used to make paper
Manure slurry, a mixture of animal waste, organic matter, and sometimes water often known simply as "slurry" in agricultural use, used as fertilizer after aging in a slurry pit
Meat slurry, a mixture of finely ground meat and water, centrifugally dewatered and used as a food ingredient.
An abrasive substance used in chemical-mechanical polishing
Slurry ice, a mixture of ice crystals, freezing point depressant, and water
A mixture of raw materials and water involved in the rawmill manufacture of Portland cement
A bolus of chewed food mixed with saliva
A mixture of epoxy glue and glass microspheres used as a filler compound around core materials in sandwich-structured composite airframes.

In aqueous slurries, as is common in mineral processing, the specific gravity of the species is typically used, and since specific gravity of water is taken to be 1, this relation is typically written:
