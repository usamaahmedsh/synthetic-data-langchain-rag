Thailand is a sovereign state located in the center of Mainland Southeast Asia. The country extends from the southeastern foothills of the Himalayas to the Mekong river, further south to the Gulf of Thailand, and roughly to the middle of the Malay Peninsula and the Andaman Sea of the Indian Ocean. It has a total size of 513,120 km2 (198,120 sq mi) which is the 50th largest in the world. The land area lies between latitudes 5° 37' South and 20° 27' North, and between the longitude 97° 22' West and 105° 37' East.
Thailand shares a 4,863 km (3,022 mi) long international land boundary with Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia. The nation's axial position influenced many aspects of Thailand's society and culture. Southern Thailand is the only land route from mainland Asia to Malaysia and Singapore. It has an exclusive economic zone of 305,778 km2 (118,062 sq mi).


== Composition and geography ==


=== Location ===
A fertile floodplain and tropical monsoon climate, ideally suited to wet-rice (tham na) cultivation, attracted settlers to this central area in preference to the marginal uplands and the highlands of the northern region or the Khorat Plateau to the northeast.
By the 11th century AD, a number of loosely connected rice-growing and trading states flourished in the upper Chao Phraya Valley. They broke free from domination of the Khmer Empire, but from the middle of the 14th century gradually came under the control of the Ayutthaya Kingdom at the southern extremity of the floodplain.
Successive capitals, built at various points along the river, became centers of great Thai kingdoms based on rice cultivation and international commerce. Unlike the neighboring Khmer and Burmese, the Thai continued to look outward across the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea toward foreign ports of trade.
European colonisation of Southeast Asia brought a new phase of Southeast Asian commerce in the late-1800s. Thailand (then called Siam) was able to maintain its independence as a buffer zone between British-controlled Burma to the west, British Malaya to the south, and French Indochina to the east. However, Thailand lost over 50% of its former territory to the expanding claims of French Indochina until 1907. Its central location made the Kingdom of Thailand's position a regional hub that has greatly influenced its society, culture and history. Southern Thailand has a long, narrow shape. It is the only land connection to Malaysia and Singapore.


=== Mountains ===

The mountain ranges that run parallel from north to south across Mainland Southeast Asia are one of Thailand's most distinctive geographical features. The country's highest peak is Doi Inthanon, with an elevation of 2,565 meters. Major mountain ranges include the Thanon Thong Chai Range, the Daen Lao Range on Thailand's northern edge, and the Tenasserim Hills on the border with Myanmar. The average elevation decreases southward. There are no volcanoes. There are 10 mountains over 2,000 m (6,600 ft). 148 mountains exceed 1,000 m (3,300 ft).
Northern Thailand's mountainous regions like Chiang Mai and Doi Inthanon have chilly air and misty mornings. However, at high altitudes it does not get colder than 5 °C to 10 °C due to the tropical climate. There is no snow and frost is rare in the coldest months. In 1955, snow-like frost was reported in Doi Inthanon.
The 10 tallest mountains in Thailand are all located in Northern Thailand. The highest peaks are:


=== Shape ===

The geographic shape of Thailand resembles an elephant's head with a long trunk. There are 2 big ears, the Bay of Bangkok is a mouth and Southern Thailand is a long trunk that reaches down the Malay Peninsula. The westside is the front of the head. The elephant holds deep cultural significance and it's a national symbol of Thailand. The elephant also symbolizes Thailand’s natural heritage and fills a vital role in the ecosystems of the region. It's also considered a "golden axe". The broad northern regions are the double-bitted part of the axe like a labrys. The narrow southern “tail” is the handle. The shape changed during the various kingdoms such as Sukhothai, Ayutthaya, and Rattanakosin.


=== Plains ===
Thailand has large plains, valleys and basins.


=== Forests ===
The forest cover rate was 63% in the 1940s, but declined to 53.3% in the 1960s and 26.6% in 1991. It had been declining due to timber exports, urbanization, and development. Since the late 1980s, the decline has been halted since protective measures such as banning logging of natural forests were implemented. As of 2020, the Royal Forest Department has classified the country's forests as 31.6% and 38.9% according to the FAO, remaining stable.
The Royal Forest Department classifies the country's forests into six categories: mangrove/coastal forest, evergreen forest, evergreen forest, mixed deciduous forest, deciduous dipterocarp forest, and savanna. Exotic plantations such as eucalyptus and rubber are classified as agricultural land. Of these, mangrove forests and coastal forests are more prevalent in the south and east, mixed deciduous forests in the north, and deciduous dipterocarp forests and savannas in the northeast.


=== Rivers ===

The main rivers are the Chao Phraya River and the Mekong, as well as the Salween River, Mae Klong, Mun River, Chi River, Tha Chin River, and Bang Pakong River. Southern Thailand has short and steep rivers due to the narrow peninsula. The Mekong is partially a natural border between Thailand and Laos for 920 km. It flows from the Golden Triangle in Northern Thailand to Khong Chiam district in Northeastern Thailand.
These are the 10 longest rivers of Thailand:


=== Lakes ===
There are around 8000 natural lakes and swamps. This includes a few large lakes and thousands of small lakes. Songkhla lake is the largest natural lake at 1,040 km2 (400 sq mi).
These are the 9 largest lakes of Thailand: 


=== Waterfalls ===
There are over 50 waterfalls in Thailand. These are the top 10 tallest.


=== Islands ===

There are approximately 1,430 islands. They are relatively small-sized islands and uninhabited islets. Many islands are protected areas in national parks or wildlife sanctuaries. Most islands are near the coasts of Southern Thailand and Eastern Thailand. The largest island is Phuket 543 km2 (210 sq mi) in the Andaman Sea.
These are the 10 largest islands of Thailand: 


== Geology ==
Present-day Thailand is theorized to have formed during the Triassic period when two continental fragments: Shan-Thai and Cimmeria formed during the breakup of Gondwana. Shan-Thai and Cimmeria collided and merged, eventually moving northward and connecting with Laurasia. Geologically, Thailand is divided into the Western Zone, which belongs to the Shan-Thai terrane; the Northeastern Zone, which belongs to the Indochina Block; and the Central Zone, which is located between the Western and Northeastern Zones.
The northeastern part of Thailand is a relatively stable plateau, with only the Mesozoic, Jurassic and Cretaceous sandstone and shale being uplifted by Tertiary tectonic activity.[30] Most of the rest of the country exhibits a complex geological structure, consisting primarily of Paleozoic limestone and other sedimentary rocks, and Precambrian metamorphic rocks. Late Mesozoic granite is found in the Western Zone, while Paleozoic and Mesozoic neutral or acidic volcanic rocks are abundant in the Central Zone.
Although seismic activity is not particularly high, there are 13 known active faults, mainly in the northwest and central-southwest, and in 2014 the northern part of the country experienced one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded (the 2014 Mae Lao earthquake), measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale.

== Gulf of Thailand ==

The Gulf of Thailand was historically called the Gulf of Siam until the country was renamed to Thailand in 1939. It is geographically defined by Thailand which encloses the body of water for circa 3/4th of the coastline.


=== Bays ===
The Thai sea territory of the gulf has 5 noteworthy bays:


== Topography and drainage ==

The most conspicuous features of Thailand's terrain are high mountains, a central plain, and an upland plateau. Mountains cover much of northern Thailand and extend along the Myanmar border down through the Kra Isthmus and the Malay Peninsula. The central plain is a lowland area drained by the Chao Phraya River and its tributaries, the country's principal river system, which feeds into the delta at the head of the Bay of Bangkok. The Chao Phraya system drains about one-third of the nation's territory. In the northeastern part of the country the Khorat Plateau, a region of gently rolling low hills and shallow lakes, drains into the Mekong River via the Mun River. The Mekong system empties into the South China Sea and includes a series of canals and dams.
Together, the Chao Phraya and Mekong systems sustain Thailand's agricultural economy by supporting wet-rice cultivation and providing waterways for the transport of goods and people. In contrast, the distinguishing natural features of peninsular Thailand are long coastlines, offshore islands, and mangrove swamps. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 559 km2 (216 sq mi) of tidal flats in Thailand, making it the 45th ranked country in terms of tidal flat extent.

== Regions & provinces ==

Thailand is a unitary state; the administrative services of the executive branch are divided into three levels by the Law on the Organization of National Government, BE 2534 (1991): central, provincial and local. Thailand's regions are divided into a total of 76 provinces (จังหวัด , changwat) plus Bangkok, which is a special administrative area. These are first-level administrative divisions.
The National Research Council divides Thailand into six geographical regions, based on natural features including landforms and drainage, as well as human cultural patterns. They are:

North
Northeast
Central
East
West
South
Although Bangkok geographically is part of the central plain, as the capital and largest city this metropolitan area may be considered in other respects a separate region.
Each of the six geographical regions differs from the others in population, basic resources, natural features, and level of social and economic development. The diversity of the regions is in fact the most pronounced attribute of Thailand's physical setting.


== Climate ==

Thailand's climate is influenced by seasonal monsoon winds (the southwest and northeast monsoons).
Most of Thailand has a "tropical wet and dry or savanna climate" type (Köppen's Tropical savanna climate). The majority of the south as well as the extreme east have a tropical monsoon climate. Parts of the south also have a tropical rainforest climate.


=== Seasons ===
Thailand has three seasons: summer, rainy, and winter.

Due to their inland location and latitude, the north, northeast, central, and eastern parts of Thailand experience a long period of warm weather. During the hottest time of the year (March to May), temperatures usually reach up to 30 °C (86 °F) or more, with the exception of coastal areas where sea breezes moderate afternoon temperatures. In some areas (particularly the north and northeast) close to or below 0 °C (32 °F). Southern Thailand has mild weather year-round, with less diurnal and seasonal variations in temperatures, due to maritime influences.
Most of the country receives a mean annual rainfall of 1,200 to 1,600 mm (47 to 63 in). However, certain areas on the windward sides of mountains such as Ranong Province on the west coast of southern Thailand and eastern parts of Trat Province receive more than 4,500 mm (180 in) of rainfall per year. The driest areas are the leeward sides of the central valleys and the northernmost portion of south Thailand, where mean annual rainfall is less than 1,200 mm (47 in).
Most of Thailand (north, northeast, central, and east) has dry weather during the northeast monsoon and abundant rainfall during the southwest monsoon. In the southern parts of Thailand, abundant rainfall occurs in both the northeast and southwest monsoon seasons, with a peak in September for the western coast and a peak in November–January on the eastern coast.


=== Northern vs southern climate ===
The tropical savanna climate in Northern Thailand vs the tropical monsoon climate in Southern Thailand has notable differences. The average temperature in Phuket (Southern Thailand) is warmer than Chiang Mai (Northern Thailand) year-round. However, Phuket has more rainy days and rainfall per month than Chiang Mai.


=== Bangkok ===
The capital Bangkok has a tropical savanna climate (Aw) as per the Köppen climate classification. The Asian monsoon system influences the city's three seasons: summer (hot), rainy, and winter (cool). The winter is rarely below 23 °C (41 °F): circa 23.2 °C (73.8 °F) in December to 35.7 °C (96.3 °F) in April. The annual average temperature is 28.9 °C (84.0 °F).
The summer begins in mid-February and it's usually dry with occasional storms. The rainy season is caused by the southwest monsoon around mid-May. September is the wettest month with around 335.9 millimetres (13.22 in) rainfall. The cool northeast monsoon causes the winter season from mid-October till mid-February.

Bangkok's urban heat island causes a temperature increase of 2.5 °C (4.5 °F) during daytime and 8.0 °C (14 °F) at night. Bangkok metropolis' highest temperature was 41.0 °C (105.8 °F) on 7 May 2023. and the lowest 9.9 °C (49.8 °F) in January 1955.


== Natural resources ==


=== Land resources ===
Tin, rubber, natural gas, tungsten, tantalum, timber, lead, fish, gypsum, lignite, fluorite, arable land.


==== Land use ====
In 2022, circa 46% is agricultural land. 38.8% is forest. The remaining 15.2% is divided by residential, water (surface, rivers, waterways), roads and wilderness. The exact stats are unavailable.


==== Land ownership ====
Pattamawadee Pochanukul, a lecturer from the Faculty of Economics at Thammasat University, estimates that about 59% of all arable land in Thailand belongs to the state. As of 30 September 2015 the Treasury Department owned 176,467 plots of land, consisting of about 9.9 million rai (15,769.6 km2). The Ministry of Defence owns about 2.6 million rai (4,230 km2) or about 21.2% of total public land. Information from the Office of the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) shows that members of the house of representatives in 2013 owned a total of 35,786 rai of land (about 57.3 km2).


==== Irrigated land ====
Total: 64,150 km2 (24,770 sq mi) (2012)


=== Marine resources ===

Thailand has the world's 64th largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ), with an area of 305,778 km2 (118,062 sq mi). It claims an EEZ of 200 nmi (370.4 km; 230.2 mi) from its shores, which has long coastlines with the Andaman Sea and Strait of Malacca to the west and the Gulf of Thailand to the east, although all of its EEZ is limited by maritime boundaries with neighboring countries. Circa 3/4th of the coastline around the Gulf of Thailand is part of Thailand.


==== Inland fishery ====
Over 150 fish species have been identified in catches from inland waters. 20 of these are economically important. The most common fish is the carp (represented by Puntius gonionotus, Puntioplites proctosyzron, Cirrhinus jullieni, Osteocheilus hasselti, Labiobarbus lineatus, Morulius chrysophekadion etc). The favorite fish of Thai people are 2 species of Snakehead (fish) called Channa striata and Channa micropeltes. The main catfish species are Clarias batrachus, C. microcephalus, Pangasius sutchi, P. larnooudii, P. siamensis, Kryptopterus pogon and Ompok bimaculatus. Corcia siamensis is the only representative of the clupeidae family.


==== Total renewable water resources ====
Total: 438.61 billion cubic meters (2022 est.)


=== Energy ===
In 2014, 75% of Thailand's electricity production was fueled by natural gas. Coal-fired power plants produced an additional 20% of the electricity, with the remainder coming from biomass, hydropower, and biogas.
Thailand produces about a third of the oil it consumes. It is the second-largest oil importer in Southeast Asia. Thailand is a major producer of natural gas, with reserves of at least 3 trillion cubic meters. After Indonesia, it is the largest coal producer in Southeast Asia, but it needs to import more coal to meet domestic demand.


== Biota ==


=== Fauna ===
The biogeographic realm is part of the Indomalayan realm, spanning the Indochina and Sunda subrealms.[70] According to ONEP (2007), there are 302 recorded mammal species, 982 bird species, 350 reptile species, 137 amphibian species, and 2,820 fish species (720 freshwater fish species). The conservation status of 1,196 of these species was assessed in 2005, and 116 mammal species, 180 bird species, 32 reptile species, 5 amphibian species, and 215 fish species were listed as threatened. Circa 264 mammal species in Thailand are on the IUCN Red List.
The elephant is a representative animal, and white elephants are considered symbols of kingship, have been featured on the national flag, and are considered to be the incarnation of Buddha in Buddhism, which is practiced by the majority of the population. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were approximately 100,000 elephants in captivity, but as of 2023, the wild population had declined to approximately 2,250 and the captive population to approximately 2,400. The central government has taken measures to protect elephants, such as opening conservation facilities and dedicated hospitals. See also elephants in Thailand. Water buffalo and bulls were also used as working animals, but by the 1980s, due to the diversification of transportation methods, they were rarely used as working animals.


=== Flora ===
The phytochorion belongs to the Paleotropical kingdom. It is estimated that approximately 1,900 genus and 10,000 species of vascular plants inhabit the region, of which about 10% are considered endemic. Santisuk et al. (2006) lists a total of 1,407 species distributed in Thailand, including 921 species of dicotyledonous plants, 417 species of monocotyledonous plants, 42 species of ferns, and 27 species of gymnosperms.
Major tree species include those of the Dipterocarpaceae family and teak, as well as species from the Diospyros genus, Artocarpus genus, Lagerstroemia genus, and in mangrove forests, species from the Rhizophoraceae and Meliaceae families.


=== Notable species native to Thailand ===

These are notable flora and fauna that live in their natural habitats of Thailand.


== Environmental issues ==


=== Environmental concerns ===
Natural hazards: Land subsidence in Bangkok, resulting from the depletion of the water table; droughts (see also 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and 2011 Thai floods). Thailand is highly exposed to the effects of climate change such as the rising sea levels and extreme weather events.
Drought: Droughts are a persistent feature of Thailand's climate. Droughts appear to be worsening according to the Thai Meteorological Department. and drought hazard mapping.
Air pollution
Water pollution from organic and industry wastes
Deforestation
Soil erosion
Wildlife populations threatened by illegal hunting


=== Agriculture impact ===
The unpredictability of precipitation, temperature changes and many other harmful events will intensify in the future. This means that Thailand will have to face droughts in the middle of the rainy season, which will result in damage to young plants and flooding of rice fields. It is therefore imperative for Thailand to adapt as quickly as possible to these changes to protect its population on the one hand and, if it wishes, to maintain a monopoly on the export of rice and not suffer significant losses. Which would ultimately have a huge impact on the country's economy. Particularly with the fluctuation in the price of rice, due to uncertainties, which prevents farmers from increasing their income.


=== International environmental agreements ===
Party to: biodiversity, climate change, climate change-Kyoto Protocol, desertification, endangered species, hazardous wastes, marine life conservation, Ozone layer protection, tropical timber 83, tropical timber 94, wetlands
Signed, but not ratified: Law of the Sea


== Territorial disputes ==


=== History ===
Thailand shares boundaries with Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar. The territories of China and Vietnam do not border Thailand, but they are within around 100 km distance.
Many parts of Thailand's boundaries follow natural features, such as the Mekong river. Most borders were stabilized and demarcated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in accordance with treaties forced on Thailand and its neighbors by the British Empire and French Indochina. In some areas, however, exact boundaries, especially along Thailand's eastern borders with Laos and Cambodia, are still disputed.


=== Cambodia ===

Cambodia's disputes with Thailand after 1951 arose in part from ill-defined boundaries and changes in France's colonial fortunes. Recently, the most notable case has been a dispute over Preah Vihear submitted to the International Court of Justice, which ruled in favor of Cambodia in 1962. During the years that the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, was controlled by the Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot (1975 to 1979), the border disputes continued.


=== Laos ===

Demarcation is complete except for certain Mekong islets. The border is marked by the Mekong: at high water during the rainy season, the centre line of the current is the border, while during low water periods, all islands, mudbanks,  sandbanks, and rocks that are revealed belong to Laos.


=== Malaysia ===

In contrast to dealings with Cambodia, which attracted international attention, boundary disputes with Malaysia are usually handled more cooperatively. Continuing mineral exploration and fishing, however, are sources of potential conflict. One segment at the mouth of the Golok River remained in dispute with Malaysia as of 2023, along with a section of the continental shelf in the Gulf of Thailand.


=== Myanmar ===

Sovereignty over three Andaman Sea islands remains disputed. The standing agreement, negotiated in February 1982, left undetermined the status of Ginga Island (Ko Lam), Ko Kham, and Ko Ki Nok at the mouth of the Kraburi River (Pakchan River). Subsequent negotiations in 1985, 1989, and 1990 made no progress. The two parties have designated the islands as "no man's land". Ongoing tensions in the area resulted in minor clashes in 1998, 2003, and 2013.
