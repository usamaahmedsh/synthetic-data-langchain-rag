The minister of the environment, climate change and nature (French: ministre de l'environnement, du changement climatique et de la nature) is the minister of the Crown responsible for Environment and Climate Change Canada, Parks Canada and the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada.  The minister is a member of the King's Privy Council for Canada and the Canadian Cabinet.
Julie Dabrusin has been the minister since May 13, 2025. The minister is selected by the prime minister and appointed by the Crown. The role was introduced in 1971 as the minister of environment. Until 1979, the role was also responsible for fisheries. Environment Canada was rebranded to include climate change in its name in 2015, and the minister's title was renamed Minister of Environment and Climate Change. After re-absorbing responsibility for Parks Canada in 2025, the current title was adopted.
