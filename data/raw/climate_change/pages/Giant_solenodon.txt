The giant solenodon (Atopogale arredondoi) is an extinct species of soricomorph that occurred in western Cuba. A larger animal than the still-extant Cuban solenodon (Atopogale cubana), the species is believed to have been eradicated through habitat destruction and the introduction of predatory dogs to Cuba by pre-Columbian people.
