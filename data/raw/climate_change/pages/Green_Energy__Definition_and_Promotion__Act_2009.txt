The Green Energy (Definition and Promotion) Act 2009 (c 19) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Act is intended to reduce carbon emissions in England and Wales in order to reduce climate change, to increase the diversity and security of energy supplies, to reduce fuel poverty, and to contribute to meeting the EU 2020 renewable energy targets.


== Section 1 - Definition and promotion of green energy ==
Sections 1(2) and (3) define the expression "green energy" for the purposes of this Act, the definition given being:(a) the generation of electricity or heat from renewable or low-carbon sources by the use of any equipment, the capacity of which to generate electricity or heat does not exceed the capacity specified in subsection (3); and(b) energy efficiency measures. The relevant capacities were listed as 5 megawatts for electricity generation and 5 megawatts thermal for the generation of heat.

These sections make provision for the promotion of microgeneration and the development of a microgeneration strategy. The microgeneration strategy was published in March 2006.


== Section 5 - Interpretation ==
This section defines the words and expressions "dwellinghouse", "energy efficiency measure", "equipment", "fuel poverty", "the GPDO" and "renewable or low-carbon source" for the purposes of the Act.


== Section 6 - Short title, commencement and extent ==
Section 6(1) authorises the citation of the Act by a short title.
Section 6(2) provides that the Act came into force at the end of the period of two months that began on the day that it was passed. The word "months" means calendar months.
