== History ==

When the course was inaugurated on 6 September 2010, the first batch had their initial classes at College of Fisheries (CoF) Panangad, Ernakulam. After CoF was delinked from the KAU to Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies in 2010, the students were temporarily transferred to a building located at KAU's main campus in Vellanikara, alongside the NH-47, with GSLHV Prasad Rao as the first special officer. The students remained there till 2015, almost a five-year gap, during which the college grew to its full potential of five batches. The new college building was inaugurated by Oommen Chandy, then Chief Minister of Kerala on 28 September 2015.
In 2020, the name of the college changed to College of Climate Change and Environmental Science, and a new course was introduced named B.Sc.(Hons) Climate Change and Environmental Science.
