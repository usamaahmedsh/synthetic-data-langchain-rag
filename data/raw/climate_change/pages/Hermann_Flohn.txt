Flohn was member in numerous scientific societies such as the Bavarian Academy, the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Academy of Belgium.


== Life ==

Flohn was born in Frankfurt am Main, he studied geography, meteorology, geophysics, and geology at the universities of Frankfurt and Innsbruck. Having obtained his doctorate in 1934, he accepted a position at the newly established German Meteorological Service (Reichswetterdienst). From 1941 he was employed at the meteorological service of the Luftwaffe High Command.
In 1941 Flohn published the first German article concerning anthropogenic climate change. Having returned to the Deutscher Wetterdienst after the war, Flohn from 1950 helped develop the theory of atmospheric circulation. Flohn was one of the first and leading global climate change researchers. From 1961 he worked as a lecturer at the University of Bonn. In 1977 Flohn retired, he died in 1997 in Bonn, aged 85.
