This is a list of North American animals extinct in the Holocene that covers extinctions from the Holocene epoch, a geologic epoch that began about 11,650 years before present (about 9700 BCE) and continues to the present day. 
Recently extinct animals in the West Indies and Hawaii are in their own respective lists.
Many extinction dates are unknown due to a lack of relevant information.
