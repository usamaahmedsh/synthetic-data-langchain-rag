Megalotragus (from Greek mega (μέγα) 'great' and tragos (τράγος) 'goat') is a genus of very large African alcelaphines that lived during the Pliocene to early Holocene. Its skull resembled that of modern hartebeests, but it differed in having a larger body size and wildebeest-like proportions. Megalotragus includes some of the largest bovid species in the subfamily Alcelaphinae, reaching a shoulder height of 1.4 m (4.6 ft). The genus consists of three species of which Megalotragus priscus survived until the early Holocene 7.500 C14yBP.


== Description ==
With a distance between the tips of its horns of around 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in), Megalotragus is probably the largest alcelaphine bovid ever recorded, much bigger than the extant wildebeest. The skull of Megalotragus is similar to that of the hartebeest: characterized by extreme elongation, and the fusion and posterior placement of the horn pedicels. However, its postcrania and proportions are largely reminiscent of wildebeest: for instance, axes from Megalotragus are robust and compact, suggesting it had a robust, muscular neck that was likely held horizontally, much like black wildebeest.
The nasal region of Megalotragus (with the exception of Megalotragus priscus) is inflated and forms a domed structure. This is similar to the related Rusingoryx (once included in Megalotragus) but not as extreme. The type species M. kattwinkeli has relatively short, curved horns. M. isaaci possessed longer horns, while M. priscus possessed the longest horns of all three species.
