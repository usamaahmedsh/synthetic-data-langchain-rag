Nesoryzomys indefessus, also known as the Santa Cruz nesoryzomys or Indefatigable Galápagos mouse, is an extinct species of rodent from the genus Nesoryzomys of family Cricetidae from Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. It formerly lived on Santa Cruz Island, as well as Baltra Island, but is now extinct, probably due to the introduction of black rats. Another related rodent, N. narboroughi, is sometimes considered to be a subspecies of N. indefessus.


== Etymology ==
Its specific name is Latin for "unwearied, indefatigable", but the species was named after its island, which was formerly known as "Indefatigable Island" after a ship with the same name.
