Industrial processes are procedures involving chemical, physical, electrical, or mechanical steps to aid in the manufacturing of an item or items, usually carried out on a very large scale. Industrial processes are the key components of heavy industry.


== Chemical processes by main basic material ==

Certain chemical process yield important basic materials for society, e.g., (cement, steel, aluminum, and fertilizer). However, these chemical reactions contribute to climate change by emitting carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, through chemical reactions, as well as through the combustion of fossil fuels to generate the high temperatures needed to reach the activation energies of the chemical reactions.


=== Cement (the paste within concrete) ===
Calcination – Limestone, which is largely composed of fossilized calcium carbonate (CaCO3), breaks down at high temperatures into useable calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide gas (CO2), which gets released as a by-product. This chemical reaction, called calcination, figures most prominently in creating cement (the paste within concrete). The reaction is also important in providing calcium oxide to act as a chemical flux (removal of impurities) within a blast furnace.
CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)


=== Steel ===
Smelting – Inside a blast furnace, carbon monoxide (CO) is released by combusting coke (a high-carbon derivative of coal) and removes the undesired oxygen (O) within ores. CO2 is released as a by-product, carrying away the oxygen and leaving behind the desired pure metal. Most prominently, iron smelting is how steel (largely iron with small amounts of carbon) is created from mined iron ore and coal.
Fe2O3(s) + 3 CO(g) → 2 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g)


=== Aluminium ===
Hall–Héroult process – Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) is smelted with coke (C) in a high-temperature electrolysis reaction, yielding the desired pure aluminium (Al) and a mixture of CO and CO2.
Al2O3(s) + 3 C(s) → 2 Al(s) + 3 CO(g)
2 Al2O3(s) + 3 C(s) → 4 Al(s) + 3 CO2(g)


=== Fertilizer ===
Haber process – Atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is separated, yielding ammonia (NH3), which is used to make all synthetic fertilizer. The Haber process uses a fossil carbon source, generally natural gas, to provide the CO for the water–gas shift reaction, yielding hydrogen (H2) and releasing CO2. The H2 is used to break the strong triple bond in N2, yielding industrial ammonia.
CH4(g) + H2O(g) → CO(g) + 3 H2(g)
CO(g) + H2O(g) → H2(g) + CO2(g)
N2(g) + 3 H2(g) → 2 NH3(g)


=== Other chemical processes ===
Disinfection – chemical treatment to kill bacteria and viruses
Pyroprocessing – using heat to chemically combine materials, such as in cement


== Electrolysis ==

The availability of electricity and its effect on materials gave rise to several processes for plating or separating metals.

Electrolytic process – any process using electrolysis

Electropolishing – the reverse of electroplating
Electrotyping – using electroplating to produce printing plates
Gilding, electroplating, anodizing, electrowinning – depositing a material on an electrode
