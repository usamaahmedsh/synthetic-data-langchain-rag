Beyond the Limits is a 1992 book continuing the modeling of the consequences of a rapidly growing global population that was started in the 1972 report Limits to Growth. Donella Meadows, Dennis Meadows, and Jørgen Randers are the authors and all were involved in the original Club of Rome study as well.  Beyond the Limits (Chelsea Green Publishing Company) and Earthscan addressed many of the criticisms of the Limits to Growth book, but still has caused controversy and mixed reactions.
