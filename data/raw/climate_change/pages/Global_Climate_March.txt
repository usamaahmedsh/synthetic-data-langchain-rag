The Global Climate March took place in various cities around the world on 29 November 2015, the day before the opening of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The march was organized by a huge coalition of climate groups and global activists (such as Avaaz and the international environmental organization 350.org), and involved more than 2,000 events around the globe, in 175 countries. An estimated number of 785,000 people took part at the marches.
On 30 November, the first day of the conference, a "Climate strike" was organised by students in over 100 countries; over 50,000 people participated.
Follow-on marches scheduled in 2017 included the March for Science on 22 April 2017) and the People's Climate Mobilization on 29 April 2017.
