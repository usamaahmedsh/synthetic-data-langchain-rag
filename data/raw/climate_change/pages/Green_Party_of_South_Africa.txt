== History of Green politics in South Africa ==

The Ecology Party was established in November 1989, but disbanded after recruiting only 1 800 members.
Ian Brownlie launched the Green Party (GRP) in July 1992, but it too disbanded after failing to win a seat in the Western Cape Provincial legislature during the 1994 Provincial and National general elections under the leadership of Nathan Grant.
Judy Sole founded the Government by the People Green Party (GPGP) in 1999, which she later renamed to The Green Party of South Africa. The party has contested elections as the Green Party of South Africa since the 2000 local elections. Due to the lack of funding the Green Party of South Africa only participated in the 2004 provincial elections but was reconstituted in early February 2019 to contest the provincial elections.
