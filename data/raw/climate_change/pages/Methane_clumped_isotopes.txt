Methane clumped isotopes are methane molecules that contain two or more rare isotopes. Methane (CH4) contains two elements, carbon and hydrogen, each of which has two stable isotopes. For carbon, 98.9% are in the form of carbon-12 (12C) and 1.1% are carbon-13 (13C); while for hydrogen, 99.99% are in the form of protium (1H) and 0.01% are deuterium (2H or D). Carbon-13 (13C) and deuterium (2H or D) are rare isotopes in methane molecules. The abundance of the clumped isotopes provides information independent from the traditional carbon or hydrogen isotope composition of methane molecules.


== Introduction ==
Isotopologues are molecules that have the same chemical composition, but differ only in their isotopic composition. Methane has ten stable isotopologues: 12CH4, 13CH4, 12CH3D, 13CH3D, 12CH2D2, 13CH2D2, 12CHD3, 13CHD3, 12CD4 and 13CD4, among which, 12CH4 is an unsubstituted isotopologue; 13CH4 and 12CH3D are singly substituted isotopologues; 13CH3D and 12CH2D2 are doubly substituted isotopologues. The multiple-substituted isotopologues are clumped isotopologues.
The absolute abundance of each isotopologue primarily depends on the traditional carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions (δ13C and δD) of the molecules. Clumped isotope composition is calculated relative to the random distribution of carbon and hydrogen isotopes in the methane molecules. The deviations from the random distribution is the key signature of methane clumped isotope (please see "notation" for details).
In thermodynamic equilibrium, methane clumped isotopologue composition has a monotonic relationship with formation temperature. This is the condition for many geological environments so that methane clumped isotope can record its formation temperature, and therefore can be used to identify the origins of methane. When methane clumped-isotope composition is controlled by kinetic effects, for example, for microbial methane, it has the potential to be used to study metabolism.
The study of methane clumped isotopologues is very recent. The first mass spectrometry measurement of methane clumped isotopologues of natural abundance was made in 2014. This is a very young and fast-growing field.

Assuming isotopes are randomly distributed throughout all isotopologues and isotopes are of natural abundance.

=== Δ notation ===
The Δ notation of clumped isotopes is an analogue to δ notation of traditional isotopes (e.g. δ13C, δ18O, δ15N, δ34S and δD).
The notation of traditional isotopes are defined as:

    {\displaystyle R_{sample}}
  
 is rather small, in the convenience of comparison between difference samples, the notation is define as a ratio minus 1 and expressed in permil (‰).
The Δ notation is inherited from traditional δ notation. But the reference is not a physical reference material. Instead, the reference frame is defined as the stochastic distribution of isotopologues in the sample. It means the values of Δ are to denote the excess or deficit of the isotopologue relative to the amount expected if a material conforms to the stochastic distribution.

The two Δ formulas are frequently used to report the abundance of clumped isotopologues of methane.
The reason for choosing stochastic distribution as the reference frame may be historical - in the process of developing CO2 clumped isotope measurement, the only material with known clumped isotope abundance was CO2 heated to 1000 °C. However, this reference frame is a good choice. Because the absolute abundance of each isotopologue primarily depends on the bulk carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions (δ13C and δD) of the molecules, i.e. very close to stochastic distribution. Therefore, the deviation from the stochastic distribution, which is the key information embedded in the methane clumped isotopologues, is denoted by Δ values.


=== Mass-18 notation ===
Under some circumstances, the abundances of 13CH3D and 12CH2D2 isotopologues are only measured as a sum, which leads to the notation for isotopologues of mass-18 (i.e. 13CH3D and 12CH2D2):

=== Equilibrium thermodynamics ===
When formed or re-equilibrated in reversible reactions, methane molecules can exchange isotopes with each other or with other substances present, such as H2O, H2 and CO2, and reach internal isotopic equilibrium. As a result, clumped isotopologues are enriched relative to the stochastic distribution.

, as in "Notation"), which are non-linear polynomial functions of δD and δ13C values. Such non-linearity can be a diagnostic signature for mixing if multiple samples of various mixing ratios can be measured. When end-members have similar δ13C or δD compositions, the non-linearity is negligible.   


== Measurement techniques ==


=== Mass spectrometry ===
On an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer, the measurement of clumped isotopologues has to be conducted on intact methane molecules, instead of converting methane to CO2, H2 or H2O. High mass resolution is required to distinguish different isotopologues of very close relative molecular mass (same "cardinal mass", e.g. 13CH4 and 12CH3D (17.03465 Da (daltons) versus 17.03758 Da), 13CH3D and 12CH2D2 (18.04093 Da versus 18.04385 Da). Currently, two commercial models capable of such measurement are Thermo Scientific 253 Ultra and the Panorama by Nu Instruments.


=== Infrared spectroscopy ===
Tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS) has been developed to measure the abundance of 13CH3D with two continuous wave quantum cascade lasers.


== Theoretical studies ==
There have been several theoretical studies on equilibrium thermodynamics of methane clumped isotopologues since 2008. These studies are based on ab initio, from underlying physical chemistry principles, and do not rely on empirical, or lab-based, data.
Ma et al. utilized first-principle quantum mechanism molecular calculation (Density Functional Theory, or DFT) to study the temperature dependence of the 13CH3D abundance. Cao and Liu estimated

°C), which aligns well with modeled results of methane formation temperature and yield. However, some thermogenic methane samples have clumped-isotope temperatures that are unrealistically high. Possible explanations for exceedingly high clumped isotope temperatures include natural gas migration after formation, mixing effect, and kinetic isotope effect of secondary cracking.


=== Biosphere ===
Methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic respiration used by microbes, and microbial methanogenesis can occur in deep subsurface, marine sediments, freshwater bodies, etc. It appears that methane from deep subsurface and marine sediment is generally in internal isotopic equilibrium., while freshwater microbial methanogenesis expresses large kinetic isotope effect on methane clumped isotope composition.
There are two possible explanations for this variance: firstly, substrate limitation may enhance the reversibility of methanogenesis, thus allowing methane to achieve internal isotopic equilibrium via rapid hydrogen exchange with water; secondly, activation of C-H bonds during anaerobic oxidation precedes reversibly such that C-H bonds are broken and reformed faster than the net rate of methane consumption and methane can be reequilibrated.

 values of methane in internal isotopic equilibrium. As there are assumptions and approximations in calculations, the equilibrium distribution is only experimentally validated after the analysis of samples brought to thermodynamic equilibrium. Nickel and platinum catalysts have been used to equilibrate methane C-H bonds at various temperatures from 150 to 500 °C in laboratory. Currently, catalytic equilibration is also the practice to develop the reference material for clumped isotope analysis .


=== Microbial culture ===
Hydrogenotrophic methanogens utilize CO2 and H2 to produce methane by the following reaction:

CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O
Acetoclastic methanogens metabolize acetate acid and produce methane:

CH3COOH → CH4 + CO2
In laboratories, clumped isotope compositions of methane generated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens, acetoclastic methanogens (biodegradation of acetate), and methylotrophic methanogens are universally out of equilibria. It has been proposed that the reversibility of methanogenic enzyme is key to the kinetic isotope effect expressed in biogenic methane.

== Applications ==


=== Distinguishing origins of natural gas ===
Biogenic, thermogenic and abiotic methane is formed at different temperatures, which can be recorded in clumped isotope compositions of methane. Combined with conventional carbon and hydrogen isotope fingerprints and gas wetness (the abundance of low molecular weight hydrocarbon), methane clumped isotope can be used to identify the origins of methane in different types of natural gas accumulations.


=== Biogeochemistry of microbial methane ===
