The Ecologist Greens (Greek: Οικολόγοι Πράσινοι, Oikologoi Prasinoi) are a green political party in Greece. The party was founded in 2002 as a federation of ecological groups and movements, including Prasini Politiki ("Green Politics").  
The Ecologist Greens identify with green politics and environmentalism, combining ecological sustainability with social justice, participatory democracy, and human rights. They have been associated with the European Green Party, although their membership rights were suspended in December 2023.  
The party first gained national attention in the 2009 European Parliament election, when it won 3.49% of the vote and elected one Member of the European Parliament. Since then its vote share has declined, and it has not won parliamentary representation in the Hellenic Parliament. In the May 2023 election it received 0.60% of the vote, and in the repeat election of June 2023 this fell to 0.41%.
In February 2024, the Ecologist Greens merged with the party Greens–Solidarity and other activists to form a new green political formation under the name Green–Ecology. The new party adopted the manifesto of the European Green Party, with Vasiliki Grammatikogianni and Ilias Gianniris elected as co-leaders.


== History ==
The political party Prasini Politiki (Greek: Πράσινη Πολιτική, "Green Politics"), the body that lead to the establishment of the party under the name "Oikologoi Prasinoi", was founded in 1996 and already registered as the Greek member of the European Green Party, including other local ecological groups and independent ecologists, like the Ecological Forum (Οικολογικό Φόρουμ) and the Ecological Movement of Thessaloniki.
During 7–8 December 2002, the "Prasini Politiki" council called for a conference that convened in the building of the Athens Lawyer Association, and it decided to establish the Ecologist Greens and elected an 18-member council to coordinate the establishment of a new political entity. In the coming months, focus groups were created to shape the constitution and the political positions of the body, which were adopted by the first congress of the party in May 2003 at Panteion University.
In January 2015, the Ecologist Greens decided to collaborate with SYRIZA. Alexis Tsipras' called for unity against the Memorandum and the Ecologist Greens decided to support SYRIZA's electoral list for the upcoming legislative election. One Ecologist Green MP was elected on the SYRIZA ticket, Giorgos Dimaras, and another Ecologist Green, Giannis Tsironis, was appointed Alternate Minister of Environment and Energy in the first Tsipras Cabinet.
Giorgos Dimaras was reelected and Giannis Tsironis was elected for the first time. Tsironis was reappointed as Alternate Minister of Environment in the second Tsipras cabinet on 23 September 2015.
