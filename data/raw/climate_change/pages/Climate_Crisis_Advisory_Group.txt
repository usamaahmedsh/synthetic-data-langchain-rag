The Climate Crisis Advisory Group (CCAG) is an independent group of scientists which advises on climate change and biodiversity, headed by Sir David King.
Its goal is to  "provide the global public with regular analysis about efforts to tackle the global heating and biodiversity crises".
CCAG's launch statement and first report  state that the Earth may have already passed several dangerous tipping points, including melting ice sheets, the slowdown of Atlantic circulation and the dieback of the Amazon rainforest, which highlight the need for speed.
