The campaign was unveiled on 12 October 2019 at the National Education Union's Climate Emergency Conference, in front of a room full of educational specialists and campaigners. Two days after the campaign unveiling, Teach the Future began a petition for broader climate education across the country which has gathered more than 27,000 signatures.
