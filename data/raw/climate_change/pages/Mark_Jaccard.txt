Mark Kenneth Jaccard (born April 12, 1955) is a Canadian energy economist and author. He develops and applies models that assess sustainability policies for energy and material. Jaccard is a professor of sustainable energy in the School of Resource and Environmental Management (REM) at Simon Fraser University.


== Biography ==
Jaccard was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. His PhD is from the Energy Economics and Policy Institute at the University of Grenoble (now called Université Grenoble Alpes). Jaccard has been a professor at Simon Fraser University since 1986, where he teaches courses in environment and resource economics, sustainable energy and materials, and energy and materials economic and policy modeling. His research focuses on the development and application of energy-economy-emissions models that simulate the likely effects of sustainable energy policies. He has over 100 academic publications. He advises governments, industry and non-government organizations around the world.
Jaccard served as Chair and CEO of the B.C. Utilities Commission (1992 to 1997), on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (1993–96, 2008–09), and on the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (1996-2001, 2008–09). In his latest work for the China Council, he was co-chair of a task force on sustainable use of coal, reporting to the Premier of China. In 2007-12 he served as convening lead author for energy policy in the production of the Global Energy Assessment. He served on Canada’s National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy (2006–09) and since 2006 has been a research fellow at the C.D. Howe Institute. In 2005, his book, Sustainable Fossil Fuels won the Donner Prize for top policy book in Canada. In 2008, he was named Academic of the Year by the Association of British Columbia faculty members. In 2009, he was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada for his lifetime research. In 2012, Jaccard was a recipient of Canada's Clean16 and Clean 50 awards, in recognition of his contributions to sustainability education in Canada. In 2014, he received Simon Fraser University’s first Professor Award for Sustainability, and in that year was also appointed to a distinguished chair as SFU University Professor.
