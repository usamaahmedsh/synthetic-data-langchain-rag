Climate Action Tracker (CAT) is an independent scientific project with the aim of monitoring government action to achieve their reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with regard to international agreements – specifically the globally agreed Paris Agreement aim of "holding warming well below 2°C, and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.". It is tracking climate action in 39 countries and the EU responsible for over 85% of global emissions. The CAT is the product of two organisations: NewClimate Institute [1] and Climate Analytics [2].
The actions it tracks are:
- Effect of climate policies and action on emissions.
- Impact of pledges, targets and NDCs on national emissions over the time period to 2030, and where possible beyond.
- Comparability of effort against countries' fair share and modelled domestic pathways.


== COP26 ==
Toward the end of the COP26 climate conference, CAT produced a report concluding that the current "wave of net‑zero emission goals [are] not matched by action on the ground" and that the world is likely headed for more than 2.4 °C of warming by the end of the century.
