The Gallery Climate Coalition was established in 2020 to address the carbon footprint of the international art market. As of 2025, it had grown to 1800 members and its goals are in alignment with the Paris Accord as far as a timeline for impact reduction. While non-profit organizations including the Tate have addressed climate change and art's impact thereon, this is thought to be the first action taken by the commercial art world.
Founding parties include: Thomas Dane, Kate MacGarry, Lisson Gallery's Sadie Coles and Greg Hilty, Frieze Art Fair co-founder Matthew Slotover and director Victoria Siddall.
In 2025, Frances Morris, the former head of the Tate Modern was named the Coalition's inaugural chair.
