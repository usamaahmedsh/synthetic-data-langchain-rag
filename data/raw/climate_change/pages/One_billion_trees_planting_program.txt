The One Billion Tree Planting Project is an Iranian government project to plant trees from 2021-2025.
In 2021, the government directed the Minister of Agriculture Jihad, the Natural Resources and Watershed Management Organization, and the Department of Environment to conduct the program.
Iran's water crisis fed doubts about the project's viability.

Three hundred million trees were to be planted by the government. 250 million saplings were to be produced annually. Project goals include to revitalize natural jungles, to farm trees, to increase urban green space, and to counter sandstorms.
