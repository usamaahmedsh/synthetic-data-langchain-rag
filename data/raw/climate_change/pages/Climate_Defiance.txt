Climate Defiance is a climate movement organization in the United States which uses direct action protests to demand stronger climate change mitigation policies. The organization mostly focuses on protesting Democratic officials and disrupting their events. While their efforts gain press attention, their efficacy is disputed.
Climate Defiance disrupted the 2023 White House Correspondents Dinner, an event for Exxon CEO Darren Woods, and the speaking events of several powerful Democratic officials, including Tommy Beaudreau, Pete Buttigieg, Jennifer Granholm, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Manchin, Jerome Powell, and Ali Zaidi. After these actions, the group received a private meeting with White House adviser John Podesta.
Climate Defiance is supported by Margaret Klein Salamon's Climate Emergency Fund, which provides about half of Climate Defiance's budget.
