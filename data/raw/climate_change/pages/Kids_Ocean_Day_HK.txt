Kids Ocean Day HK  was organised by Ocean Recovery Alliance to celebrate Kids Ocean Day in Hong Kong.


== Foundation ==
The Malibu Foundation, a California-based non-profit organisation, started Kids Ocean Day to connect children to the ocean and beaches, and to foster understanding of the environmental issues they face. The first Kids Ocean Day Hong Kong was celebrated 9 November 2012. Over 800 students, teachers and volunteers met at Repulse Bay and helped create a piece of aerial artwork featuring a Chinese white dolphin, organised by aerial artist John Quigley of Spectral Q. The design was based on 9-year-old Leung Man-Hin's artwork which won the drawing competition for the event.


== Goal ==
To raise awareness, understanding and appreciation among Hong Kong youth about the state of the ocean and the health of its ecosystem.
