Climate change presents a direct danger to the environment, economy, and people of Mauritius it being a picturesque island nation in the Indian Ocean. Sea-level increase, natural disasters, and deterioration of life-sustaining ecosystems are challenges facing the island. All these have to be addressed and will need an environmental effort from the communities, individuals, and the world. These effects are endangering the nation's coastal regions, altering infrastructure and freshwater, and have already been seen in increasing temperatures and unexpected climatic conditions. National planning is establishing resilience in Mauritius, including the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.


== Greenhouse gas emissions ==
In 2023, Mauritius emitted about 4.909 million tones of greenhouse gases, a bit higher than in the previous year. Per capita emissions also rose to 4.843 tones of CO2 equivalent. As an island developing state, Mauritius is subject to climate change impacts, especially sea-level rise and weather-related events. To achieve this, the government committed itself to cutting emissions by 40% by the year 2030 and has taken several steps, such as higher usage of renewable energy and better waste management.
In 2022, Mauritius accounted for 0.01% of global emissions, producing 4.02 million tonnes of CO₂ from fuel combustion, a 65% increase from 2000 levels. In the same year, the CO2 emissions per capita was 3.184 tCO2 / Capita which was about 55% increase from the year 2000.

== Impact on the natural environment ==


=== Temperature and weather ===
Climate change is affecting Mauritius in the form of increased temperature, enhanced heatwaves, and reduction in total annual rainfall, with the effect of longer dry seasons and increased flash flood risk. Increased intensity of tropical cyclones and sea level rise, causing coastal erosion and posing threats to infrastructure, are other effects. Climate changes adversely impact water resources, public health, agriculture, and coastal.

Mauritius island has been warming by 0.0216 °C/year over the 1971-2020 period and that rainfall has risen on average by 2.29 mm/year during 1981-2020. The evolving climate over time has had catastrophic impacts on the indigenous ecosystem of the island and poses risks to the long-term water supply system.


=== Impact on water resources ===
Climate change has affected Mauritius's water resources by producing unpredictable rainfall, increased droughts, and more severe heavy rainfall events. This translates into varying reservoir levels, subjecting fresh water supplies to stress, and intensified flooding, further contaminating the surface and groundwater resources and compromising water security. Research show that rainfall pattern of the last 89 years (1931-2020) in Mauritius rainfall decreased hence affecting agriculture, livelihoods, Industries and business.


=== Ecosystems ===
Mauritian's ecosystems has been affect to a large extent through increased sea levels, more intense cyclones, and increased ocean temperatures that cause coral bleaching, coastal erosion, and pose dangers to marine life and coastal towns. The effects ravage key habitats such as coral reefs and mangroves, excessive exploitation of fisheries, and jeopardize the economy of tourism that depends on an uninterrupted coastal ecosystem.


== Impact on people ==
Mauritius faces serious economic risks from climate change. These risks arise because its economy depends heavily on climate-sensitive sectors including tourism, fisheries, agriculture, coastal infrastructure.


=== Tourism ===

Tourism contributes approximately 20% to GDP and is the employer of approximately 22% of Mauritius' workforce.Sea level rise, coastal erosion, coral bleaching, increased storm intensity, and beach deterioration decrease the attractiveness of Mauritius as a destination. A projection estimates beach erosion will lose up to USD 50 million in revenues by 2050.


=== Fisheries and marine resources ===
Its fisheries are threatened by ocean warming, shifting ranges of species, loss of coral reef habitats, and the pressure from invasive species. Changes or declines in fish populations would impact exports as well as the livelihood of coastal residents. 


=== Agriculture ===

Shifting rain patterns, rising pressure from drought, more intense and more frequent storms, and soil erosion lower crop and livestock production particularly traditionally significant crop such as the sugar industry is highly vulnerable to extremes (cyclones, floods).


=== Health impacts ===

Climate change poses documented health risks in Mauritius. National and international assessments identify rising temperatures, heavier rainfall, sea level rise, and stronger cyclones as key hazards, with effects on disease transmission, injuries, and health system performance.


==== Vector-borne diseases ====
Warmer temperatures and altered rainfall expand suitable conditions for Aedes mosquitoes and can accelerate viral replication. Mauritius has a history of chikungunya and dengue outbreaks, and the current global resurgence of chikungunya includes the south-west Indian Ocean region. Public health agencies link part of this risk to climate change.


==== Heat stress ====
Higher maximum temperatures raise risks of heat illness, especially for older adults, outdoor workers, and people with chronic disease. Climate models used by the World Bank show increasing heat risk across the islands.


==== Water- and food-borne disease ====
Intense rainfall and flooding compromise water quality and sanitation and can increase gastroenteritis and other enteric infections. Coastal flooding may also affect shellfish safety. The WHO country profile cites these pathways for small island states, including Mauritius.


== Mitigation and adaptation ==
Mauritius has a framework climate law, the Climate Change Act 2020, which establishes an Inter-Ministerial Council on Climate Change and a Department of Climate Change to steer policy toward a low-emission and climate-resilient economy.
In September 2025 the government filed its third Nationally Determined Contribution. It targets a 40 percent reduction of economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared to a business-as-usual pathway, with sectoral measures in energy, transport, waste, AFOLU, and IPPU.
The updated NDC framework also raises energy ambitions to 60 percent power generation from green sources by 2030, a coal phase-out, and a 10 percent improvement in energy efficiency from a 2019 baseline. Domestic finance is expected to cover 35 percent of climate action costs.
