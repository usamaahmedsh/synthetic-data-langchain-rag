Jagiellońska Street is a historic street in the centre of Bydgoszcz in Poland.


== Location ==

The street is located in the heart of Bydgoszcz. It stretches on an east–west axis, from Fordon roundabout to the intersection with Gdańska Street. It is approximately 2.2 km long. Jagiellońska Street joins the Old Town and Downtown district of Bydgoszcz.


== History ==
The Jagiellońska Street is on the path of a medieval communication route between Bydgoszcz castle and Fordon on the Vistula river: since the mid-13th century, the only permanent crossing of the Brda river was the bridge of Bydgoszcz Old Town where customs duties were collected. This road was leaving the town from the "Gdansk Gate" and was running eastward following the northern side of the Brda river. In Fordon, it was possible to cross the Vistula river to get to Chełmno Land or follow northeast along the Lower Vistula valley towards Swiecie and Gdańsk.
The course of the road, coinciding with the current street, is visible on the oldest known plan of Bydgoszcz, by Swedish Count Erik Dahlbergh in 1657. In the 17th–18th century, the road was connected with the farming cities and villages located in the east: Grodztwo, Bartodzieje, Zimna Woda, Bartodzieje Małe and Fordonek.

In 1867, the village of Grodztwo was incorporated into Bydgoszcz territory, pushing further east the limit of the town (in the area of today's Oginski Street). Another extension of the borders occurred in 1920, reaching current city borders: the ancient medieval path is now covered by Jagiellońska and Fordonska streets course. During the interwar period, Jagiellońska Street ended on Maximilian Piotrowski Street, the eastern remaining path being called "Promenade street".
The development of Jagiellońska Street as an important and chic area started in the 1830s, with the construction of grand edifices like the building by Prussian administrative authorities of the Regional Office (Polish: Budynek Urzędu Wojewódzkiego). Later on, Grodztwo section gradually became an official area, with administrative, educational and cultural activities. In 1840, the axis so far called "road to Fordon" (German: Der Weg von Vordon) was named Wilhelmstrasse in honor of the King Frederick William IV of Prussia. In 1870–1872, the construction of a new steel bridge on the Brda river, the Bernardyńska Street was created, joining Jagiellońska and the river.

In the second half of the 19th century a number of official buildings have been erected along the street, such as:

The military hospital (1850–1852), now the building of the University of Medicine UMK in Bydgoszcz;
The Reichsbank building (1863–1864), now local seat of the National Bank of Poland (NBP);
The municipal School for Boys, German: Bürgerschule (1872), now an administrative building of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship;
The Civic School for Girls, German: Städtische mitlere Töchterschule (1875–1878), now the School of Fine Arts in Bydgoszcz;
The Main Post Office building (1896–1899).
At the same period, on the eastern limit of Bydgoszcz, hence in the vicinity of Jagiellońska Street, other urban edifices have been erected:

The gas workplant (1860);
The city slaughterhouse (1893).

Some buildings have been designed by famous architects of their time, like Bydgoszcz-born Józef Święcicki or Heinrich Seeling from Berlin.
After World War II, the increasing traffic along the axis has required to enlarge the street. Between 1969 and 1973, prolonging this avenue led to the creation of Fordońska street to the east, improving traffic conditions in this area of Bydgoszcz. In 1974, the completion of the streets modernization also allowed Jagiellońska and Focha streets to have a dual carriageway with a middle track for trams, in addition Jagiellonska roundabout was built with an underground passage for pedestrians.
In 2013 the University Bridge was built, crossing over Jagiellońska Street and the Brda river on a north–south axis.

The oldest buildings of the Regional Office was built between 1834 and 1836 as the seat of a Prussian region (Polish: Rejencja), an administrative unit established in 1815 within the Grand Duchy of Posen. Before its construction, officials of the Netze District have been meeting in the 1778-building on the Old Market Square (now the Provincial and Municipal Public Library). The development of the institutions required a new administrative building. The foundation stone of the building was laid on 8 June 1834. The construction was carried out in two years two years under the supervision of Carl Adler, advised by Karl Friedrich Schinkel working in Berlin. Construction manager was Friedrich Obuch, a Bydgoszcz regency councilor.
In the years 1863–64, the building was extended by two small avant-corps on each side. In 1898–1900, the edifice was partially reconstructed and added four wing in the corners, under the supervision of Mr Busse, a national project building inspector. Originally in the basement were located the housing and laundry services, the lithography facility and the fuel storage. On the ground floor were set bureaus, offices, the cadastre district department and the finance branch. On the first floor, in addition to the presidential salon, there were a reading room, a library and a conference room.

1850–1852
Functionalism
The building was erected between 1850 and 1852, as Bromberg hospital garrison. It was located then at the crossroads of Wilhelmstrasse and Hempelstrasse. The latter was marked with a wall of brick, whereas the former had a fence with iron wrought bars with a gate and a wicket. The main building, U-shaped, was a monumental edifice of brick facades, with a three-storey body, flanked by 2 avant-corps in its corners: they were higher than the facade and topped with battlements, like medieval towers. Originally the building had a symmetrical facade along a two-storey avant-corps topped with battlements, where was located the main entrance, and three extra barracks for the sick. Additional elements were built regularly until 1910:

In the back of the lot in 1881 an outbuilding was constructed;
In 1890–91, a new western edifice part housed hospital administration and direction;
In 1910, a new, ground-floor morgue was built.
In 1919, with the rebirth of the Polish state, municipal authorities took over the hospital from the Prussian forces. The size of Bydgoszcz garrison and the proximity with the fighting area of Polish–Soviet War increased significantly the activity of the institution: in 1920, under the command of Poznań General District, the medical capacity of the institution reached the maximum amount of 1,140 beds. After the conflict, the number of hospitalized patients steadily decreased: 320 beds (1922), 300 beds (1923) and 200 beds (1924–25). In 1928, Toruń military authorities decided to stop the activity of the hospital, which had only 100 beds left, keeping only the District Hospital in Toruń. In this way, Bydgoszcz remained without Military medical department till 1939.
During Nazi occupation, the building was used as a German military hospital.
After the liberation of Bydgoszcz, from 26 January to 10 February 1945, hospital buildings accommodated a Mobile Field Surgical Hospital of the Polish Army. In 1948, a huge renovation occurred, including the expansion of the main building and the demolition of five minor edifices. The renovated complex housed the Provincial Council of Polish Communist Party till the end of the communist era.
In 1990, the edifice became the property of the Regional Treasure Department: at that time, several buildings passed under the ownership of the Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, which located here offices of the rector, two deaneries, college administrators, some classrooms, a cafeteria and an additional dormitory. Around 2000, with Tax and Revenue office leaving the premises, the whole building fell under the responsibility of the university.
From the former buildings of the garrison hospital, only the U-shaped footprint is left. It was initially constructed in the style of historicism, using forms of Neo-Romanesque. Its appearance resembled a fortress, but these stylistic features have been lost during the complex reconstruction carried out in 1947–1948, which also wiped away the avant-corps, changed the size and shape of the windows, added a fourth floor and extended the gable to the whole edifice.

In 2015, discussions started to plan a major renovation of the facility.  In mid-2019, thermomodernization works of the building were completed: outside facades were completely insulated and gained a new aesthetic look in shades of white and gray and a 18-KW photovoltaic installation was set up on the roof.
In the Palace of Youth, particular attention has been paid from the beginning to the standard of its equipment and the selection of experienced staff.

=== Park "Władysław II Jagiełło" ===
0,5 ha
1844
The park is delimited by streets Jagiellońska and Uroczą, and by the Brda river to the south. Its current area is only 50x100m, reduced by the presence of a post war building of the Polish Federation of Engineering Associations (Polish: Naczelna Organizacja Techniczna NOT).
The park was founded in 1844, with an area of 0.7 ha. Its original name was "Town Park" (German: Stadt Park). The main entrance was from Jagiellońska street, and comprised a garden with a large lawn adjacent to the Brda river. In the early 20th century, the park was separated from the river by low buildings.
A general reconstruction took place in 1929-1930 when the park was renamed after Władysław II Jagiełło: a granite fence and a rose flowered trellis were built along Jagiellońska street, a second entrance was created on Uroczą street. The main attraction of the area was a large fountain with a paddling pool. In 1939, the foliage on Jagiellońska street was so dense that one could not see the center of the park from the street.
Just before the outbreak of World War II, 45 species of trees and shrubs were growing in the park.
On 16 February 1974, in the southern part of the area was built the Bydgoszcz House of Technology or Dom Technika NOT (Polish: Naczelna Organizacji Techniczny, Polish Federation of Technics), by architect Stefan Klajbor, and in the eastern part, from 1973 to 1975, have been erected offices.
The remaining plot is used as a square, in the middle of which was a fountain, which served as an open pool: today it is a flowered area. Sculptures also adorns the garden.


=== Robert Aron Tenement, at 36 ===
Built in 1893–1894, by architect Józef Święcicki
Neo-renaissance & Mannerism
This residential building was completed for Robert Aron, a merchant and manufacturer who started in 1889 a business in the production and sale of tar roofing materials. At the time, the address was "Wilhemstrasse 45". 
Aron's factory employed at the end of the 19th century up to 40 workers and occupied the entire plot between the street and the Brda river. The plant has been active till the start of World War II.
The building has a mansard roof, and initially housed two 7-room apartments.
In 2017, on the left façade of the building has been realized a mural entitled "Kazimierz". Created by Bartosz Bujanowski, it is based on a legend depicting King Casimir the Great meeting a beautiful huntress called Bydgoszcza. This work is a part of an ensemble of more than 20 pieces scattered in Bydgoszcz streets.

=== City Slaughterhouse, at 41/47 ===
Registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list, Nr.601351-Reg.A/505/1-6 (23 April 1998).
1890–1910, by Carl Meyer
Historicism
The plant was opened on 3 July 1890, designed by architect Carl Meyer. It was located in the former eastern outskirts of the city, near the Gasworks plot. Both companies have been using the 1892 rail track section, which ran along today's Oginski street. The complex comprises four historic buildings. First one (Nr.47) was established in 1893, another in 1897: they comprised administrative and residential buildings, two slaughterhouse halls, a pig house, a firehouse, an intestinal treatment plant, a market place, a butcher's chamber, a water tower, a boiler room, a cold room, a slaughterhouse for sick animals, and a stable. An extension of the complex occurred in 1909 and 1910, including among others, a cash register, rooms for accounting, a room for the vet department, an apartment for the porter and a 6-room apartment for the Slaughterhouse Director. The ensemble was part of the municipal slaughterhouse and meat trade in Bydgoszcz, together with the factory itself. In 1894, a 2 ha plot around the slaughterhouse was established as a trade centre.
In 1920, the company passed into Polish hands, and grew in size: in 1928, company "Bacon Export SA" was established in Gniezno, in 1929–1930, a new bacon processing factory gas been built on site, along Piotrkowski street. The slaughterhouse produced for the local market and also exported abroad. Its best seller to United Kingdom during interwar period was bacon. In 1938, the author J. D. Salinger worked at the slaughterhouse to learn about the meat-importing business.
In 1939, the plant was confiscated and run by the German army, its name was changed to Meat Products Factory "Nawag". The factory company produced bacon, sausages and canned food for the Wehrmacht.
In the years 1945–1949, factories took back their name as city slaughterhouse, subordinated to the control of Warsaw. In the 1960s, the first serious post-war investments for modernization have been realized. After a period of greatest prosperity in 60s and 70s, the slaughterhouse was hit by the economic crisis. In addition, in 1991, Bydgoszcz plants lost their authorization to export to European Union and United States. The need of a construction of a new modernized facility was acute, leading the way to the selling of Jagiellońska street plot in 2006. The product of the bargain provided to build from scratch a new plant at Przemysłowa street (a plot belonging to the former Bydgoszcz Gasworks), but paradoxically, this investment appeared to be hazardous, and financial problems ended with the bankruptcy of the "Bydgoszcz Meat Company" in 2008, after 118 years of operation.
In 2009, producers and former supplier established the "Bydgoskie Meat Factory" Company and resumed production in the facility at Przemysłowa street. The same year, the plant became member of the group DROBEX.
One of the most interesting edifice is the former catering and administration building at Nr.47. It is rectangular, brick-laid building, with two-storey, attic and basement. It has a four-storey tower clock in its south-east corner. Frontages are decorated with brick cornices and friezes with arcades. The south elevation displays a terrace with an openwork balustrade. The other three buildings are administrative and residential edifices. When the plot was sold in 2006, the processing factory was demolished to give place to the shopping center Focus Mall. The four historic administrative buildings have been preserved and restored.

2007–2008
International Style
The shopping center "Focus Mall" was opened on 23 April 2008 on the site of the demolished meat processing factory of "Bydgoskie Meat Plant", sold in 2006. It was, at its opening, the biggest mall in Bydgoszcz and in Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, one of the largest in Poland. It houses 150 shops and service points, and a 13 screen multiplex theatre (run by Cinema City Poland). The center has surface of 90 000 m2, including 41 0000 m2 of GLA.

=== Tenements at 51/57 ===
1900 (Nr.51)
1908 (Nr.53)
1910 (Nr.55)
Beginning 20th century (Nr.57)
Early Modern architecture
These townhouses, standing near the intersection with Oginski street, have been built in the first decade of the 20th century. This area was out of the city limits at that time: the suburb was called "Schröttersdorf" and the street "Promenadenstrasse". The first landlords of the ensemble were:

Fritz Altmann at Promenadenstrasse 1 (51 Jagiellońska)
Mr Schrödter, a butcher, at Promenadenstrasse 2 (53 Jagiellońska)
Mr Shring, a secretary in the railway company at Promenadenstrasse 3 (55 Jagiellońska)
Bernhard Pommerening at Promenadenstrasse 5 (57 Jagiellońska).
The building displays early modernist style, as one can find also at 107 Jagiellońska street or 5 Libelta street.
In 2020, on the occasion of the 25th birthday of the popular cookie "(Wafle) Familijne" (English: Family Wafers) produced by the confectionery factory "Jutrzenka" in Bydgoszcz, a mural was created at the corner with Ogiński streets.
The work called Familijne has been designed by Karol Banach. It is a part of an ensemble of more than 20 pieces scattered within Bydgoszcz.


=== Tenement at 60 ===
1910
Early Modern architecture
The plot was initially located outside of Bydgoszcz limits, in the suburban city of Schröttersdorf.
The building displays early modernist style, with some original features such as the rounded wrought iron balconies, the large triangular facade pediment and the overwhelming presence of vertical lines that confers to the edifice a look of a Greek temple. It was renovated in early 2020.


=== Antoni Jaworski Villa at 61 ===
1930s by Antoni Jaworski
Streamline Moderne
Jaworski was running a building company co-owned with architect Bronisław Jankowski, using concrete, a new material available at the time. This firm had won prosperous contracts in the sea side city of Gdynia.
After the Second World War, the building housed a public library and apartments. After its refurbishing, the villa houses since 2017 the following municipal offices:

Office for Health and Social Policy (Polish: Zdrowia i Polityki Społecznej Urzędu Miasta Bydgoszczy);
Integrated Territorial Investments office (Polish: Biuro Zintegrowanych Inwestycji Terytorialnych BTOF).
Jaworski replicated the modern streamline-Art Deco style he used on his works in Gdynia. The front door is adorned with a circular porthole-like window, and the balustrades surrounding the terrace and balconies recall bridge boat railings. Thanks to its large windows, the villa is flooded with a lot of light. Interiors are a real showcase of the skill sets of Jaworski's company, made of high-quality wood and ceramics: the main hall is paneled up to the ceiling with a colored geometric pattern on the floor and a swinging door with crystal-cut panes leads to the stairs equipped with a solid handrail. 


=== Antoni Weynerowski Villa at 62, corner with Krakowska street ===
Registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list, Nr.760205 Reg.A/1588 (10 May 2011).
1907–1908
Art Nouveau
At the time of its erection, the villa was located out of the city limits, in the suburb of Schröttersdorf, on Promenaden Straße.
After 1920 and the re-creation of the Polish state, the expansion of Bydgoszcz subsumed these neighbouring cities; villa's address was then Ulica Promenada 41, then Ulica Promenada 10, when the city gave up the Prussian street numeration.
Its first landlord, Antoni Weynerowski, was a successful manager of a large shoe factory, Leo.
In the late 1920s, the landlord was Zefiryn Rzymkowski, a merchant.
The villa, refurbished in 2014, features superb architectural details: vegetal volutes as cartouches, crying figures on top of pilasters and a corner balcony.


=== House at 63 ===
1903
Eclecticism
This area was out of the city limits at that time: the suburb was then called Schröttersdorf and the street Promenaden straße.

=== "Słoneczny Młyn" Hotel, at 96 ===
1862
Wattle and daub
The first reference of the mill dates back to 1862, but studies show that a mill facility was standing there earlier. 
The building was erected by entrepreneurs Louis Wolfen and Meyer Fließ, initially as a small steam mill with a capacity of approximately 1 ton per day. Its economic importance was then negligible. However, the location of the facility made it very convenient for transportation of grain and flour by waterways, via Brda river and the Bydgoszcz Canal.
In 1892, the mill was bought by L. Berwald, and in 1899, it was in the hand of Willi and Moritz Baerwald. They carried out a thorough upgrading and extended the building to its limits for the time: equipment comprised, among others, a new steam engine and a narrow-gauge railway to a bridge over the Brda river, where transportation barges were standing.
"Baerwald mill" daily production, from 15 to 20 tons in the late 19th century, rose up to 30 tons in the early 20th century, with a workforce of 20 to 25 people. In 1916 was built the high five-storey granary tower, today's dominant architectural item of the complex.
Bronisław Kentzer, who gave his name to the building, managed the mill from 1938 to 1939. Under his leadership, the production peaked up to 50 tons per day. In autumn 1939, he was murdered by the Nazis, probably in Fordon's Valley of Death.
In 1940 the facility was taken over by German authorities. After World War II, the building was briefly in the hands of a Cooperative,  "Społem" ("Together"), then led by Jan Kentzer. After 1948's nationalizations, the mill was managed by the State Cereal Plant in Bydgoszcz, using it to produce flour and other cereal products.
Many significant structural changes occurred afterwards: in 1961, steam engine was replaced for an electric one, and in the 1970s, offices, workshops, sheds and garages were built on the site of the demolished boiler room . At the end of the 1990s, the mill reached a record production of 100 tons of grain a day. At the same period, the company was transformed into a Joint-stock company. This did not save the firm and, in 2003, the mill complex stopped production, the buildings being put up for sale.
The property was bought by Barbara Komorowska, co-owner of the "Bakoma" company. From 2007 to 2009, the edifice was entirely refurbished and turned into a stylish four-star hotel under the name Sunny Mill (Polish: Słoneczny Młyn). 
The old granaries were demolished and other buildings were restored and integrated into a single complex. On the river side stands a cafe, along the river promenade, where the Bydgoszcz Water Tram stops. "Słoneczny Młyn" offers 96 rooms, 5 meeting rooms and a spa area. The suite in the tower offers panoramic views on Bydgoszcz. The decor refers to characteristic details of the early 20th century: Art Nouveau and Art deco. Individual floors of the hotel reflect the atmosphere of the four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, winter.
The main part of the mill building dates back to 1916, but the ensemble has experienced an important amount of transformations. It displays the architectural characteristics of early industrial buildings.
