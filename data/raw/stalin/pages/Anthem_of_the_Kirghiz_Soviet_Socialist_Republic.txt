The State Anthem of the Kirghiz SSR was the regional anthem of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the anthem has since been replaced by the State Anthem of the Kyrgyz Republic.


== History ==
The music was composed by Vladimir Vlasov, Abdylas Maldybaev and Vladimir Fere, and the lyrics were written by Kubanychbek Malikov, Tulgebai Sydykbekov, Mukanbet Toktobaev, and Aaly Tokombaev.
The anthem was used between 1946 and 1992. During de-Stalinisation in the 1950s, the lyrics were changed to remove references to Stalin. When Kyrgyzstan became independent on 31 August 1991, lyrics were removed and only the melody of the Kirghiz SSR remained in use for a short period of time. On 18 December 1992, a new anthem was officially adopted by the Supreme Council of Kyrgyzstan.
