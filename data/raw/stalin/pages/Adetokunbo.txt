Adétòkunbọ̀ (Yoruba pronunciation: [ādétòkũ̄bɔ̀] ) is both a surname and a given name of Yoruba origin meaning "the crown or royalty from across the seas (ocean)" or "the crown or royalty from a foreign land (abroad)". 
The name ultimately consists of two parts: Adé which simply means "crown/royalty" (and can also be used to form other Yorùbá names such as Adéwálẹ̀), and Tòkunbọ from ti-òkun-bọ̀ which roughly means "came (by) sea (and) arrived", and is often applied/given to Yorùbá children/people born outside of Africa, or that are majorly part of the Nigerian diaspora.
