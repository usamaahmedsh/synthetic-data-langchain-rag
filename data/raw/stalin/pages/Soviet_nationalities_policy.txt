Soviet nationalities policy was the varying policies implemented by the Soviet Union's government during its history as part of ruling over a multiethnic and multinational population, although East Slavs, particularly Russians, were dominant and favored for parts of the Soviet Union's history. Ultimately, the nationalities question was a major factor in the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
