The Khorezm People's Soviet Republic was the state created as the successor to the Khanate of Khiva in February 1920, when the Khan abdicated in response to pressure. It was officially declared by the First Khorezm Kurultay (Assembly) on 26 April 1920. On 20 October 1923, it was transformed into the Khorezm Socialist Soviet Republic..

On 27 October 1924 the Khorezm SSR was divided between the Uzbek and Turkmen SSRs and the Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast as part of the delimitation of Central Asia according to nationalities. The history of this short-lived republic remains murky and the way its government functioned is not largely clear. The government officials fervently opposed the delimitation plans of the Khorezmian Republic (which had to be carried out under Stalin’s orders) but in the end they were forced to concede.

The Khorezm People's National Republic bordered on the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to the north and to the south, and on the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic to the east. Its western border was a rough continuation of the western coast of Aral Sea, bordering on what was then the Kirghiz ASSR (today's western Kazakhstan). It had an area of 62,200 km2 (24,000 sq mi) and a population of more than 600,000 people, mainly Uzbeks (62.5%), Turkmens (28.6%), Kazakhs (3.5%), and Karakalpaks (3.0%). Its capital was Khiva.
