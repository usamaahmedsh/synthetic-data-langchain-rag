The 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (Russian: XVII съезд ВКП(б)), popularly known as the Executed Congress (as the majority of those present at the Congress were arrested and executed during the Great Purge) was held from 26 January to 10 February 1934. The congress was attended by 1,225 delegates with a casting vote and 736 delegates with a consultative vote, representing 1,872,488 party members and 935,298 candidate members.


== Events ==
During the elections to the 17th Central Committee Stalin received a significant number (over a hundred, although the precise number is unknown) of negative votes, whereas only three delegates crossed out the name of the increasingly popular, Stalin-aligned Leningrad party boss, Sergei Kirov.  The results were subsequently covered up on Stalin's orders and it was officially reported that Stalin also received only three negative votes.
During the Congress a group of veteran party members approached Kirov with the suggestion that he replace Stalin as the party leader. Kirov declined the offer and reported the conversation to Stalin, as he was very much loyal to Stalin.

In public, Stalin was acclaimed, not merely as the leader of the party, but as a towering, universal genius in every human sphere.  All his former opponents spoke approvingly of him (other than Leon Trotsky, who had been exiled in 1929), and pledged their total support to the party line.
In his speech to the 20th Party Congress, Nikita Khrushchev reported that "of the 139 members and candidates of the Central Committee who were elected at the 17th Congress, 98 persons, i.e., 70 per cent, were arrested and shot (mostly in 1937-1938)." In addition, Khrushchev said that "of 1,966 delegates [to the 17th Congress] with either voting or advisory rights, 1,108 persons were arrested on charges of anti-revolutionary crimes, i.e., decidedly more than a majority."
At the congress Rabkrin was dissolved and its functions passed to the Sovnarkom's People's Control Commission.
By the Decree of the Council of Labor and Defense of December 11, 1933, the Directorate of Road Construction of Eastern Siberia and the Far East (Daldorstroy) was created in the city of Khabarovsk, with the task of constructing strategic highways according to the list of the government of the USSR, in the regions of Eastern Siberia and the Soviet Far East. The construction plans were announced at the 17th Congress, held in Moscow from January-February 1934, when the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet Union was adopted. In accordance with it, it was planned to build a Vladivostok-Khabarovsk highway, with a hard (gravel) surface, 600 kilometers long.
