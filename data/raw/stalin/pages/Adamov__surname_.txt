Adamov (Russian: Ада́мов; masculine) or Adamova (Ада́мова; feminine) is a Slavic surname.
There are two theories as to the origins of this last name. According to the most commonly accepted one, they derive from various forms of the Christian masculine given name Adam, which was common in the Ukrainian and Belarusian languages.
Another theory postulates that at least some of these surnames derive from the nicknames which trace their roots to the dialectal word "адам" (adam), meaning a very tall man.
