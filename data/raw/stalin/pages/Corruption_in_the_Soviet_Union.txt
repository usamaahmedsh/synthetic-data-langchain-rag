Corruption in the Soviet Union and Soviet Russia was observed since the early days of the Soviet Russia and until the last days of the Soviet Union. Corruption happened at all levels of positions of power, including political corruption.


== History ==


=== Early years ===
Already on May 2, 1918, Moscow Revtribunal heard the case of four members of the Investigative Committee accused of bribery and blackmailing. On May 8, 1918, the "Decree on Bribery" was signed by Lenin, which punished both givers and takers of bribes.
In February 1920, a special commission, Rabkrin (People's Commissariat of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection) was set to combat two major plagues, inefficiency and corruption at all levels of administration.


=== Brezhnev and later ===

Corruption had grown considerably during Brezhnev's tenure, and became a major problem to the Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s. When Andropov came to power, he initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign.

=== Gorbachev era ===
Brezhnev's family, Yuri Brezhnev, Galina Brezhneva and Yuri Churbanov, were investigated for corruption during Mikhail Gorbachev's administration. Churbanov was sentenced to twelve years in prison on charges of large-scale embezzlement and corruption in the context of the Uzbek cotton scandal. By December 1988, Churbanov had been stripped of all state honours, and sent to a labour camp. Galina, along with the rest of Brezhnev's family, lost all their state privileges.
