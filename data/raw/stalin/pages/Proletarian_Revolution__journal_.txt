Proletarian Revolution (Russian: Пролетарская революция) was a Soviet historical journal published in Moscow from 1921 to 1941. In a review of the first issue, Ilya Vardin reported the journal as declaring "Our goal is precisely to help the writing of the history of the proletarian revolution in Russia. Nobody will read documentary raw materials, except the historians themselves, and we need books that would be read by both workers and students."

From 1921 to 1928 it was published by Istpart, the History of the Party Department, a commission originally founded by the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).

In turn, this letter was also published in the journal.
