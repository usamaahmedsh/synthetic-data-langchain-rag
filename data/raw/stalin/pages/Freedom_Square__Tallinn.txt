Freedom Square (Estonian: Vabaduse väljak) is a public square in central Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia. It is the venue for several state functions as well as concerts. It is located just outside the southern boundary of medieval Tallinn Old Town. Significant landmarks in the square include the St. John's Church (built 1862–1867) and the Victory Column (2009) commemorating the 1918–1920 Estonian War of Independence.

== History ==
The square arose on the site of the Swedish bastion in front of the Harju Gate, which was demolished in the middle of the 19th century. In 1867, the construction of St. John's Church was completed. In 1910, the hay market was discontinued, and the square was paved with stones. In 1910, on the 200th anniversary of the capture of the city by the Tsardom of Russia, a monument to  Tsar Peter I of Russia was erected in the square. After Estonia became an independent country in 1918, the monument to Peter I was dismantled in 1922.
In 1935, the area of the square was expanded. The boulevards were relocated and almost 2,500 square meters of new space was built under the square.
During World War II, after the 1940 Soviet invasion and occupation of Estonia, the new Stalinist regime renamed the square to Victory Square (Võidu väljak) in April 1941. In the autumn of 1941, after Estonia had been occupied by Nazi Germany, the name of Freedom Square was restored. After the Soviet army had reconquered Estonia in 1944, the name was reverted to Victory Square. 
The square has been called Freedom Square again after Estonia restored independence in 1991. The Cross of Liberty and the Monument to the War of Independence was opened on 23 June 2009 as a memorial for those who fell during the Estonian War of Independence.
