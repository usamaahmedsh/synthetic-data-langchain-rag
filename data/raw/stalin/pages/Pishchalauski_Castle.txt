The Minsk Detention Center No. 1 or SIZO No. 1 (Russian: СИЗО №1, Belarusian: СІЗА №1), informally known as Volodarka, Belarusian pronunciation: Valadarka (Валадарка), is the central prison of the Republic of Belarus located in Minsk.


== Name ==
The prison castle is known in Belarusian as Pishchalauski Castle (Пішчалаўскі замак), also spelled Pischalauski Castle, a name derived from the landlord who built it, Rudolph Pischallo. The Russian version of the name is Pishchalovsky castle.
Its popular name, Volodarka, was coined after the October Revolution, when the street on which the building stood was renamed in honour of revolutionary leader V. Volodarsky. It is also sometimes called the Belarusian Bastille.


== Current usage ==
Operated by the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, SIZO No. 1 is the only facility that houses death row inmates. Their execution occurs at the prison.
The prison is also used as a pre-trial detention centre where arrested political activists are held.


== History ==


=== Russian Empire ===
The stone building was completed by 1824, and it was commissioned in spring 1825. The castle-shaped structure was purposely built as a prison by the landowner Rudolph Pischallo (also spelled Rudolf Pischalo), who entrusted architect Kazimir Khrschonovich (also spelled Casimir Hrschanovicha) with the design. The project was approved by Tsar Nicholas I himself. The main building is three stories high, flanked by four corner towers, and surrounded by the prison yard.
