ʿAbbās (Arabic: عَبَّاس) is an old Arabic name that means "Lion". The name traces back to Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib in 536 CE (an uncle of Muhammad) and Abbas ibn Ali, a son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, who participated in the battle of Karbala alongside his brother Husayn ibn Ali. Abbas ibn Ali is revered by Muslims, some of whom are named Abbas in remembrance and tribute to him. There is an Arabian tribe of the same name, the Banu Abbas.
The word 'Abbas' is also used as part of a place name (for example, the English villages of Compton Abbas and Milton Abbas). The name usually relates to land previously owned by an abbess (the head of an abbey of nuns).
Notable people with the name include:
