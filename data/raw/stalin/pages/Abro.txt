Abro, Abra, or Abda (Sindhi: ابڙو) is a Sindhi surname. It is a sub-clan of the larger Samma tribe that at present chiefly occupies the region of Sindh in Pakistan.
The Abro tribe is an influential community residing in Sindh, Balochistan (in Kacchi Plains, Detha or Detho title of some clans in Jakhro or Jakhra are in majority), and Kutch. Historically, they trace their origins to the Samma Rajputs. The tribe is known for producing notable leaders, warriors, and tribal chiefs. Jam Abro Arbhang, remembered for defending Soomra women from Alauddin Khilji's forces, stands out as a historical hero. The Abros have contributed to Sindh's cultural heritage, with their stories celebrated in folklore and Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai's poetry. Today, they maintain their tribal identity while adapting to modern social dynamics.
