Gazanfar Mahmud oghlu Musabeyov or Musabekov (Azerbaijani: غضنفر محمود اوغلی موسی‌بگوف, Qəzənfər Mahmud oğlu Musabəyov, 26 July [O.S. 14 July] 1888 – 9 February 1938) was an Azerbaijani Bolshevik revolutionary and Soviet politician. He was Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Azerbaijan SSR from 1929 to 1931, and he headed the government of the Transcaucasian SFSR from 1931 to 1936. During the Great Purge, Musabekov was arrested (June 1937), accused of plotting against the Soviet state, sentenced to death and executed by a firing squad on 9 February 1938, after his mother. His sister Ayna Sultanova and brother-in-law Hamid Sultanov, both high ranking Azerbaijani Bolshevik revolutionaries and politicians, were also executed in 1938.

An Azerbaijani cargo ship is named after him.
