Ingrid Rüütel was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, as a daughter of socialist politician Neeme Ruus (1911–1942) and actress Linda Karin Ruus (née Aruküll). During World War II, immediately after the 1940 Soviet invasion and occupation of Estonia, during the pro-Soviet coup d'état on 21 June 1940, the authorities in Kremlin promoted then member of Estonian parliament Neeme Ruus to the position of Minister of Social Affairs in the new Stalinist puppet government. After the Nazi German invasion in 1941, Neeme Ruus went into hiding in Estonia. He was subsequently arrested by German occupation authorities, tried and executed in 1942.
