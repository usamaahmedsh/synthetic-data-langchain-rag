The New Leader (1924–2010) was an American political and cultural magazine.


== History ==

The New Leader began in 1924 under a group of figures associated with the Socialist Party of America, such as Eugene V. Debs and Norman Thomas. It was published in New York City by the American Labor Conference on International Affairs. Its orientation was liberal and anti-communist. The Tamiment Institute was its primary supporter.

In its second decade, the magazine's overall politics shifted:Under [Samuel "Sol"] Levitas's editorship, during years when the much-higher-circulation Nation and New Republic often ran acrobatic apologies for Stalin, The New Leader became a bi-weekly platform for what was then known as liberal anti-Communism.

Longtime Editor Myron Kolatch conducted an interview with Columbia University's The Current in 2007. He discussed the history of journals of ideas (The New Leader, Partisan Review, The New Republic, National Review) and their role in politics and intellectual discourse. Kolatch's "Who We Are and Where We Came From", adapted from the last print issue, covers some of the same topics.
