Zviahel Raion (Ukrainian: Звягельський район) is a raion (district) of Zhytomyr Oblast, northern Ukraine. Until 2022, it was known as Novohrad-Volynskyi Raion (Ukrainian: Новоград-Волинський район). Its administrative centre is located at Zviahel, Ukraine. The raion covers an area of 5,242.6 square kilometres (2,024.2 sq mi). Population: 164,972 (2022 estimate).


== History ==
The raion was originally created in 1923 as Novohrad-Volynskyi Raion, within the Volhynian Governorate of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1932, it was reassigned to Kyiv Oblast. In 1935, the raion was abolished.
During World War II, the raion's former territory was occupied by Nazi Germany from July 1941 to January 1944. Soviet partisans fought back against the occupation, and the Nazis burned down several villages.
In 1958, Novohrad-Volynskyi Raion was restored as part of Zhytomyr Oblast. Its boundaries were repeatedly changed until 1966, at which point they stayed the same for a long time.
On 18 July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, the number of raions of Zhytomyr Oblast was reduced to four, and the area of Novohrad-Volynskyi Raion was significantly expanded.  Before the expansion, the area of the raion was 865.2 square kilometres (334.1 sq mi). The January 2020 estimate of the raion population was 43,789 (2020 est.).
The Ukrainian parliament renamed the raion Zviahel Raion, simultaneously approving the renaming of the city Zviahel, on 16 November 2022.
