== Work ==


=== Studies on Leonardo da Vinci I, 1986 ===
In his 1986 book "Studies on Leonardo da Vinci I: Linear Perspective and the Visual Dimensions of Science and Art," Veltman gave a new evaluation of the work of Leonardo da Vinci by focusing upon "Leonardo's visual as opposed to his verbal statements."


=== Virtual Maastricht McLuhan Institute ===
The Virtual Maastricht McLuhan Institute (VMMI) is an institute for new media, named after Marshall McLuhan. The institute was founded in 1998 as Maastricht McLuhan Institute, and renamed to 2004.
The institute explores the "historical effects of new media on the trivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric) and the quadrivium (geometry, astronomy, arithmetic and music) - or the arts and sciences - and implications for those effects on knowledge and culture then and today. VMMI proposes to continue these explorations, with a new focus: Knowledge Organization and Cultural Computing."
