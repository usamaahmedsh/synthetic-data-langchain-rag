Prayer Book of Queen Bona, or the Book of Hours of Queen Bona, is an illuminated manuscript of the book of hours, created in the 1520s by the Polish Renaissance painter and illuminator Stanisław Samostrzelnik and his collaborators. The manuscript was intended for Queen Bona of the Sforza family – the second wife of Sigismund I the Old.
The codex, measuring 143×114 mm and consisting of 271 parchment leaves (including three additional ones), contains the text of the Book of Hours written in Latin in a single column, as well as a concluding prayer in Italian. The signed and dated decoration includes 15 full-page miniatures, borders, and ornamental initials. Since 1834, the manuscript has been part of the Bodleian Library collection in Oxford (catalogue number Douce 40/21 614).
The miniature decoration of Book of Hours of Queen Bona, representing the pinnacle of Samostrzelnik's artistic achievements, is considered one of the most valuable monuments of Polish Renaissance painting.


== Time and circumstances of creation ==
The manuscript was created in the 1520s. A significant date for determining the time of the text's creation is 1521, the year of Pope Leo X's death. His name is mentioned in the form of the initial L on one of the manuscript's leaves, in a prayer for the pope (fol. 144r). The date inscribed in Roman numerals A° MDXXVII, visible on one of the miniatures (fol. 36v), is crucial for establishing the time of the manuscript's decoration. The dating of Book of Hours of Queen Bona is thus confined to the period between about 1521 and 1527, with a possible extension of the completion of the paintings to 1528.
The person for whom the manuscript was intended is clearly identified by the heraldic decoration present on 12 leaves of the manuscript – the family coats of arms of the Sforza, Visconti, and Neapolitan Aragon (the Trastámara cadet line) families, as well as the state emblems of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (the White Eagle) and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Pahonia). In addition, Queen Bona's personal motto Cetera parvi and her initials S B R P (Latin: Serenissima Bona Regina Poloniae) are present, along with the name Bona mentioned in one of the prayers. It is likely that the book of hours was commissioned by Sigismund I the Old as a gift for his wife.


== Content layout of the manuscript ==
The manuscript, intended for Queen Bona's private use, belongs to the type of livres d'heures (horaria) common in Western Europe, popularly known as books of hours, which contain prayers to the Mother of God and the saints.
However, the prayer book includes texts that differ significantly from the program of typical books of hours. Among the texts of different origins are the Marian litany, an extended service against enemies, and prayers for protection against the plague, which also contain elements typical of spells, particularly the personalized prayer in Italian Signor Dio Misericordioso with Queen Bona's name.
The manuscript, made in Poland, is largely modeled on the text of a 15th-century prayer book (Book of Hours of Queen Bona) that the queen brought from Bari, although there are some differences between them.

The lettering styles used in the Book of Hours of Queen Bona align with Renaissance aesthetics. The text was written in a humanistic minuscule (littera antiqua tonda), combined in the titles of individual sections of the prayer book with Roman square capitals. The text, created around 1521, was supplemented a few years later with illuminations painted on parchment of a different thickness than that used for the written pages.


== Miniature decoration ==
The iconographic program of the miniatures differs significantly from Queen Bona's Italian book of hours and is more closely related to other prayer books created by Stanisław Samostrzelnik, especially those intended for chancellors Krzysztof Szydłowiecki and Albertas Goštautas. The miniature decoration, signed and dated on three folios (fol. 36v, 74v, and 229v), represents an orthodox Catholic model of piety with anti-Reformation accents, similar to the Prayer Book of Sigismund the Old, completed in 1524.
The miniatures were created by multiple artists, which was a common practice for manuscript decoration commissions at the time. The individual illuminators working with Samostrzelnik varied in technical skill and color use. However, some illuminations stand out due to a unique painting technique, described by researchers as "painterly". These miniatures, which also bear the signature S.C. (Stanislaus Claratumbensis), are attributed entirely to Brother Stanisław Samostrzelnik of Mogiła. To achieve visual unity in the Book of Hours of Queen Bona, similar compositional schemes and recurring motifs were introduced.
The color scheme of the miniatures from Samostrzelnik's workshop is vivid and limited to a few primary colors, sometimes lightened. The dominant hues in the palette include shades of blue (ultramarine, cornflower, turquoise), sea green, and olive, as well as pinks appearing alongside alizarin red, carmine, vermilion, and orange. Complementary shades include ashy and violet grays, tawny and dark browns, and white, with yellow used sparingly. Luminescent effects were achieved by combining pigments with powdered gold. This painterly gold was used not only in marginal decorations but also in the main parts of the illuminations, allowing for color harmonization, spatial depth, and a shimmering, radiant surface.
The illuminations in the Prayer Book of Queen Bona reveal influences not only from the woodcuts of Hans von Kulmbach, Albrecht Dürer, and Albrecht Altdorfer – particularly from the Fall and Redemption of Mankind cycle – but also from the paintings of the Danube school. The modifications introduced by Samostrzelnik when copying and reinterpreting other artists' works softened the dramatic nature of the original scenes, giving the miniatures a lyrical quality with elements of fairy-tale wonder and splendor.
Among the prayer books created by the artist, the Book of Hours of Queen Bona stands out for its strong influence of Italian Renaissance ornamentation in the decoration of the borders. This includes Venetian-style arabesques and a clear arrangement of motifs such as candelabras, vases, medallions, laurel wreaths, putti with cornucopias, and dolphins.


== Provenance ==
The prayer book was likely taken by Queen Bona to Bari in 1556. The manuscript's fate remains unknown until the early 19th century when it was part of the collection of the English bibliophile and antiquarian Francis Douce. After his death in 1834, Queen Bona's prayer book became part of the Bodleian Library's holdings as part of the collector's estate.


== Book edition ==
A facsimile edition of the prayer book was published in 2016 by Wydawnictwo Poznańskie Studia Polonistyczne as part of the Libri Precationum Illuminati Poloniae Veteris series. At the Kraków Book Fair, the series received an award in the "Edycja" competition for editorial excellence.
