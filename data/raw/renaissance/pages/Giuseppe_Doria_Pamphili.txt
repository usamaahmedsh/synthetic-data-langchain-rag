He had an epistular exchange with Benjamin Franklin. In some of those letters, Franklin declared his availability to accept a French priest, chosen by the Papacy, to be sent in America in order to manage all the spiritual affairs pertaining the Roman Catholics who wish to establish themselves within the United States.
