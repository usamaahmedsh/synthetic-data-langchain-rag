Johannes Mangon (c. 1525 in Liège – 1578 in Aachen) was a Francophone composer from the Spanish Netherlands. He was selected while a boy in Liége to join the choir at the Cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle, that is to say Aachen in modern Germany. He rose to become maître de chapelle. Among his surviving works are 20 masses and over 100 motets, hymns etc, contained in 3 large choirbooks he copied for Aachen Cathedral which are still preserved there. He died of the plague in 1578 and was succeeded by Lambertus de Monte (Liége, d.1606) and then Michael Wilhelm (fl. 1580–1610).
