The Glasgow Fechtbuch (MS E.1939.65.341  in the R. L. Scott Collection of the Glasgow Museums in Glasgow, Scotland) is a combat manual of the German school of fencing, dated to 1505.
Consisting of 105 folia, it combines the instructions of various masters of the 15th century who stood in the tradition of Johannes Liechtenauer, presumably based on a previous compilation made by fencing master Sigmund Schining ein Ringeck.
