Tillyhilt Castle was a 16th-century tower house 6.5 miles (10.5 km) west of Ellon, 1 mile (1.6 km) northwest of Tarves, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.


== History ==
The Gordons owned the castle. John Gordon acquired the land in 1575, and it is thought the castle was built after this.


== Structure ==
Only 9.0 metres (29.5 ft) of the west wall, to a maximum height of 0.7 metres (2 ft 4 in) remains, along with a turf-covered mound of rubble about 10.0 miles (16.1 km) wide and about 1.0 metre (3 ft 3 in) high just to its east.  There was earlier evidence of two towers.  It is thought the building was not more than 30 feet (9.1 m) long.
