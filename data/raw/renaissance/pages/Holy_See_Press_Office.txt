The Holy See Press Office (Latin: Sala Stampa Sanctae Sedis; Italian: Sala Stampa della Santa Sede) is the press office of the Holy See. It publishes the official news of the activities of the Pope and of the various departments of the Roman Curia. All speeches, messages and documents, as well as the statements issued by the Director, are published in their entirety.
The press office is located outside Vatican City, in Via della Conciliazione.

The press office operates every day in Italian, although texts in other languages are also available.
On 27 June 2015, Pope Francis, through an apostolic letter issued motu proprio ("on his own initiative"), established the Secretariat for Communication in the Roman Curia. The Press Office was incorporated into it, but at the same time belongs to the Secretariat of State. On 21 December 2015, Pope Francis appointed Dr. Greg Burke, formerly the Communications Advisor for the Section for General Affairs of the Vatican's Secretariat of State (a key department in the Roman Curia), as Deputy Director of the Press Office.
Following Burke's appointment as director in 2016, Spanish journalist Paloma García Ovejero took over as vice director, making her the first woman to hold that position. It was also announced that both Burke and García Ovejero, both laymen, would later begin their positions on 1 August 2016. On 31 December 2018, both Burke and García Ovejero announced their resignations. Pope Francis has therefore appointed Italian journalist Alessandro Gisotti, former deputy editor-in-chief of Vatican Radio, as interim director of the Holy See Press Office.
In July 2019, Pope Francis named British-born Italian layman Matteo Bruni as Director. Bruni is the first non-journalist to serve in this position. The same month, the Pope appointed Brazilian laywoman Cristiane Murray, who previously served as the Vatican Radio commentator for papal events and international trips for 25 years, as Vice Director.
