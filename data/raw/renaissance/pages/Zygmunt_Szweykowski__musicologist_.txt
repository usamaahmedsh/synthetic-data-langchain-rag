Zygmunt Marian Szweykowski (12 May 1929 – 3 August 2023) was a Polish musicologist and academic. Described as "one of the leading Polish musicologists of his generation", Szweykowski specialized in Renaissance and Baroque music, particularly that of Poland and Italy. His career was primarily spent at Jagiellonian University and he was closely associated with the PWM Edition publisher.


== Life and career ==
Zygmunt Marian Szweykowski was born in Kraków, the Second Polish Republic, on 12 May 1929. He was the son of Zygmunt Szweykowski, a literary historian, and Antonina Szweykowski, née Janiszewska. Szweykowski lived in Warsaw during World War II, following which he moved to Częstochowa. He studied musicology under Adolf Chybiński at the University of Poznań, graduating in 1951. He obtained his doctoral degree under Józef Michał Chomiński at Jagiellonian University, Kraków, in 1964; his dissertation was on the "concertato technique" of Baroque Polish music.
After working as Chybiński's assistant in Poznań from 1950 to 1953, Szweykowski returned to Kraków as editor of the PWM Edition music publisher from 1954 to 1961. Simultaneously he was an assistant at Jagiellonian University from 1954 to 1963, and then assistant professor there from 1964 to 1970. Initially from the insistence of musicologist Stefania Łobaczewska, Szweykowski gradually achieved higher positions at Jagiellonian University: assistant (1954–1963); assistant professor (1964–1970); musicology department head (from 1970); reader (1971–1989); a habilitation degree (1987); and full professor (from 1990). Szweykowski died on 3 August 2023 in Kraków, at the age of 94.
The musicologist Mirosław Perz described as Szweykowski "one of the leading Polish musicologists of his generation". Szweykowski specialized in the music history of Poland and Italy, particularly Renaissance and Baroque music; Perz notes that he discovered "many unknown Polish compositions and sources concerning Polish musical culture". Among the composers he wrote on were Mikołaj Gomółka, Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki, Marcin Mielczewski, Jan Staromiejski and Wacław of Szamotuły. His "highly regarded" editions of Polish music include numerous anthologies on a variety of old Polish music.
Throughout his career, Szweykowski was a member of numerous music organizations: the Polish Composers' Union (from 1955), the American Musicological Society and the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna (honorary member). His national awards included the Cross of Merit, the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Medal of the National Education Commission.
