The Asloan Manuscript is an anthology of Scots prose and poetry dating to the early sixteenth century. It was compiled by the Edinburgh notary John Asloan.
The manuscript's poetry consists of works by Henryson, Dunbar, Richard Holland and anonymous authors. The prose works consist of historical chronicles and religious and moral texts, often translations of famous works from elsewhere in Europe.
It is held by the National Library of Scotland.
