== History ==
Chemerivtsi was first founded in 1565, and it received the Magdeburg rights in 1797. In 1898, the town had an almost exclusively Jewish population of 1,282.
It received the status of an urban-type settlement in 1959.
Until 18 July 2020, Chemerivtsi was the administrative center of Chemerivtsi Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Khmelnytskyi Oblast to three. The area of Chemerivtsi Raion was merged into Kamianets-Podilskyi Raion.
Until 26 January 2024, Chemerivtsi was designated urban-type settlement. On this day, a new law entered into force which abolished this status, and Chemerivtsi became a rural settlement.
