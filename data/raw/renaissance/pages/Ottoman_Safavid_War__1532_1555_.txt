The Ottoman–Safavid War of 1532–1555 was one of the many military conflicts fought between the two arch rivals, the Ottoman Empire led by Suleiman the Magnificent, and the Safavid Empire led by Tahmasp I. Ottoman territorial gains were confirmed in the Peace of Amasya.


== Background ==
The war was triggered by territorial disputes between the two empires, especially when the Bey of Bitlis decided to put himself under Persian protection. Also, Tahmasp had the governor of Baghdad, a sympathiser of Suleiman, assassinated. Additionally, the Safavid governor of Azerbaijan, Ulameh Soltan, defected to the Ottomans and informed them of the ongoing struggles of the Persians with the Uzbeks as well as with various other tribes.
On the diplomatic front, the Safavids had been engaged in discussions with the Habsburgs for the formation of a Habsburg–Persian alliance that would attack the Ottoman Empire on two fronts.


== Two Iraqi Expedition (1532–1534) ==
Ottoman incursions begun as early in 1532. Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha successfully attacked Safavid Iraq, recaptured Bitlis, and proceeded to capture Tabriz on 15 July 1534. There, he was joined by Suleiman himself, and then captured Baghdad in December 1534. Tahmasp, who at the beginning had been on a campaign against the Uzbeks in the east, hurried his armies west but did not force a major confrontation, adopting a strategy of harassing Ottoman supply trains and scorched earth.


== Second Ottoman campaign (1548–1549) ==
Under the Grand Vizier Rüstem Pasha, Ottomans  attempting to defeat the Shah once and for all, Suleiman embarked upon a second campaign in 1548–1549. This time, he was aided by Alqas Mirza, Tahmasp's half-brother, who had defected and was given a force of 40,000 cavalry to invade Persia. Again, Tahmasp adopted a scorched earth policy, laying waste to Armenia.
Meanwhile, the French king Francis I, enemy of the Habsburgs, and Suleiman the Magnificent were moving forward in a Franco-Ottoman alliance, formalized in 1536, that would counterbalance the Habsburg threat. In 1547, when Suleiman attacked Persia, France sent its ambassador Gabriel de Luetz, to accompany him in his campaign. Gabriel de Luetz gave military advice to Suleiman, as when he advised on artillery placement during the Siege of Van. At the same time, Portuguese forces helped the Persians to win a battle near the Euphrates against the Ottomans with a certain number of troops and twenty cannons.
Suleiman made gains in Tabriz, Persian ruled Armenia, secured a lasting presence in the province of Van in Eastern Anatolia, and took some forts in Georgia.


== Third Ottoman campaign (1553–1555) and aftermath ==

In 1553 the Ottomans, first under the Grand Vizier Rüstem Pasha, and later joined by Suleiman himself, began his third and final campaign against the Shah. Prior to that, Ismail Mirza Safavi, Tahmasp's second son, had successfully invaded eastern Anatolia, defeated the governor of Erzerum and captured the town as well as Akhlar and Arjish. Suleiman then advanced as far as Karabagh in the southern Caucasus, but again no set-piece battle took place and he only collected plunder. Nevertheless, with both sides exhausted by the war, the Peace of Amasya was signed on 29 May 1555. Suleiman returned Tabriz, but kept Baghdad, lower Mesopotamia, western Armenia, western Georgia, the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris, and part of the Persian Gulf coast. Persia retained the rest of all its northwestern territories in the Caucasus.
Due to his heavy commitment in Persia, Suleiman was only able to send limited naval support to France in the Franco-Ottoman invasion of Corsica (1553).
