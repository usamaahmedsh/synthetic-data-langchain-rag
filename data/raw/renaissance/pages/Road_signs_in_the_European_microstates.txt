Road signs in the European microstates Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City (the Holy See) generally conform to the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. They largely follow the general European conventions concerning the use of shape and color to indicate their function as well as in most European countries. Out of all the European microstates, only San Marino and the Holy See have signed the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, both of which are entirely surrounded by Italy.
