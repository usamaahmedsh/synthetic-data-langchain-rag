The Eparchy of Lutsk–Ostroh (also known as "Lutsk–Ostroh of the Ukrainians" and in Latin as  "Luceorien(sis) et Ostrogien(sis) Ruthenorum") was an eparchy in the Ruthenian Uniate Church (1594-1636, 1702-1795 and 1789-1839). It was a suffragan eparchy (equivalent to a diocese in the Latin Rite) of the Metropolis of Kiev, Galicia and all Ruthenia. It was situated in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Today, the territory of the eparchy is located in the north-western part of the modern state of Ukraine; it encompassed the oblasts (provinces) of Volyn Oblast and Rivne Oblast. From 1921 to 1973, the eparchy was a titular see of the Eastern Catholic Church.
Remarkably, its Latin title always called it 'Ruthenian', which is now a distinct Byzantine rite Eastern Catholic (then 'Uniate') particular church sui iuris. 
In the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church — the successor to the Ruthenian Unite Church, the current exarchate of Lutsk may be considered to be the successor of the eparchy. As an exarchate, it only has a pre-diocesan rank. It was erected in 2008 on territory split from the metropolitan Major Archeparchy of Kyiv–Galicia.


== History ==
The see joined the Union of Brest on 2 February 1594. It did not have a Latin precursor.
It was suppressed in 1636 by King of Poland Władysław IV Vasa and the eparchy was 'returned' to the Orthodox community. As a result, the remaining Uniate parishes and several monasteries were administered by the Archimandrite of the Zhydychyn Saint Nicholas's Monastery.
It was restored in 1702.
It was again suppressed again in 1795, without a direct Catholic successor.
It was again restored on 18 November 1798.
It was suppressed for the final time on 14 March 1839 without a direct Catholic successor.
