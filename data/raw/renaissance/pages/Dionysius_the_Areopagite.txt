Dionysius the Areopagite (; Ancient Greek: Διονύσιος ὁ Ἀρεοπαγίτης Dionysios ho Areopagitēs) was an Athenian judge at the Areopagus Court in Athens, who lived in the first century. A convert to Christianity, he is venerated as a saint by multiple denominations.


== Life ==

As related in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 17:34), he was converted to Christianity by the preaching of Paul the Apostle, being first stirred to Christian doctrine by Paul's sermon at the Areopagus: 

Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
After his conversion, Dionysius became the first Bishop of Athens, though he is sometimes counted as the second after Hierotheus. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches. He is the patron saint of Athens and is venerated as the protector of judges and the judiciary. His memory is celebrated on October 3.


== Historic controversy ==
By the early-sixth century, the Corpus Dionysiacum, a collection of four philosophical-theological treatises that "adapted and transformed" Neoplatonic categories into Christian mystical thought, was being explicitly used and attributed to the first-century Areopagite "by just about all parties in the Christian east" (Chalcedonians, Miaphysites, and Nestorians). The historical origins of the documents and identity of the author are somewhat unclear before this period and have therefore been subjected to extensive historical and literary scrutiny.
Most scholars adopt a critical view of the writer as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. Debate within Dionysian scholarship typically presupposes inauthenticity and explores possible motives for the fictional attribution—whether as an act of honorific memorialization or strategic deception. The principal argument concerns the writer’s dependence on the language and thought of the fifth-century philosopher Proclus, first demonstrated in articles by Hugo Koch and Joseph Stiglmayr at the turn of the twentieth century. This position has become so widely accepted that a terminus post quem for the corpus is commonly set at Proclus’ death in 485. Additional evidence cited against authenticity includes a lack of early testimony; the earliest historical mentions since the initial objections having mildly shifted from Pope Gregory I in the late sixth century to Severus of Antioch in the early sixth century. Further grounds for doubt include anachronistic sacramentology, Christology, and liturgiology—notably, implausibly early references to church buildings and Dormition traditions, along with prematurely articulated doctrines of the hypostatic union.
Some modern scholars, including recent contributor Evangelos Nikitopoulos, Romanian professor Dumitru Stăniloae, and English translator John Parker, argue in favor of a traditional composition date in the late first to early second century. Their case draws upon harmonizations with alleged anachronisms, contemporary lexical parallels and idiosyncrasies, and internal literary and historical consistency. Most significant are the pre-Proclean references to the corpus by figures such as John Chrysostom and Juvenal of Jerusalem, and especially by members of the Alexandrian tradition—Pantaenus, Origen, Gregory Nazianzus, and Jerome—who demonstrate familiarity with the Corpus Dionysiacum. Even Proclus himself, who admitted to "summariz[ing] the observations rightly made... by some of our predecessors" such as Origen, appears to cite an external source for the euphemism "flowers and supersubstantial lights"—a phrase explicitly found only in Dionysius. Linguistic analyses further suggest that nearly two-thirds of Dionysius' terminology lacks precedent in any known pre-sixth-century Christian or Neoplatonic text, while another quarter can be traced to ante-Nicene philosophical sources such as Platonic dialogues. Nikitopoulos argues that this primitive theological vocabulary aligns with the intellectual profile reconstructed for another second-century Eastern convert with a pagan Greek education: Justin Martyr.
Scholia addressing the authenticity of the Corpus Dionysiacum began as early as the late sixth century, with positive reception by John of Scythopolis and Maximus the Confessor. On the conciliar stage, the Fathers of the Council of Chalcedon (451), Lateran (649), Constantinople III (680–681), and Nicaea II (787) all cited Dionysius as an apostolic authority, invoking his writings in support of Mariology, Christology, and Iconography. Throughout the Middle Ages, the corpus remained deeply influential in both East and West, with figures such as John of Damascus, Hilduin of Paris, Photius of Constantinople, and Hugh of Saint Victor regularly appealing to Dionysius as a source of theological and mystical insight. The Areopagite ranked among the most frequently cited Patristic authorities by eminent theologians Thomas Aquinas and Gregory Palamas. Apart from minor debates alluded to by Maximus and Photius, the corpus enjoyed virtually uncontested acceptance throughout the first and early second millennium. This stability was only disrupted in the fifteenth century, when Renaissance humanists Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus, along with Reformer Martin Luther, mounted the first major challenges to its authenticity, ultimately leading to the prevailing modern academic consensus of pseudonymity by the late-nineteenth century.
Hilduin’s ninth-century Passio S. Dionysii mistakenly identified Dionysius with the martyred third-century bishop Dionysius of Paris, a conflation generally rejected by contemporary readers and universally dismissed by modern scholars.

In Athens there are two large churches bearing his name, one in Kolonaki on Skoufa Street, while the other is the Catholic Metropolis of Athens, on Panepistimiou Street. The pedestrian walkway around the Acropolis, which passes through the rock of the Areios Pagos, also bears his name.
Dionysius is the patron saint of the Gargaliani of Messenia, as well as in the village of Dionysi in the south of the prefecture of Heraklion. The village was named after him and is the only village of Crete with a church in honor of Saint Dionysios Areopagitis.
