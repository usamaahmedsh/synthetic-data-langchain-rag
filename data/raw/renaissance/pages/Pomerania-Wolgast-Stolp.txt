The Duchy of Wolgast-Stolp, also known as the Duchy of Wolgast and Stolp, and the Duchy of Wołogoszcz and Słupsk, was a feudal duchy in Western Pomerania within the Holy Roman Empire. Its capital was Wolgast. It was ruled by the Griffin dynasty. It existed in the eras of Late Middle Ages and the Early modern period, from 1532 to 1625.
The state was formed on 21 November 1532, in the partition of the Duchy of Pomerania, with duke Philip I, as its first ruler. It existed until 1625, when, under the rule of duke Bogislaw XIV, it was incorporated into the unified Duchy of Pomerania.
