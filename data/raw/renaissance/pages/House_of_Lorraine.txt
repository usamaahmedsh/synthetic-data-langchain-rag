The House of Lorraine (German: Haus Lothringen) originated as a cadet branch of the House of Metz. It inherited the Duchy of Lorraine in 1473 after the death without a male heir of Nicholas I, Duke of Lorraine. By the marriage of Francis of Lorraine to Maria Theresa of Austria in 1736, and with the success in the ensuing War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), the House of Lorraine was joined to the House of Habsburg and became known as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine (German: Haus Habsburg-Lothringen). Francis, his sons Joseph II and Leopold II, and his grandson Francis II were the last four Holy Roman emperors from 1745 until the dissolution of the empire in 1806. The House of Habsburg-Lorraine inherited the Habsburg Empire, ruling the Austrian Empire and then Austria-Hungary until the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918.
Although its senior agnates are the dukes of Hohenberg, the house is currently headed by Karl von Habsburg (born 1961), grandson of the last emperor Charles I.


== Ancestry ==


=== A controversial origin ===
The main two theories of the House's origin are:

the theory of Etichonid ancestry, which claims that Adalbert of Metz and his brother Gerard were descendants of the Nordgau branch of the Etichonid Dynasty, the same branch from which the House of Habsburg and the House of Zähringen could possibly descend;
the theory of Gerardide ancestry, which claims that Adalbert and Gerard descended from the Matfridings which are thought to have been a branch of the Gerardides.
What is more securely demonstrated is that in 1048 Emperor Henry III gave the Duchy of Upper Lorraine first to Adalbert of Metz and then to his brother Gerard whose successors (collectively known as the House of Alsace or the House of Châtenois) retained the duchy until the death of Charles the Bold in 1431.


==== Certainties ====
Based on documents dating from the 11th century, researchers are able to establish the two generations preceding Gerard of Alsace. The oldest certain generation is a sibling group shown at the top of the family chart below composed of Gerard, Adalbert and Adelaide · :

Gerard, Count, probably of Metz, died between 1021 and 1033, married Eve, daughter of Count Sigefroid, ancestor of the Counts of Luxembourg. From this marriage were born two children: Sigfried, died between 1017 and 1020, and Berscinde, abbess of Remiremont;
Adelaide married Henry of Franconia, Count in Wormsgau, and is the mother of Emperor Conrad II the Salic and several other children;
Adalbert was Count of Metz, died in 1037. A donation dated June 12, 1037 in favor of the Abbey of Saint-Mathieu calls him dux and marchio Lotoringie. He married Judith who gave birth to a single son, named Gérard · .
Gérard, son of Adalbert, died in 1045. He is called Count of Alsace in a charter of May 1038 where he puts an end to a dispute against the Abbey of Remiremont. He married a Gisèle, who gave birth to Adalbert, Duke of Lorraine in 1047, Gérard, Count of Metz, then Duke of Lorraine in 1047, Conrad, Adalberon, Beatrix, Odelric, Cuno, Oda, abbess of Remiremont from 1048 to 1071, Azelinus, Ida and Adelheid, as stated in the Notitiæ Fundationis Monasterii Bosonis-Villæ (Notice of the founding of the monastery of Bouzonville) · .


==== Etichonid ====
The Etichonid origin was unanimously recognized from the 18th until the 20th century. For this reason, the marriage between Maria Theresa of Austria and Francis of Lorraine was seen at the time as the reunion of the two branches of the dynasty. The main proponents of this theory have been: Dom Calmet (1672 † 1757), Nicolas Viton de Saint-Allais (1773 † 1842) and more recently Michel Dugast Rouillé (1919 † 1987) and Henry Bogdan.


==== Gerardide-Matfriding ====
The main proponents of the Gerardide-Matfriding theory are: Eduard Hlawitschka, George Poull and partially the Europäische Stammtafeln (which however does not take into account the kinship with the Girardides).

The question of the origin of the House of Lorraine was taken up in the 20th Century by Eduard Hlawitschk. He established that Gérard d'Alsace came from the Counts of Metz, but grouped these counts into two family groups: the Matfried of the 9th Century, and the Adalbert/Gérard of the 10th century. The absence of documentation does not allow a formal kinship to be established between the two groups. But he notes that this kinship is very probable because they are of similar status, use the same onomastic background and have concluded matrimonial alliances in the same circles (House of Ardennes, imperial families, etc.).
Eduard Hlawitschka continues his proposal by estimating that the Matfrieds could even be descended from the Gerardide (family of Gérard/Girard, Leuthard, Alard/Adal(h)ard, Beggo/Bégon/Bérenger), counts of Paris at the end of the 8th century and the beginning of the 9th century. His thesis was taken up by the historian George Poull and partially by the Europäische Stammtafeln (which however do not take into account the kinship with the Girardides). Eduard Hlawitschka's thesis, with the Girardide connection, is the one that currently meets with the most support, while the Etichonide thesis seems to be receding (for the agnateic/male lineage, of course; in the cognatic/female lineage, there are obviously relationships, at least with the Eguisheim-Nordgau).


==== Renaissance & Modern ====
The Renaissance dukes of Lorraine tended to arrogate to themselves claims to Carolingian ancestry, as illustrated by Alexandre Dumas, père in the novel La Dame de Monsoreau (1846); in fact, as seen above, the only evidence is of some interraltionships with the Carolingians, and some intermarriages with the Saxon Emperors and the Salian Emperors, but not so much as to give them any claims to the Imperial Crown, much less the Crown of France.  
This did not stop the Bourbons in the Treaty of Montmartre in 1662 naming the non-Capetian House of Lorraine based on this supposed ancestry as next in line to the French throne after the Bourbons, in preference to the Capetian House of Courtenay, who would have been next by the Salic Law.  Based on the terms of the accord, Louis XIV was given control of the Duchy of Lorraine, and Charles IV's family would become princes in the French royal family. However, it failed to take hold and Charles IV publicly repudiated it.
The house of Vaudémont continuted to rule the independent duchies of Lorraine and Bar. However, Louis XIV's imperialist ambitions (which involved the occupation of Lorraine in 1669–97) forced the dukes into a permanent alliance with his archenemies, the Holy Roman Emperors from the House of Habsburg.
The final status of the duchy was only determined as part of the settlement of the War of Austrian Succession.  As part of that, Francis Stephen, now Holy Roman Emperor and husband of Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of Bohemia and Hungary, surrendered the Duchy of Lorraine to France (to be ruled by the former King of Poland, Stanisław Leszczyński, the father in law of Louis XV of France, during his lifetime, and then to be inherited by France.  Francis Stephen and his heirs received the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and all his wife's Habsburg lands (House of Habsburg-Lorraine).


== Houses of Vaudémont and Guise ==

After a brief interlude of 1453–1473, when the duchy passed in right of Charles's daughter to her husband John of Calabria, a Capetian, Lorraine reverted to the House of Vaudémont, a junior branch of House of Lorraine, in the person of René II who later added to his titles that of Duke of Bar.
The French Wars of Religion saw the rise of a junior branch of the Lorraine family, the House of Guise, which became a dominant force in French politics and, during the later years of Henry III's reign, was on the verge of succeeding to the throne of France. Mary of Guise, mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, also came from this family.
Under the Bourbon monarchy the remaining branch of the House of Guise, headed by the duc d'Elbeuf, remained part of the highest ranks of French aristocracy.


== House of Habsburg‑Lorraine ==

After Emperor Joseph I and Emperor Charles VI failed to produce a son and heir, the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 left the throne to the latter's yet unborn daughter, Maria Theresa. In 1736 Emperor Charles arranged her marriage to Francis of Lorraine who agreed to exchange his hereditary lands for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (as well as the Duchy of Teschen from the Emperor).
At Charles's death in 1740 the Habsburg holdings passed to Maria Theresa and Francis, who was later elected (in 1745) Holy Roman Emperor as Francis I. The Habsburg-Lorraine nuptials and dynastic union precipitated, and survived, the War of the Austrian Succession. Francis and Maria Theresa's daughters Marie Antoinette and Maria Carolina of Austria became Queens of France and Naples-Sicily, respectively, while their sons Joseph II and Leopold II succeeded to the imperial title.
Apart from the core Habsburg dominions, including the triple crowns of Austria, Hungary and Bohemia, several junior branches of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine reigned in the Italian duchies of Tuscany (until 1737-1796, 1814-1860), Parma (1814-1847) and Modena (1814-1859). Another member of the house, Archduke Maximilian of Austria, was Emperor of Mexico (1863–67).
In 1900, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria (then heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne) contracted a morganatic marriage with Countess Sophie Chotek. Their descendants, known as the House of Hohenberg, have been excluded from succession to the Austro-Hungarian crown, but not that of Lorraine, where morganatic marriage has never been outlawed. Nevertheless, Otto von Habsburg, the eldest grandson of Franz Ferdinand's younger brother, was universally regarded as the head of the house until his death in 2011. It was at Nancy, the former capital of the House of Vaudémont, that the former crown prince married Princess Regina of Saxe-Meiningen in 1951.
