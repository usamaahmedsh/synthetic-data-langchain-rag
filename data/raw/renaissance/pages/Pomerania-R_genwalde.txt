The Duchy of Pomerania-Rügenwalde, also known as the Duchy of Rügenwalde, and the Duchy of Darłowo, was a feudal duchy in Western Pomerania within the Holy Roman Empire. Its capital was Darłowo. It was ruled by the Griffin dynasty. It existed in the early modern period, from 1569 to 1625.
The state was formed in 1569, from the part of the territory of Pomerania-Stettin, with duke Barnim X, as its first ruler. It existed until 1625, when, under the rule of duke Bogislaw XIV, it was incorporated into the unified Duchy of Pomerania.
