In geometry, a limaçon or limacon [limasɔ̃], also known as a limaçon of Pascal or Pascal's Snail, is defined as a roulette curve formed by the path of a point fixed to a circle when that circle rolls around the outside of a circle of equal radius. It can also be defined as the roulette formed when a circle rolls around a circle with half its radius so that the smaller circle is inside the larger circle. Thus, they belong to the family of curves called centered trochoids; more specifically, they are epitrochoids. The cardioid is the special case in which the point generating the roulette lies on the rolling circle; the resulting curve has a cusp.
Depending on the position of the point generating the curve, it may have inner and outer loops (giving the family its name),  it may be heart-shaped, or it may be oval.
A limaçon is a bicircular rational plane algebraic curve of degree 4.


== History ==
The earliest formal research on limaçons is generally attributed to Étienne Pascal, father of Blaise Pascal. However, some insightful investigations regarding them had been undertaken earlier by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer. Dürer's Underweysung der Messung (Instruction in Measurement) contains specific geometric methods for producing limaçons. The curve was named by Gilles de Roberval when he used it as an example for finding tangent lines, deriving the word from the latin limax: snail.


== Equations ==
The equation (up to translation and rotation) of a limaçon in polar coordinates has the form

  
    
      
        r
        =
        b
        +
        a
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=b+a\cos \theta .}
  

This can be converted to Cartesian coordinates by multiplying by r (thus introducing a point at the origin which in some cases is spurious), and substituting 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            2

    {\displaystyle r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}}

            (

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(x^{2}+y^{2}-ax\right)^{2}=b^{2}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right).}
  

Applying the parametric form of the polar to Cartesian conversion, we also have

while setting

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle z=x+iy=(b+a\cos \theta )(\cos \theta +i\sin \theta )}
  

yields this parameterization as a curve in the complex plane:

  
    
      
        z
        =

    {\displaystyle z=be^{it}+{a \over 2}e^{2it}}
  
,
we would, by changing the location of the origin, convert to the usual form of the equation of a centered trochoid. Note the change of independent variable at this point to make it clear that we are no longer using the default polar coordinate parameterization

making it a member of the rose family of curves. This curve is a trisectrix, and is sometimes called the limaçon trisectrix.


== Form ==
When 
  
    
      
        b
        >
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle b>a}
  
, the limaçon is a simple closed curve. However, the origin satisfies the Cartesian equation given above, so the graph of this equation has an acnode or isolated point.
When 
  
    
      
        b
        >
        2
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle b>2a}
  
, the area bounded by the curve is convex, and when 
  
    
      
        a
        <
        b
        <
        2
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a<b<2a}
  
, the curve has an indentation bounded by two inflection points. At 
  
    
      
        b
        =
        2
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle b=2a}
  
, the point

        −
        a
        ,
        0
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-a,0)}
  
 is a point of 0 curvature.
As 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  
 is decreased relative to 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  
, the indentation becomes more pronounced until, at 
  
    
      
        b
        =
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle b=a}
  
, the curve becomes a cardioid, and the indentation becomes a cusp. For 
  
    
      
        0
        <
        b
        <
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0<b<a}
  
, the cusp expands to an inner loop, and the curve crosses itself at the origin. As 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  
 approaches 0, the loop fills up the outer curve and, in the limit, the limaçon becomes a circle traversed twice.

If the conic is a parabola then the inverse will be a cardioid, if the conic is a hyperbola then the corresponding limaçon will have an inner loop, and if the conic is an ellipse then the corresponding limaçon will have no loop.
The conchoid of a circle with respect to a point on the circle is a limaçon.
A particular special case of a Cartesian oval is a limaçon.
