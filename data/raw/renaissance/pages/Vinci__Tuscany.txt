Vinci (English:  VIN-chee, Italian: [ˈvintʃi]) is a comune of the Metropolitan City of Florence in the Italian region of Tuscany. The birthplace of Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci lies just outside the town.


== Physical geography ==
Vinci is situated on the slopes of Montalbano, a hilly massif rich in vineyards and olive groves, characterized by terraces supported by distinctive dry stone walls.
The oldest part of Vinci has an almond-shaped layout, which is unusual for this area of Tuscany. Viewed from above, it resembles a two-masted boat (with the two masts being the tower of the Rocca dei Conti Guidi and the bell tower of the church of Santa Croce). For this reason, the historic center of Vinci is also known as “Castel della Nave” (Castle of the Ship).
