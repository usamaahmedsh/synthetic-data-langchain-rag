In Extremo (Latin for At the Edge; abbreviated InEx or IE) is a German medieval metal band from Berlin. Their musical style combines heavy metal music with traditional medieval songs and instruments such as bagpipes, harps, hurdy-gurdies, and shawms. Their original songs are mostly written in German, but they also perform traditional songs and covers in a variety of languages.


== History ==

In Extremo began as two separate projects: an unnamed acoustic medieval group and an electronic rock band.  It was founded by Michael Robert "Micha" Rhein (stage name: Das letzte Einhorn; English: "The Last Unicorn") on April 11th, 1995, during the recording for that year's performances.
The original members of the band include Thomas der Münzer ("Thomas the Coiner"; guitar), Der Morgenstern ("The Morning Star"; drums), and Die Lutter ("The Lutter", bass guitar). Most of the band members perform under stage names, such as Das letzte Einhorn (vocals), Flex der Biegsame ("Flex the Flexible"; bagpipes), Dr. Pymonte (bagpipes), Conny Fuchs (left before the official release due to pregnancy; replaced by Dr. Pymonte) and Sen Pusterbalg (replaced shortly after the official release by Yellow Pfeiffer, "Yellow Piper"; bagpipes).  As of 2000, the band's guitarist is Van Lange, replacing Der Münzer. Most members play multiple instruments, often rotating between songs.
In Extremo was encouraged to attempt to start a band combining bagpipes and other traditional instruments with rock guitars in 1994 because of an increasing number of visitors, the success of their CDs, and the popular interest. They were inspired by popular groups, Corvus Corax and Bathory, to transition to being a hybrid rock group.
In August 1996, they began work on the first "In Extremo" album, which already contained two tracks of the new rock project. Because the album had no official name, it became known as Gold due to its golden cover. In February 1997, it quickly sold out in medieval markets.
In Extremo played separately as a medieval band and a rock band until 29 March 1997, when they played their first live rock concert. They typically use this concert as their establishment date. The two projects were officially merged on 11 January 1998. April 1998 saw the first "high occupancy" In Extremo concert in the Rabenstein castle in Brandenburg.
Over the years, the band's music became more heavy metal-based, while at the same time becoming increasingly commercially successful. The classical instruments, however—bagpipes, shawms, and lutes—still play a significant role. The band is likewise noted for their stage costumes and known for using pyrotechnics in their concerts, including Der Morgenstern playing cymbals which have been set on fire.
In February 2010, In Extremo announced that Der Morgenstern had left the band because of musical differences. In June, Florian "Specki T.D." Speckardt was announced as his replacement on drums. Since then, they have proceeded to release five albums: Sterneneisen, Kunstraub, Quid Pro Quo, Kompass zur Sonne, and Wolkenschieber, all of which have reached the top 10 in the German charts, with Sterneneisen, Quid Pro Quo, and Kompass zur Sonne all having number 1 positions for a time.
In July 2020, the band played an online live stream concert for Wacken World Wide.


=== Appearances ===

The band's first major appearance was in the first part of the 2001 video game Gothic. A group of traveling musicians called 'In-Extremo' plays their version of the song "Herr Mannelig", from the album Verehrt und angespien, by the gallows outside the Old Camp Castle in the second chapter of the game.
The band was invited to participate in the television program Viva Interactive, where they gave a 15-minute call-and-response and played two songs. The band rejected an invitation to Top of the Pops to play "Küss mich" ("Kiss Me"). However, they accepted a further invitation to Top of the Pops in 2005 and played "Nur ihr allein" ("Only You Alone").
At the same time, the band's audience grew with live appearances from marketplaces to festivals like Rock am Ring, the Taubertal Festival, and the Nova Rock in Austria. Their largest public appearance was opening for the farewell tour of Böhse Onkelz in June 2005, with about 120,000 spectators.
In Extremo last participated in the Bundesvision Song Contest of Stefan Raab on 9 February 2006 for the Free State of Thuringia. The group occupied the third spot with "Liam (German)". Beforehand, they had introduced themselves on 2 February on the television show TV total.
In Extremo also played in 2006 at the Wacken Open Air, as well as on the M'era Luna Festival in Hildesheim. At the end of the year, they played their "10 Year Anniversary Tour" in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.


=== Success ===
The first In Extremo album that attracted attention was Verehrt und angespien ("Worshipped and Spat At"), achieving 11th place in the German album charts. The subsequent album, Sünder ohne Zügel ("Unbridled Sinners"), reached 10th place.
The band had further success with the album 7, peaking at number 3 on the German album charts. The video of the single "Küss mich" was frequently shown on German music television.
The eighth album, Mein rasend Herz ("My Racing Heart"), achieved third place on the album charts in 2005. Three singles were published from this album: "Nur ihr allein" ("Only You Alone") on 17 May 2005, "Horizont" ("Horizon") on 12 September 2005, and "Liam (German)" on 3 February 2006. On 10 February 2006, the second live CD/DVD, Raue Spree, was published, coming in at fourth place on the German charts. In addition, the 7 and Raue Spree achieved gold status in early 2007.
The ninth album Sängerkrieg ("Singers' War") went to first place on the album charts of Germany on 23 May 2008. In Austria, it reached the thirteenth place, and in Switzerland, the twenty-second place. In Germany, it was the 50st-best-selling album of 2008.


== Instruments ==
Besides the electric guitar, bass, and drum set, In Extremo uses instruments of predominantly medieval origin. They include hurdy-gurdy, bagpipes, Uilleann Pipes, shawm, nyckelharpa, harp, cittern, tromba marina, hammered dulcimer, Klangbaum, and various types of drums and percussion. Bagpipes are the most common of these instruments, as Dr. Pymonte, Yellow Pfeiffer (until 2021), and Flex der Biegsame all play bagpipes, sometimes all three at once. All of the band members play multiple instruments, and frequently rotate instruments between songs. Das letzte Einhorn frequently plays a cittern during certain songs, such as "Ai vis lo lop".
Their bagpipes were partially made by Dr. Pymonte, but were also partially built by a well-known pipe builder. The band also uses a custom-built frame drum covered in zebra skin, called "Das Pferd" ("The Horse"). Most of the other acoustic instruments, such as their shawms, are only made by a few other instrument builders.


== Style and lyrics ==

The band is known for drawing lyrics from poetry and music of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.
Many of the lyrics to the band's repertoire of medieval songs come from church writings (e.g., "Wessebronner Gebet"), Benedictine writings (e.g., "Raue See"), or are arrangements of traditional songs (e.g., "Merseburger Zaubersprüche", "Tannhuser", "Poc Vecem"). The band also frequently uses songs from the Carmina Burana, as well as the poetry of François Villon ("Rotes Haar" and "Erdbeermund"; translated into German by Paul Zech).
