The Fethiye Mosque (Greek: Φετιχιέ τζαμί; Turkish: Fethiye Camii, lit. 'Mosque of the Conquest') was an Ottoman mosque in Nafpaktos, Greece.
It was built on the orders of Sultan Bayezid II immediately after the capture of the city from the Venetians in 1499, and was the city's main mosque throughout the Ottoman period. It was also known as the Bayezid-i Veli Mosque after its founder. The mosque has been extensively restored and now functions as an exhibition hall.
