Sinfonia (IPA: [siɱfoˈniːa]; plural sinfonie) is the Italian word for symphony, from the Latin symphonia, in turn derived from Ancient Greek συμφωνία symphōnia (agreement or concord of sound), from the prefix σύν (together) and Φωνή (sound). In English it most commonly refers to a 17th- or 18th-century orchestral piece used as an introduction, interlude, or postlude to an opera, oratorio, cantata, or suite (Abate 1999, who gives the origin of the word as Italian) (Lotha, and the Editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica n.d.). The word is also found in other Romance languages such as Spanish or Portuguese.
In the Middle Ages down to as late as 1588, it was also the Italian name for the hurdy-gurdy (Marcuse 1975, p. 477). Johann Sebastian Bach used the term for his keyboard compositions also known as Three-part Inventions, and after about 1800, the term, when in reference to opera, meant "Overture" (Fisher 1998, p. 386).
In George Frideric Handel's oratorio Messiah (HWV 56), "Overture to the Messiah" (French Overture in E minor) was originally titled "Sinfony".
In the 20th and 21st centuries it is found in the names of some chamber orchestras, often pronounced with stress on the second syllable (IPA: [siɱˈfoniːa]), such as the Northern Sinfonia (Kennedy 2006).


== Sinfonias in the vocal works by Johann Sebastian Bach ==

The opening movements of cantatas BWV 31 and BWV 182 are named "sonata" and the first movement of cantata BWV 106 "sonatina". Sinfonia in D major, BWV 1045 is considered a sinfonia of a lost cantata, because its manuscript indicates that the piece had four vocal parts.

Examples of such "sinfonias" composed after the classical era include:

Vincent d'Indy wrote a Sinfonia brevis de bello Gallico, Latin for: "Short Symphony about the War in Gaul".
Igor Stravinsky titled the first movement of his 1923 Octet "Sinfonia".
Benjamin Britten's 1940 Sinfonia da Requiem
