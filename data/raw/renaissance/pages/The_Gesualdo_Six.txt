The Gesualdo Six are a British vocal consort, directed by Owain Park. The group performs a broad-ranging repertoire, from the music of the medieval period through to contemporary compositions of the present day. 
The Gesualdo Six was founded in Cambridge in 2014 for a performance of the Tenebrae Responsories for Maundy Thursday by Carlo Gesualdo, in the chapel of Trinity College. 
The ensemble were St John's Smith Square Young Artists for the 2015–2016 season, and in partnership with St John's Smith Square and the Music Sales Group, curated a composition competition in 2016, which attracted over 170 entries from across the globe. A second composition competition in 2018 attracted over 300 entries.
