The Diocese of Modon or Medone (Latin: Dioecesis Mothonensis) was a "Latin" (Roman Catholic) diocese located in the town of Modon in  Messenia in the Peloponnese region of Greece. It was established in place of the pre-existing Greek Orthodox see in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, with the creation of the Principality of Achaea and the establishment of Venetian rule over Modon in 1209.
Following its fall to the Ottoman Empire, in 1506 it was suppressed and became a titular see.
