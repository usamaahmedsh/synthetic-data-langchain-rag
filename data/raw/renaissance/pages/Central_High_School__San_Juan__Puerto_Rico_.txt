Central High School, also known as La Central or La Central High, is a school located in Santurce barrio of San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The 1925-built building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1987 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2000.
It is a three-story, U-shaped building with Spanish Renaissance architecture.
Its National Register nomination asserts that "Central High School is, for many reasons, the most important school structure built in Puerto Rico in the first decades of the XXth century."
It was built as part of a building program that also yielded the Ponce High School, built in 1915, and the Gautier Benítez High School in Caguas, built in 1924.
