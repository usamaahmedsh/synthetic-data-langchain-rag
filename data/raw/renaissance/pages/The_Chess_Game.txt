The Chess Game is a painting of c. 1530 by Giulio Campi, a Renaissance painter from Cremona. Since 1970, it has been in the Museo Civico d'Arte Antica in Turin.
It was first published in 1963 by Roberto Longhi whilst still in the Nigro collection in Genoa. He attributed it to Sofonisba Anguissola but mentioned similarities to Campi's Allegory in the Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan. Mina Gregori attributed the work to Campi by comparison with a portrait by Giulio of his father Galeazzo in the Uffizi.
