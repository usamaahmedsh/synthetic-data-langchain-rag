The Lessing-Gymnasium (together with its twin school Goethe-Gymnasium) is the oldest Gymnasium in Frankfurt. Named after Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, it was founded in 1519 by the city council.
In 2015 there was a controversy over this school refusing admission to students who were moving up from primary school and who were trying to gain admission to top Frankfurt secondary schools. The headmaster argued that secondary schools have the right to admit the students they desire.
