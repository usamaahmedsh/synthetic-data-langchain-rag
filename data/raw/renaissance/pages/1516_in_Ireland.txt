The Book of Fenagh Irish: Leabar Fidhnacha is a manuscript of prose and poetry written in Classical Irish by Muirgheas mac Pháidín Ó Maolconaire in the monastery at  Fenagh, County Leitrim. It was commissioned by Tadhg O'Roddy, the coarb of the monastery, and is believed to derive from the "old Book of Caillín" (Irish: Leabar Chaillín), a lost work about Caillín, founder of the monastery. Ó Maolconaire began work about 1516.
