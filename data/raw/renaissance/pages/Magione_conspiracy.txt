The Magione conspiracy was a 1502 plot on behalf of several Italian lords to kill or overthrow Cesare Borgia and to split up his dominions, as they believed he was becoming too powerful. The conspirators were Oliverotto Euffreducci, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Gian Paolo Baglioni, Pandolfo Petrucci, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Giovanni Bentivoglio (through his son Ermes) and the leading members of Orsini family. After the failure of the conspiracy, Borgia was able to rearm himself with troops and thus break up the conspiracy by having many of the conspirators –  Vitelli, Euffreducci and two of the Orsini brothers –  killed.
