Aringay, officially the Municipality of Aringay (Ilocano: Ili ti Aringay; Pangasinan: Baley na Aringay; Filipino: Bayan ng Aringay), is a coastal municipality in the province of La Union, Philippines. According to the 2024 census, it has a population of 50,786 people.
Known in Philippine History as the birthplace of revolutionary leader Diego Silang, its economy is based primarily on agriculture - producing rice, tobacco and fruit crops as economic staples. A nascent tourism industry is centered on its beach resorts. Its ethnic population is predominantly Ilocano and Christian (Roman Catholic).


== Etymology ==
The name "Aringay" is attributed to two main theories.
The first theory suggests that the name originated from an early settlement known as Alingay, Alinguey, or Aringuey, which thrived through gold trading along the coastal areas and the Aringay River during the 15th-16th century.
The second theory is rooted in local legend. In the early 16th century, two rival settlements existed on opposite sides of a river, each led by a chieftain. Aring, the daughter of the southern chieftain, and Ayong, the son of the northern chieftain, fell in love despite the disputes between their families.
The lovers met secretly at the river, and during one fateful meeting, Aring’s boat capsized during a storm. Ayong heroically saved her, shouting “Aring-ay!” as he did. This event led to the reconciliation of their families, the union of their settlements, and the naming of the town Aringay in honor of their story.


== History ==


=== Early history ===
In its early history, the town now known as Aringay was referred to as Alingay, Alinguey, or Aringuey. It was a settlement of Pangasinan people strategically located along its coastal areas, lowlands, and the banks of the Aringay River. Historically, this settlement formed part of the northern section of the ancient Pangasinan region.
Aringay played a pivotal role as a coastal maritime trading center, serving as the terminus of the Aringay-Tonglo-Balatok gold trail. This route linked the gold mines of upland Tonglo (in present-day Benguet) to lowland Aringay, facilitating the transport of gold through the nearby port-settlement of Aroo (modern-day Agoo).
The settlement flourished through trade with neighboring groups such as the Samtoy (Ilocano) communities to the north and Cordilleran (Igorot) peoples like the Ibaloi, Ifugao, and Kankanaey in the highlands of the Cordillera Central. Aringay also hosted foreign traders from China mainly from Fujian, Japan, and Maritime Southeast Asia, fostering a vibrant trade network. Goods exchanged in these transactions included porcelain, silk, cotton, beeswax, gemstones, beads, and precious minerals, particularly gold, which was highly valued both regionally and internationally.


=== Spanish Colonization ===
In June 1572, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo and his soldiers arrived in Aringay during their expedition to Northern Luzon. Following the pacification of the nearby settlement of Aroo, they encountered a thriving enclave of ethnic Pangasinan people actively involved in gold trading.
The Spanish attempted to persuade the locals to pay tribute to the Crown and convert to Christianity. However, Salcedo did not establish a permanent foothold in the area, opting instead to continue his expedition northward to Vigan, which he later founded as Villa Fernandina de Vigan in honor of Prince Ferdinand, son of King Philip II.
Subsequently, Augustinian friars and Spanish authorities, led by Captain Alfonso Quirante, formally organized the settlement into a pueblo. The Spaniards imposed their authority by subjugating the locals and foreign merchants and converting them to Christianity. A visita (satellite mission station) was established in Aringay and placed under the jurisdiction of the larger church district in Agoo. New agricultural techniques and the Encomienda System were introduced, entrusting native labor and resources to Spanish encomenderos, friars, and local elites in exchange for tribute and governance.
The gold trade in Aringay eventually declined as Spanish authorities centralized the precious metals industry. This shift disrupted the community’s traditional way of life and reoriented its economy toward agriculture under Spanish influence.
By the 18th century, population pressures and the oppressive conditions imposed by Spanish colonial rule prompted Ilocano migrants from Ylocos provinces and neighboring towns to settle in Aringay. These settlers established communities along the mouth of the Carayan Lucsin (Aringay River), dividing into settlements on the river's northern and southern banks. Over time, they eventually expanded eastward, forming prosperous villages in the surrounding valleys. The migration resulted in Aringay becoming predominantly inhabited by Ilocanos and Ilocanized Pangasinenses.
On December 16, 1741, the settlement was officially organized as a municipality and named Aringay. Don Pablo Vergara served as the first gobernadorcillo under the jurisdiction of Pangasinan province and the Bishopric of Nueva Segovia. Following Spanish urban planning principles, early homes were constructed in a Renaissance grid pattern.
Under Spanish rule, Aringay thrived, with agriculture becoming the primary livelihood. The introduction of modern farming techniques improved productivity in the valleys and plains, while the fishing industry - supported by species like giant carp introduced by East Asian traders - flourished. A Chinese community also developed in the town, contributing significantly to the local economy.


==== Creation of La Union ====
On October 29, 1849, Governor-General Narciso Zaldua Clavería issued a decree merging eight towns from Pangasinan, three from Ilocos Sur, and territories in the Cordillera to form the province of La Union. The establishment of the province was formalized on March 2, 1850, through the Superior Decreto signed by Governor-General Antonio María Blanco.
Aringay was one of the founding towns, alongside San Fernando (the provincial capital), Agoo, Santo Tomas, Rosario, Tubao, Caba, Naguilian, Bauang, San Juan, Balaoan, Luna, Bangar, and Bacnotan. This formation was confirmed on April 18, 1854, by a royal decree (real orden) from Queen Isabella II of Spain.
The towns of Caba and Gallano (later placed in the province of Benguet and then abolished in 1900) were later carved out of Aringay's northern borders.


==== Philippine Revolution ====
During the Philippine Revolution, the residents of Aringay actively participated in the fight for independence against Spanish colonial rule. Under the leadership of General Manuel Tinio y Bondoc, a close ally of Emilio Aguinaldo, the locals engaged in significant resistance efforts in Northern Luzon.
On June 16, 1898, a fierce battle took place in the town plaza, where 96 Katipuneros lost their lives in the struggle for freedom. After months of resistance, Aringay was finally liberated from Spanish control, contributing to the Philippines’ eventual declaration of independence in 1898.


=== American Colonization ===
The independence of the Philippines from Spain was short-lived, as the Philippine-American War soon followed. In 1899, the town of Aringay in La Union became a center of resistance against American forces. Guerrilla Unit No. 5, under the leadership of Captain Fontanilla, operated in Aringay and its neighboring areas, including Agoo, Tubao, Santo Tomas, and Rosario. The guerrilla forces played a crucial role in resisting American advances and defending the town's autonomy. On November 20, 1899, American troops arrived in La Union, leading to a decisive battle at the Aringay River, where the guerrillas inflicted significant damage on the U.S. forces.

By 1901, La Union, including Aringay, was fully under American control. During this period, the Americans continued a railway project initially started by the Spanish colonizers. The Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan, which aimed to stimulate economic growth in the countryside and reduce demands for independence, was renamed the Manila Railroad Company under American management. The railway line reached Aringay in 1912. Efforts to extend the railway from Aringay to Baguio began shortly thereafter, with the Aringay segment completed in 1913. However, the project was abandoned due to financial constraints faced by the Manila Railroad Company. The tunnel constructed in Aringay remains as a historical landmark, having stood for over 105 years. Additionally, a railway bridge connecting Sta. Rita West and Poblacion in Aringay was built as part of the Manila-to-San Fernando, La Union line.
By the 1910s, the American colonial government introduced several public services in the area. A public education system was established, with American teachers known as Thomasites sent to assimilate Filipinos into American culture. Public hospitals were also built, and a local governance system was introduced, allowing Filipinos to elect their own leaders for the first time. These developments marked significant changes in Aringay’s social, educational, and political landscape during the American occupation.


=== Japanese Occupation ===
In December 1941, Japanese forces attacked U.S. military installations and residential areas in Aringay, La Union. By December 22, 1941, the Japanese 14th Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma, landed at the mouth of Aringay River after securing San Fernando and Bacnotan as part of their strategy to secure the Lingayen Gulf and advance their occupation of the Philippines. This event marked the beginning of the Japanese occupation in Aringay.
During this period, the town faced strict control under the Imperial Japanese government, leading to widespread abuses, including torture, sexual slavery, and massacres of local residents. These atrocities left a lasting impact on the community and the region as a whole.
By January 1945, American forces launched a successful campaign in the Battle of Lingayen Gulf, which marked the turning point in liberating northern Luzon from Japanese control. Aringay was officially freed in March 1945 following the Battle of Bacsil Ridge in San Fernando, La Union, which signified the full liberation of the province from Japanese occupation.


=== Failed proposed merger with Agoo ===
In 2014, La Union Second District Representative Eufranio Eriguel filed House Bill 4644, which seeks to merge the municipalities of Agoo and Aringay into a component city to be known as the City of Agoo-Aringay, which would have created new positions for which the former municipal officials could run despite having the terms limits of their offices. This sparked protests from the people of both municipalities, who did not want the merger because it would subject Aringay citizens to the same high local taxes as Agoo, and because of concerns that Agoo and Aringay would lose their cultural identities. The proposed merger thus did not push through within term of the 16th Congress. Later it was pushed again within the term of 20th congress.
