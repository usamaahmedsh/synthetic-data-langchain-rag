Centesimus Annus Pro Pontifice (CAPP) (it: Fondazione Centesimus Annus – Pro Pontifice) is a pontifical foundation.
Pope John Paul II established the "Fondazione Centesimus Annus - Pro Pontifice" on 13 June 1993 along with lay Catholic business, academic and professional leaders. The Foundation is a lay-led non-profit organisation. Its purpose is to promote Catholic social doctrine, especially as expressed in the encyclical Centesimus Annus (1991) and the aims of the Apostolic See. It is headquartered in Vatican City.
