The Anointment of Dionisio: Prophecy and Politics in Renaissance Italy is a 2001 book by American Renaissance historian Marion Leathers Kuntz. The book is a biography of Dionisio Gallo, a previously obscure 16th century humanist preacher based in Venice who advocated for clerical reforms and the destruction of heresy. Gallo's bold proclamations and flamboyant appearance won him detractors and followers; he eventually gained the attention of The Inquisition and was jailed. Kuntz retails how Gallo perplexed the inquisitors, who decided he was of unsound mind and exiled him from Venice, at which point biographical information on him is unavailable.
Kuntz's research into Gallo was praised, although Wietse de Boer, reviewing the book for Church History, thought that Kuntz took Gallo's self-descriptions at face value and could have further contextualized them.
