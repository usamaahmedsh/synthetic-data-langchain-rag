He is considered to be part of the post-Dufay generation in France. He was a friend of Johannes Tinctoris, another composer of the period.

Stokem was born in 1445, probably in Stokkem near Liège. For parts of his life, he served under Beatrice of Aragon, the Queen of Hungary, and as part of the Papal Choir in Rome. He died in either 1487 or 1501.
