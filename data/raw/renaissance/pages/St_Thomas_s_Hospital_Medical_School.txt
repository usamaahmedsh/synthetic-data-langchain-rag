St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in London was one of the oldest and most prestigious medical schools in the[UK. The school was absorbed to form part of GKT School of Medical Education.


== History ==
It was part of one of the oldest hospitals in London, St Thomas's Hospital established in 1173 but whose roots can be traced to the establishment of St Mary Overie Priory in 1106. According to historical records St Thomas's Hospital Medical School was founded in about 1550. It was admitted as a school of the University of London in 1900 but remained a constituent part of St Thomas's Hospital until 1948 when it formally became part of the university. In 1982, it merged with the medical school at Guy's Hospital to form the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals. In turn UMDS was absorbed by King's College London School of Medicine and Dentistry, but the dentists have since been split out into The Dental Institute.


== Name ==
