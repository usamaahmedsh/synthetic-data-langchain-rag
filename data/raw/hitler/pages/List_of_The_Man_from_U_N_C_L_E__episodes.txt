The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is an American television series that ran for three and a half seasons on NBC, from September 22, 1964 to January 15, 1968. It was canceled midway through its fourth season. A total of 105 episodes were produced, each with a 50-minute running time. Season One was filmed entirely in black-and-white, except for the pilot episode, "The Vulcan Affair," and "The Double Affair", which were filmed in color since they were planned to be turned into feature films.
Additional scenes were filmed later, in the case of "Vulcan," and in the case of "Double," concurrently. (The portions of "The 4 Steps Affair" which included the expanded scenes from both feature films had been filmed in color even though all Season One episodes were broadcast in black-and-white.) All subsequent seasons were broadcast in color. Eight feature-length motion pictures were released based on single or double episodes of the show. All 105 episodes were released on DVD in 2007.
