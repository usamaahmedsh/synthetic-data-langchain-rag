On 13 June 2025, Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran by bombing several military and nuclear facilities, beginning the Iran–Israel war and drawing varied reactions across governments and non-governmental entities. The majority of reactions within the Iranian government and public were negative, although some in the Iranian diaspora called for an overthrow of the government. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement addressing the citizens of Iran.
Countries across the world issued their own statements in regards to their stance on the conflict, predominately expressing condemnation of Israeli strikes on Iran or calling on the two countries to de-escalate tensions, and more broadly to de-escalate tensions within the scope of the Middle East. Among Israeli allies, several expressed support for the strikes on Iran, while others issued no official statement. There were also some demonstrations in response to the war.

=== Government ===
The spokesman of the Iranian Armed Forces, Abolfazl Shekarchi, vowed to retaliate against Israel and the United States.  Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei released a statement following the strikes, calling the attacks a "crime" and warned that the "Zionist regime prepared for itself a bitter and painful fate". The Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that Iran has the "legal and legitimate" right to respond to Israeli attacks under the UN Charter, also stating that the US will also be responsible for the "dangerous effects and consequences of the Zionist regime's adventure". The IRGC stated that it is ready to respond even after the death of its chief, Hossein Salami. Ahmad Vahidi was appointed as a temporary IRGC commander until Ali Khamenei appointed Major General Mohammad Pakpour. MP Alaeddin Boroujerdi said that "Iran will not participate in the sixth round of nuclear talks with the United States on [15 June] and until further notice." Former President Mohammad Khatami called for condemnation of this "criminal act" and said that the UN should be at the "forefront" in the effort "to prevent further tragedies by seriously and comprehensively" condemning Israel. Iran warned the United States, United Kingdom, and France that any assistance to Israel will result in their regional bases and ships being targeted, and one of the Iranian missiles has caused damage to the US consulate in Tel Aviv. On 13 June, the head of the Islamic Consultative Assembly's Councils Committee declared that "the Zionist regime and the United States should know that they will receive a swift, decisive, and shattering response." The following day, Mohammad-Reza Bahonar, a member of the Expediency Council, called for targeting U.S. positions in the region, accusing Washington of deceit and urging it to reconsider its support for Israel. Iran's communications ministry announced nationwide internet restrictions. On 19 June 2025, senior official Mohsen Rezaee said that the Israeli attacks was aimed to create chaos in the country by killing top military leaders, but the plan was repelled, saying that Israel's goals is to turn Iran into Syria and plunge it into a 10-year insecurity.
On 24 June 2025, President Masoud Pezeshkian gave a televised address describing the ceasefire as a "great victory". Iranian media claimed that the truce had been imposed on "the enemy" after four waves of attacks on "Israeli-occupied territories", and its National Security Council that it had "shattered the enemy's primary strategic goal". The government sought to convey its resilience, highlighting societal cohesion and civilian solidarity with its aims. Some reports suggested that moderate clerical and political figures had previously urged a truce on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, among them former president Hassan Rouhani, Supreme Leader advisor Ali Larijani, and Expediency Discernment Council chief Sadiq Larijani; a portion of these were rumored to have contemplated sidelining or ousting the Supreme Leader if the latter continued stonewalling negotiators. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in a detailed statement claimed that it was under the leadership of Khamenei throughout the war, and that the 22nd wave of Operation True Promise III had pressured the enemy to call for a ceasefire.


=== Iranian public ===
Following the Israeli strikes that killed senior Iranian commanders, anger mixed with anxiety among many Iranians. In the capital, people gathered around large screens cheering as footage of Iran's missile response aired, while others expressed hope that the conflict would not escalate into full war. Protesters rallied in Tehran chanted slogans against Israel, calling for a forceful response and warning that without firm action, Iran could face the kind of devastation seen in Gaza. 
According to The Washington Post, state restrictions and reluctance among Iranians to speak openly with international media make it "difficult to gauge public sentiment in Iran." Ongoing economic challenges, political restrictions, and international tensions have led to widespread frustration and disillusionment regarding prospects for reform. Some Iranians interviewed by the Post expressed satisfaction at the deaths of certain government officials, with a few using the Eid al-Ghadir holiday to express such sentiments. Others suggested that the news seemed more alarming to observers abroad, noting that Iranians have endured significant hardships in the past. Demonstrations in support of the government and against Israel were also reported. NPR quoted one woman expressing approval of the Israeli attack, while others described the news as a rare moment of relief amid years of difficulties. Some Iranians chanted slogans against Supreme Leader Khamenei, while social media users proposed symbolic targets like state-run media and his son Mojtaba Khamenei, linked to past crackdowns. However, some observers expressed concern that destabilizing the leadership through targeted killings could lead to anarchy and broader regional instability.
Iranian security forces have initiated a broad crackdown on individuals accused of sharing content considered "supportive of Israel." On 13 June, the Hormozgan Provincial Police Command reported the arrest of 14 citizens, claiming that, after the Israeli strikes, they "attempted to disturb public opinion and spread rumors in cyberspace were identified through technical and intelligence measures". At least 10 Iranians were held in custody on espionage charges linked to Israel.
However, many Iranians expressed concern about escalation, and demonstrations against Israel were also reported. Protesters in Qom and Tehran called for retaliation. Protesters waved the flags of Iran and Palestine and carried portraits of slain IRGC general Qasem Soleimani. In Tehran, demonstrators displayed images of slain commanders and scientists, with some participants expressing that Israel's complete defeat, rather than simple retaliation, was necessary to ensure long-term security. Others expressed feeling fearful of the current situation: "We are killed a thousand times with stress, especially for people like myself who have kids".
Homayoun Sameh, the Jewish representative in Iran's parliament, stated that Israel is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity and also emphasized that Iranian Jews are part of the Iranian people. A Jewish community representative in Isfahan publicly condemned Israel's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, calling them acts of "brutality" that caused the deaths of "beloved compatriots, including innocent children."
An Iran International article expressed civilians disappointment in Khamenei during and after the war. One referred to him as a "coward" hiding in his bunker, another said Khamenei is living in an "illusion", believing Iran won the war and passing a message of victory.


==== Civil society responses ====
Following the ceasefire, which ended the 12-day conflict, routine activities in Tehran began to resume. Commercial establishments, public services, and internet access were gradually restored, and residents returned to daily routines. Reports indicated that some individuals engaged in community-oriented actions, such as assisting elderly neighbors, caring for stray animals, and providing temporary shelter to those displaced by the hostilities.
In the aftermath of the war that began 13 June 2025, hundreds of babies born in Tehran, Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz were given names with political and cultural significance, such as Arash (after activist Arash Sadeghi), Nika (after protest martyr Nika Shakarami), Kaveh, Yasamin, Reza, Farah, and Ali‑Reza, marking a quiet but powerful form of defiance amid blackouts, curfews, and fear. According to maternity ward physicians, each name served as a message of hope and the enduring spirit of freedom.
An ABC interview exposed young Iranians expectations following the war. They expressed that, following decades of internal unrest and in the context of recent Israeli military actions targeting the Islamic Republic, the current regime's continued hold on power is untenable. However, there is uncertainty regarding how the change will occur. It was noted in the article that these individuals identities were with-held for their safety following recent arrests and executions.
A similar interview from BBC also found divided public opinion among younger Iranians opposed to the Iranian regime. Some expressed support for Israel's actions against the Iranian government, while others rejected war as a correct method of opposition and expressed concern for civilian casualties in a prolonged war. There was also critique towards the Iranian government's response to the war, such as the decision to cut internet access and set up checkpoints to prevent evacuations in targeted areas and drive up casualty rates.


==== September 2025 Survey ====
A survey conducted by GAMAAN at the end of September 2025, with over 30,000 Iranian participants, revealed their responses to the Iran-Israel war: 44% believe that the Islamic Republic is responsible for starting the war, while only 33% blame Israel. More than half (51%) think that Israel achieved its objectives, compared to only 16% who believe the Islamic Republic was successful. 42% expressed anger toward the Islamic Republic during the war. 63% believe that the war was between Israel and the Islamic Republic, not against the Iranian people. 58% responded that the Islamic Republic failed to protect the population. 58% gave a negative rating to the performance of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei during the war. 69% think that the Islamic Republic should stop calling for the destruction of Israel. 47% agree that to prevent another war, the Islamic Republic must stop uranium enrichment, while 49% oppose Iran developing nuclear weapons.

The People's Mojahedin of Iran (MKO) co-leader Maryam Rajavi called on the Iranian people to overthrow the government, while not openly supporting Israel. She also warned against negotiating with Khamenei.

Opposition
The US-based National Iranian American Council condemned Israel's attack, writing that it "lacked legal justification under international law" and "unnecessarily endangered the lives of many innocent people". The Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA) expressed deep distress and alarm over the Israeli military strikes, particularly those that impacted civilian infrastructure. Their statement affirmed, "We condemn any military aggression that endangers civilian lives and destabilizes an already volatile region".
Others also criticized the strikes. Iran analyst Arash Azizi criticized Israel for striking on the eve of talks, stating that the strikes undercut diplomatic efforts. Iranian-American policy write and activist, Trita Parsi said that Israel had "tried to sabotage any diplomacy" between the U.S. and Iran for two decades, stating they deliberately sought to derail negotiations and prevent any easing of tensions.
Columbia University professor Hamid Dabashi argued that the strikes were partly intended to shift global focus away from the "genocide in Palestine."

== Israel ==
In a televised 13 June address, Netanyahu said, "We are at a decisive moment in Israel's history" and "we are defending the free world from the terrorism and barbarism that Iran fosters and exports across the globe." He thanked Trump for his support and said the attack was an immediate operational necessity to roll back the threat of uranium enrichment. He said the attacks would continue for "as long as is needed to complete the task of fending off the threat of annihilation against us." and that Israel's war was against the Iranian form of government and not against the Iranian people. Netanyahu convened the security cabinet as the situation unfolded. Israeli government officials said Iran already possessed enough enriched uranium for 15 nuclear bombs.
IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir stated in a televised address that the Israeli Army is "mobilizing tens of thousands of soldiers and preparing across all borders," as he warned that "anyone who tries to challenge us will pay a heavy price" and that "it was at point of no return".

In his address, Netanyahu stated Israel's conflict was with Iran's government, not its people. Some Iranians, including diaspora voices, echoed this sentiment, calling for strikes on domestic targets. Israeli officials claimed most engagement came from within Iran, calling the response "unprecedented." 
On 18 June Brigadier General Kobi Mandelblit, announced new rules on what Israeli media organisations and journalists within the country can and cannot publish about the effect of Iranian strikes, effectively restricting media coverage about the strikes.
Hostage families who protest against the government, fear their loved ones will be forgotten during the ongoing war.
On 24 June Netanyahu hailed the ceasefire as corroborating Israeli success, claiming that it marked a "historic victory" over Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions "which would stand for generations".  On 27 June Katz warned the ceasefire would only last so long as Iran refrained from attempting to reconstitute its ballistic missile or nuclear programs, outlining an "enforcement plan" by which Israel would hold Iran to account–noting that since the 7 October 2023 attacks Iran was no longer immune to Israeli action, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves is said to have suggested that the UK will assist in Israel's protection, but according to reports, the UK has no plans to defend Israel from retaliation by Iran. Later the same day, Starmer said the UK has "long held concerns" about Iran's nuclear programme, and that he "absolutely recognize[s] Israel's right to self-defence." At the same time, he stressed the need for "de-escalation." Starmer reiterated those messages during a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. On 14 June, the UK began relocating fighter jets to the Middle East as a "contingency" measure, according to PM Starmer, who also hinted it could involve defensive support for Israel. On 15 June, the UK began advising against all travel to Israel.

He added that the Iranian people "deserve better than the current brutal regime," indicating his support for the Iranian opposition.
Speaking on behalf of the Green Party, MP Ellie Chowns expressed alarm at Israel's "targeted assassinations and widespread bombing of Iran" and denounced Israel as "a rogue state operating outside international law".

 Scotland: First Minister John Swinney warned that the "conflict with Iran has the potential to escalate to a very dark place" and that "the international community and the United Kingdom Government particularly have got to marshal their efforts to constrain Israel and to de-escalate this conflict, both in Gaza and between Israel and Iran... [and] the sooner that happens, the better."
 Wales: First Minister Eluned Morgan stated "it's very concerning to see how that instability could spiral out of control". She added that "the implications are grave not just for the Middle East but for us as well. There will be a knock-on effect, for example on the price of petrol... We are not immune from what's happening in the Middle East. This is a very concerning situation and comes on top of the difficult situation in Gaza which is completely unacceptable."
The British Foreign Secretary declared that the Islamic Republic is the greatest threat to global security.

 United States: President Donald Trump praised the Israeli strikes as "excellent" and "very successful," and warned that Iran must "make a deal now" over its nuclear program or face "even more destructive and deadly military action." He also said there had already been "great death and destruction" and cautioned that future strikes would be "even more brutal." Trump criticized Iran for refusing multiple chances to reach an agreement, saying he told them to "just do it," but that they "just couldn't get it done." He further pledged continued military support stating: "Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come – and they know how to use it" and suggested that the attacks were coordinated with the talks he was conducting: "we gave Iran 60 days to make a deal and today is 61, right?". Trump authorized US forces to assist in intercepting the initial Iranian missile barrage. The US warned Iran against attacking American interests or personnel, emphasizing it would respond militarily if such attacks occurred. On 17 June, Trump stated that a "real end" was better than a ceasefire. He then demanded unconditional surrender by Iran. Trump also threatened Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei saying that he is an "easy target" and could assassinate him at any moment. The threat came two days after it was reported that Trump allegedly vetoed a plan by Israel to assassinate the ayatollah.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Israel acted independently, stating the U.S. was not involved. He said that Israel informed the U.S. it viewed the attack as an act of self-defense.

=== Others ===
 Kosovo: Acting Prime Minister Albin Kurti stated "The Republic of Kosovo is following with concern the tense situation between Israel and Iran and calls on all parties involved to exercise restraint, in order to avoid further escalation of the security crisis in the region...

 Northern Cyprus: Prime Minister Ünal Üstel stated "The statements directed at our country and at the President of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, are clear examples of slander and distortion...

On 19 June, Secretary-General Naim Qassem condemned the attacks and stated that Hezbollah is "not neutral" and stands with Iran, further stating that Trump's suggestion that the US could assassinate Ali Khamenei is an "aggression" against all the people of the region. Qassem also stated that Hezbollah will "act as we see fit in the face of this brutal Israeli-American aggression."
 Houthis: The Houthis condemned the attacks and said they "support Iran's right to defend itself."

Small protests also took place in several cities in the US, urging the Trump administration not to join the military action, including in Washington D.C., in front of the White House, where smaller numbers of counter-protesters gathered to try to disrupt the event. Anti-war protests also appeared in Times Square, New York City and Boston with protesters carrying signs against US intervention.
Tens of thousands of Iraqis gathered during Friday prayer in Sadr City in support of Iran and chanted anti-US slogans.
During Friday prayer, people gathered in southern Beirut in support of Iran, waving the flags of Iran, Palestine and Hezbollah.

Al Jazeera reported that hundreds of thousands of people attended protests against Israeli strikes that were held at the cities of Tehran, Tabriz, Shiraz, Isfahan, Mashhad, Qom, Qazvin and Yazd as well as in Gilan province. Footage showed them waving Iranian and Hezbollah flags and photographs of assassinated Iranian commanders and Khamenei. Among the participants were Chief Justice of Iran Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i, former IRGC commander Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, as well as several ministers and the deputy speaker of parliament.


=== Public opinion ===

On 14 June, several pro-Palestine and pro-Iran demonstrators marched through the streets in London and gathered in Parliament Square waving Palestinian and Iranian flags as well as chanted "stop bombing Iran". Protestors demanded an end of the bombing in Iran and Gaza and urged the government to halt military support to Israel. Some supporters of Trump in the United States have criticized Trump's support for Israeli strikes against Iran, and the possible involvement of the United States in the war. In a poll of Trump voters conducted prior to the onset of U.S. intervention, 53% said the country should not get involved in the Iran–Israel conflict. US intervention into the war would cause many social media accounts to post Internet  memes about World War III. Opinion polling on Americans on US involvement in the war by YouGov found 85% of those surveyed were opposed to the war, while 5% supported and 10% were unsure of it.

=== Institutes ===
Muhanad Seloom of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies suggested that, while "bruised severely", Iran was unwilling to risk a wider conflict with the U.S. and its European allies, saying its limited response to date was "below the threshold" of all-out war and indicated a willingness to reenter nuclear negotiations; he also noted that Israeli airstrikes had not completely destroyed Iranian nuclear facilities. A few days later, National Iranian American Council president Jamal Abdi concurred, noting that, while refraining from striking U.S. forces, Iran has refused to abandon the Non-Proliferation Treaty, evict inspectors, or blockade the Strait of Hormuz.
The New Lines Institute described Israel's strikes as "a dangerous escalation against the backdrop of the war in Gaza" and noted that the conflict with Iran is complicating Gaza ceasefire negotiations. The Atlantic Council experts cited reporting from Gaza where civilians fear the Israel–Iran war will distract from the starvation and killing of Palestinians. Al Jazeera reported that as attention turns to Iran, Israel has escalated violence against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, quoting human rights researchers warning the conflict is being used to intensify repression while international scrutiny is diverted.
A report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) concluded that Israeli operations forced the Iranian government to accept the truce, allowing Israel to achieve a key objective, despite strikes being limited to imposing costs on resistance rather than reflecting an effort to topple the regime; supporting this, the report observed that Israel did not systematically target domestic security on a nationwide basis, largely focusing on installations in the Iranian capital Tehran. Instead, Israel sought to "demonstrate a credible threat" to the regime should it decide to resume or expand its campaign, the report determined. Citing an estimate by the Institute for Science and International Security, the ISW assessed Iranian enrichment abilities as having been severely curtailed by American and Israeli strikes, calculating that "the loss of so many centrifuges and facilities" would impede nuclear activities for the foreseeable future. The ISW also reported that Israeli interdictions and attacks on launchers reduced the volume of ballistic missile assaults on Israel, forcing Iran to rely on "much fewer" and "smaller" barrages; these Israeli efforts further compelled Iran to submit.


=== Iranian preparedness ===
Iranian leaders anticipated the possibility of hostilities if nuclear negotiations with the United States stalled, but miscalculated the timing of any such engagement, The New York Times reported, citing officials close to the leaders who said Iran had not expected an Israeli offensive before the next scheduled round of talks in Oman, and therefore dismissed warning signs as psychological operations aimed at securing diplomatic leverage. This misjudgment led to a failure to implement defensive protocols that had been previously discussed. High-ranking military personnel, including senior commanders of the IRGC, ignored directives to disperse or shelter, resulting in the deaths of key figures during targeted strikes on military facilities, most notably in Tehran.


=== Legality ===
The International Commission of Jurists released a statement saying "Israel's attack on Iran violates international law, threatening peace and security" and calling on "Iran and Israel to comply with their non-proliferation obligations and ensure IAEA's access to all their nuclear facilities". Marko Milanović, Kevin Jon Heller and Sergey Vasiliev, all scholars of international law, have described these attacks as a crime of aggression. EBS University Wiesbaden professor of international law Matthias Goldmann said that the requirements for legal self-defense are "rather strict": "They require an imminent attack that cannot be fended off in any other way. If you apply that requirement, you come to the conclusion that there was no attack imminent from Iran." He said: "My impression is that the majority of legal analysts see [Israel's attack] as a case of 'prohibited self-defense'." Writing in the European Journal of International Law, Marko Milanovic, Professor of Public International Law in the UK, stated, "To conclude, even if the broadest possible (legally plausible) understanding of anticipatory self-defence was taken as a correct, Israel's use of force against Iran would be illegal. This is because there is little evidence that Iran has irrevocably committed itself to attacking Israel with a nuclear weapon, once it develops this capability." Goldmann said that the Cold War doctrine of mutually assured destruction demonstrates that possession of nuclear weapons in itself cannot be considered an imminent attack. Deutsche Welle noted that Israel itself possesses undeclared nuclear weapons.
In 2012, there had been differing positions regarding a potential attack against Iran over its nuclear programme, which were summarised by law professor Andrew Garwood-Gowers, who said that "the notion of preemptive self-defence against remote threats has no basis in current international law", and concluded that "from an international law standpoint, a unilateral military strike against Iran would be illegal". He noted that Israel's 1981 attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor was widely condemned at the time, including by the United States. 
The Turkish government said that the Israeli action "constitutes a blatant violation of international law". The Israeli Ambassador to the UN commented that "This was an act of national preservation. It was one we undertook alone, not because we wanted to, but because we were left no other option". Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has been supportive of talks with the United States to revive the agreement Iran reached with the US and other world powers in 2015.


=== Media ===
The Jerusalem Post suggested Iran's possible retaliation could entail proxy attacks, ballistic missiles and drones, naval and "asymmetric" threats, attacks on targets based outside the country, conventional armed forces or diplomatic attacks.
According to Foreign Policy, most of the American-allied countries have failed to recognize the danger posed by the Iranian regime which seeks to "leverage American gullibility and caution to Tehran's advantage". Israel, according to the paper, decided to resolve the Iranian threat, deemed "existential" by Israelis and strike the "head of the snake" and end the Iranian threat.
Mohammad Eslami, a researcher at the University of Tehran and head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, suggested that a retaliatory attack was supported by most of Iran's domestic political parties, a near unanimity not seen since the Iran–Iraq War.
According to the Atlantic Council's Daniel B. Shapiro, the attacks by Israel laid bare the weakness of Iran in the aftermath of the 7 October attacks, claiming that Israel has achieved full penetration of Iran and has demonstrated capabilities to strike at targets across much of the country. "Iran has never looked weaker, and its ability to respond meaningfully will be tested", he concluded. Military analyst Richard Kemp argued that Israel "had no choice but to attack," describing Iran as a regime pursuing nuclear weapons and supporting terrorism. With diplomacy exhausted, he warned that inaction would risk allowing a regime with a history of violence to obtain nuclear arms. Kemp called for continued support for Israel and cautioned that renewed negotiations would likely fail, as Iran "would not honour" any deal.
Writing for Al Jazeera English, Imad El-Anis, an international relations expert on the Middle East, pointed to Israel's capability of smuggling drones into Iran and to operate in Iranian airspace signals a marked shift in the balance of power. According to El-Anis, Israel exploitation of these weaknesses is unprecedented in the history of the conflict between the two nations. Al Jazeera's senior political analyst Marwan Bishara argued that Israel was obliterating the recent pragmatic turn in Iran's foreign policy and suggested that Netanyahu had pursued the narrative of Iran as an "existential threat" to Israel since his first cabinet position in the early 1990s.
US diplomat and former Department of State official Thomas M. Countryman called Trump's apparent use of Israeli attacks as a negotiating strategy with Iran "profoundly misguided" and alleged that Netanyahu was hoping for Iran to target American positions in the Middle East and thereby provoke the United States to enter the conflict. According to US nuclear expert Jim Walsh, Israel's attacks could produce the opposite effect to the stated intention in forcing Tehran to pursue nuclear weapons.
Charles Moore, Baron Moore of Etchingham claimed that Israel's strikes reflect lessons from the 7 October Hamas attacks, emphasizing the need to avoid being caught off guard. He described Iran as an "active existential threat" unlike more abstract dangers faced by most nations. Moore suggested that while Netanyahu's approach remains controversial domestically, there is broad Israeli consensus on the threat posed by Iran, which he believes the West underestimates. Hamid Gholamzadeh, director of Tehran's Diplo House think tank, Ali Akbar Darani, a researcher at the Center for Strategic Studies in Tehran and Abas Aslani, a senior researcher at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies, suggested that Israeli attacks on Iranian energy and other sites have failed to create domestic unrest and the possibility of a regime change and instead united the population, even the ones that opposed the ruling government, with Darani stating: "I have rarely seen such national unity".
In an interview with BBC Persian, political analyst Mojtaba Najafi criticized the lack of national unity in the face of external threats. He argued that the Iranian establishment's suppression of public expression had weakened internal cohesion, stating: "One of the reasons Israel dared to attack was Iran's internal problems. ... Unresolved crises and deep anger have distorted the meaning of nationhood in Iran, allowing a foreign force to attack without fear." Accordign to The Economist that the Iranian regime was facing internal discontent and external pressure. It reported that some Iranians had celebrated the assassination of key military leaders. It argued that Israel's campaign had exposed the "failure of the regime's military strategy" and raised hopes for an uprising or coup.
Amnesty International warned that Israel's military escalation with Iran should not be allowed to divert global attention from what it called Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, its illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, and its system of apartheid. The Daily Star argued that Israel's strikes on Iran are occurring alongside, and politically connected to, its "genocidal policies" in Gaza, enabled by Western diplomatic and military support.
