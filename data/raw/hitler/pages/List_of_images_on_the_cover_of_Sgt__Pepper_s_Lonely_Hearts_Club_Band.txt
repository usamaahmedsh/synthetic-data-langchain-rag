The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band has a widely recognized album cover that depicts several dozen celebrities and other images. The image was made by posing the Beatles in front of life-sized black and white photographs pasted onto hardboard and hand-tinted.


== Concept ==
The cover image was created by Jann Haworth and Peter Blake, who in 1967 won the Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts, for their work on it. Blake has said that the intention was to show a new band surrounded by fans after a performance. In an interview with American Songwriter, he said:

I suggested that they had just played a concert in the park. They were posing for a photograph and the crowd behind them was a crowd of fans who had been at the concert. Having decided on this, then, by making cut-outs, the fans could be anybody, dead or alive, real or fictitious. If we wanted Hansel and Gretel, I could paint them and they could be photographed and blown up. I asked the four Beatles for a list and I did one myself. Robert Fraser did a list and I can't remember whether Brian Epstein did one or not. The way that worked out was fascinating. John gave me a list and so did Paul. George suggested only Indian gurus, about six of them, and Ringo said, "Whatever the others say is fine by me" and didn't suggest anyone. It's an insight into their characters. All kinds of people were suggested. Hitler was there; he is actually in the set-up, but he is covered by the Beatles themselves as we felt he was too controversial. The same applied to Jesus. There were only two of their contemporaries on the cover. Bob Dylan was suggested by John and I put on Dion because he is a great favourite of mine.

== Excluded and obscured people ==
(12) Leo Gorcey – modelled and originally included to the left of Huntz Hall, but subsequently removed when a fee of $400 ($3,755 in 2024) was requested for the use of the actor's likeness.
(45C) Adolf Hitler – requested by Lennon and modelled behind the band (to the right of Larry Bell), but moved out of frame (being "too controversial", according to Blake) and replaced by Johnny Weissmuller. Blake uniquely insists that Hitler was hidden behind the band during the final shoot.
(54A) Unidentified figure – barely visible behind the wax figure of Harrison
(56A) Sophia Loren (actress) – behind the Beatles' waxworks
(58A) Marcello Mastroianni (actor) – behind the Beatles' waxworks, only the top of the hat is slightly visible
(65B) Timothy Carey (actor) – modelled and originally included but largely obscured by Harrison in the final picture
(68) Mahatma Gandhi – modelled and originally included to the right of Lewis Carroll, but subsequently removed. According to McCartney, "Gandhi also had to go because the head of EMI, Sir Joe Lockwood, said that in India they wouldn't allow the record to be printed".
Jesus Christ – requested by Lennon, but not modelled due to the controversy ignited by Lennon's "more popular than Jesus" statement the year before.
