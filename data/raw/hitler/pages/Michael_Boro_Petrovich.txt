Michael Boro Petrovich (Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America, 18 October 1922 - Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A., 28 March 1989) was a second generation Serbian American, who became a professor, educator, scholar, translator and author of numorous political and historical works. He was one of the founding fathers of postwar "Slavic and East European studies" across North America.


== Biography ==
Michael Petrovich was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on 18 October 1922 to Serbian Orthodox priest Boro Petrovich and Croatian-born Anne Marie Petrovich (née Roper). Michael Boro Petrovich graduated from Kansas City Junior College in Kansas in 1941. Two years later, he received his bachelor's degree from Western Reserve University, his master's degree in 1947, and his Doctor of Philosophy in 1955, all from Columbia University.


== World War II ==
During World War II (between 1943 and 1945), he was an officer in the OSS, along with other Serbian Americans, namely Eli Popovich (of the Popovich Brothers of Chicago fame), George Musulin, George Vujnovich, Michael Rajacich, Nick Lalich, and others who readily volunteered to fight Hitler's Nazis. Petrovich was a member of the Independent Yugoslavia and the Allies' Mission to Josip Broz Tito in Belgrade in 1945. The relationship between the British and American intelligence and special operations services was ambiguous in their support of the Old Order (Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Later, Petrovich learned that under the terms of the London Agreement signed in June 1942, all Office of Strategic Services (OSS) missions in Europe were under the command of SOE and not OSS as it was initially believed. With the help of the Allied Powers, Tito went on to usurp the government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after the war and even attempted to expand territorial claims into Trieste, Italy, by ignoring the Armistice of Cassibile and forcing the creation of the Free Territory of Trieste.


== Post-War Career ==
Petrovich's academic career began as an instructor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison from 1950 to 1953. There he was tenured as assistant professor from 1953 to 1956; associate professor from 1956 to 1960; Evjue-Bascom Professor from 1982 to 1988; and professor emeritus from 1988. He was also a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley in 1956, and a visiting professor at Harvard University in 1957. He also worked closely in collaboration with publisher William Jovanovich of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and Drenka Willen on many academic and literary projects from the 1950s to 1980s. He was a member of several scholarly societies and associations.
In 1987, he was diagnosed as suffering from terminal cancer. In 1988, during the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies (AAASS), held in Honolulu, he was unable to attend. However, he received the achievement award by mail. A few months later, he died on 28 March 1989, aged 67.
