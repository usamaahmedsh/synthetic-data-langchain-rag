Larry David pursues a new television project, first with Jason Alexander, and then Julia Louis-Dreyfus after Jason offends him. Based on Alexander's frustration with his own post-Seinfeld career/life, the premise is about an actor who starred in a megahit sitcom who finds himself typecast.

Larry joins a restaurant venture with a group of investors; among them are Ted Danson and Michael York. A few subplots involve Larry being cast in a Martin Scorsese movie; an on-again, off-again feud with Stu and Susan Braudy; and Larry getting a pubic hair stuck in his throat.


=== Season 4 (2004) ===

=== Season 5 (2005) ===
Larry's friend Richard needs a kidney transplant operation. Under pressure from his friends and family, Larry offers to donate his own kidney to Richard. Larry then makes concerted efforts to find Richard another kidney donor. Larry thinks that he may have been adopted, because of a potentially misunderstood word his father said (and subsequently denies) while in the hospital, and hires a private investigator (Mekhi Phifer) to look into it.


=== Season 6 (2007) ===
Cheryl and Larry shelter a New Orleans family named the Blacks (Vivica A. Fox, J. B. Smoove and Ellia English), who move into their house after a hurricane destroyed the Blacks' home. A distracted phone call between Larry and Cheryl causes her to re-evaluate their marriage dynamic and leave him; Larry thus returns to the dating scene.

She and the rest of the family leave Larry's home—except for Leon, who stays with him. When Larry runs into Cheryl for the first time since last season, he learns that she appreciated him more when he had a job, so he accepts NBC's offer for a Seinfeld reunion show to give her a part in it and win her back.

=== Season 10 (2020) ===
Larry is accused of sexual harassment by his assistant Alice and his attempts to control the situation only serve to make things worse. At the same time, Larry intends to open his own coffee shop, which he calls a spite store, right next to Mocha Joe's out of spite, regarding petty grievances.


=== Season 11 (2021) ===
After a burglar drowns in Larry's pool, the police inform Larry he must have a five-foot (1.5 m) fence around his pool. The burglar's brother, Marcos, extorts Larry by threatening to sue him, unless Larry casts Marcos' daughter, Maria Sofia, in his new Netflix show about himself in his 20s. Maria Sofia lacks acting skills, so Larry seeks to have the fence law changed. He does so by beginning a relationship with an unattractive, unpleasant councilwoman, so he can eject Maria Sofia from his show. Leon breaks up with his girlfriend Mary Ferguson after purchasing non-refundable plane tickets to Asia for the pair. Leon tries to find another woman with the same name to replace his ex on the trip.
