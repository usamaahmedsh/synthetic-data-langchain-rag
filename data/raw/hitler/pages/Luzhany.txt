== History ==
First mentioned in a 1452 deed, Luzhany belonged to the Danubian Principality of Moldavia until 1774/75, when upon the Russo-Turkish War its northwestern parts (the Bukovina) were ceded to the Habsburg monarchy. Incorporated into the Austrian Duchy of Bukovina from 1849, the area was incorporated into Greater Romania after World War I. In 1940, as a result of a secret clause of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact between Hitler and Stalin, the Romanian state was forced to cede Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union.
In 1968, Luzhany received urban-type settlement status.
Luzhany became part of independent Ukraine in 1991.
Until 18 July 2020, Luzhany belonged to Kitsman Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Chernivtsi Oblast to three. The area of Kitsman Raion was split between Chernivtsi Raion and Vyzhnytsia Raion, with Luzhany being transferred to Chernivtsi Raion.
On 26 January 2024, a new law entered into force which abolished the status of urban-type settlement in Ukraine, and Luzhany became a rural settlement.
