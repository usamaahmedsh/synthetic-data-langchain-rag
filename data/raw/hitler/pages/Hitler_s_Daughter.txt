== Synopsis ==
While waiting for their school bus, a group of children tell stories to pass the time. Mark's friend Anna tells a story about Hitler's secret daughter Heidi, a young girl who was kept hidden to maintain the secret of her identity. The other children are captivated by the story, which Anna tells with great detail and realism. As the children listen to the story about Heidi's life, her relationship with her father, and her increasing awareness of Hitler's evil plans, Mark becomes interested in learning more about the actual history of Hitler and World War II, and wonders how he would have acted in Heidi's place. Anna finishes her story with Heidi escaping from the ruins of Berlin and emigrating to Australia, where she grows old and eventually reveals the truth to her granddaughter.
