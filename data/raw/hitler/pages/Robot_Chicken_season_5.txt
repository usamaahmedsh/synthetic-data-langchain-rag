The fifth-season finale celebrates the show's 100th episode, featuring an alternate storyline, in which the Robot Chicken from the show's opening sequence is accidentally freed from the chair by the castle maid and escapes the Mad Scientist's lair. When RC returns home, he comes to find that his house has been broken into and discovers that his wife has been kidnapped by the Mad Scientist and is being forced to take his place in the chair. RC is then forced to return to the Mad Scientist's castle and battle his way through a series of Robot Chicken characters before finally meeting his maker in a final battle for his wife.
