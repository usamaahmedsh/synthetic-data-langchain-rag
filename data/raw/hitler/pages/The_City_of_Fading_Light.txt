The City of Fading Light is a 1985 novel written by Australian author Jon Cleary about a Hollywood actress who tries to rescue her Jewish mother from 1939 Berlin. The book features Sean Carmody, the character from his earlier novel The Sundowners.
Cleary researched the novel on a trip to Berlin with his family and based the plot on a real British plan to assassinate Hitler prior to the war.
