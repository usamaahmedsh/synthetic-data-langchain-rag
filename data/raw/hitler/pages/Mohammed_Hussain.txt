India won the next two matches against Jhansi Heroes and Bhopal State XI easily.

== After the Olympics ==
In his book The World's Hockey Champions 1936, Mirza Masood mentions a song sung by Mohammed Hussain at Konigssee, a favourite resort of Hitler on weekends. He writes "At the request of some of the members, Mohammad Hussain sang two love songs in Urdu in his clear, melodious voice. The songs took us far away from the scenic beauty of the Bavarian lake to India and her people. Isn't it strange that when we were enjoying the most the sight of the beautiful lake, a mere song put into oblivion what was so impressive a moment before, and carried us on the wings of imagination to the people whom we had long left behind? Such is the strong tie of the motherland!"
