== Plot ==
The film takes place in 1942, during the Great Patriotic War (World War II). The film is based on real events that took place during the Second World War between August and October 1942, when Russian soldier and Soviet partisan officer Nikolai Kiselev rescued 218 Jews from the Holocaust. The story begins when Kiselev receives the order to evacuate over two hundred Jews, including old men, women and children, from Belorussian-occupied territories behind the front lines, after Hitler had declared Belarus a Jew-free (judenfrei) territory. The emaciated people, tormented by hunger and fear, who had lost their relatives and had almost lost their minds from the horror they experienced, would have to walk hundreds of kilometres through the forest paths to recover the faith and hope of a better world.
