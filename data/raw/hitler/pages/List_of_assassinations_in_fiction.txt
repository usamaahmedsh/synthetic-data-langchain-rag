Assassinations have formed a major plot element in works of fiction. This article provides a list of such works.
Assassination is the murder of a prominent person for a motive that is broadly public and political rather than merely personal or financial.
Assassinations in fiction have attracted scholarly attention.  In Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy: Transformations in Society and Culture, Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi — as well as analyzing Italian assassinations in their historical and cultural contexts — explore films, plays, other forms of fiction, and works of art that have been inspired by the act of assassination. Nick Cullather has discussed "the movie version" of John F. Kennedy's assassination.
This list article preferentially highlights some less familiar cultural works while eschewing run-of-the-mill Ian Fleming or Agatha Christie titles and like Mafia films. The historical—historically–based or historically–inspired—takes precedence over the purely fictional and sensational.
