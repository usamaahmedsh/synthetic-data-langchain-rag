Bernhard Otto Lasch (25 June 1893 in Pleß, Oberschlesien – 28 April 1971) was a German general in the Wehrmacht during World War II who commanded the LXIV Corps. He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves.


== Life ==
The son of Prince Pless's chief forester, Otto Lasch (d. 22 March 1924), joined the Jäger Battalion "Prince Bismarck" (Pomeranian) No. 2 in Kulm as an officer candidate, after graduating from Gymnasium with Abitur, on 27 March 1913, with which he participated in the First World War. Towards the end of the war, he was deployed as an aerial observer.
After World War I, Lasch served in the Freikorps in the East Prussian city of Lyck (where his brother Karl Lasch was a city councilor and, since 15 July 1916, First Mayor) as part of the Border Protection East. From 1 January 1920 to 1935, he served with the police, finally as a Police Major. He joined the Wehrmacht on 15 October 1935 and later took part in Operation Barbarossa, playing a pivotal role in capturing Riga in early July 1941. He rose to the rank of General of the Infantry in 1944 and functioned as Commandant of Königsberg in East Prussia from November 1944 onward. As Fortress Commandant of Königsberg he was responsible for defending the city and maintaining order among the flood of refugees fleeing from the invading Red Army.
Following heavy fighting and a three month siege of the city during the Battle of Königsberg by the 36-division-strong 3rd Byelorussian Front under Ivan Chernyakhovsky, Lasch disobeyed Hitler's orders and surrendered Königsberg to the Red Army on 9 April 1945. As a result of his surrender Hitler sentenced him in absentia to death by hanging, and his family in Berlin (plus his wife and eldest daughter who were in Denmark), was arrested. 
They were released after the Surrender of the Wehrmacht. 
Lasch went into Soviet captivity and was routinely convicted as an alleged war criminal in the Soviet Union and sentenced to twenty-five years in a corrective labor camp in 1948. He was repatriated on 8 October 1955. 
Lasch authored So fiel Königsberg. Kampf und Untergang von Ostpreußens Hauptstadt, which was published in 1958. In 1965, he wrote Zuckerbrot und Peitsche about his years as a Soviet prisoner of war.


=== Russian captivity ===
Like so many others, Otto Lasch would become a POW of the Red Army. On 13 April 1945, thousands of Russian leaflets were dropped over German positions. They were signed by the now-prisoners of war General of the Infantry Lasch, Lieutenant General Hermann Haehnle, Colonel Hugo Eduard Wilhelm Freiherr von Süßkind-Schwendi (1903–1996), Colonel Kaspar August Völker (1894–1966), and others, including Colonel Kurt Erdmann-Degenhardt. The text read (although it cannot be assumed that participation was voluntary):

"To the German officers and soldiers! We have been given the opportunity to tell the German army and the German people the truth about the defeat at Königsberg. The German people and the German army must know the truth. On 6 April, the Russian troops began their attack on Königsberg. Over 100,000 soldiers of all branches were in the besieged city. The fortress was prepared for defense. Food supplies were sufficient for eight weeks. Nevertheless, Königsberg was captured by Russian troops as early as 9 April. We were forced to lay down our arms because further resistance was completely pointless. During these four days, we suffered enormous losses among officers, soldiers, and civilians. The heavy Russian bombing raids and the intense artillery and mortar fire quickly destroyed the fortifications and broke the soldiers' will to resist. Ammunition and food supplies were destroyed by Russian fire. Telephone and radio communications failed. There was no longer any way to care for the many wounded. White flags were raised by the civilian population. The people no longer wanted the fighting to continue. Königsberg fell due to the superiority of the Russian forces. It must be prevented that, like Königsberg, the rest of Germany is destroyed by the criminal actions of its government. The Russian troops have crossed the Oder; the British and American troops have reached the Elbe. The war is lost. Only surrender will prevent further needless sacrifices. Hitler and his regime, who have tormented the German people for so long, should perish, but the German people should live. [signed] Russian captivity, 13 April 1945."
