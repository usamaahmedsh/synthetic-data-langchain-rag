Der Emes (Yiddish: דער עמעס, IPA: [dɛr ˈɛməs], meaning 'The Truth'; from Hebrew אמת, emeth) was a Soviet newspaper in Yiddish. A continuation of the short-lived Di varhayt, Der Emes began publishing in Moscow on August 8, 1918. The publisher was the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Moishe Litvakov was its editor-in-chief from 1921 until his arrest in the fall of 1937; after that, the newspaper was headed by an anonymous "editorial board". From January 7, 1921, to March 1930 Der Emes appeared as the organ of the Central Bureau of Yevsektsiya. It declined in 1937.
