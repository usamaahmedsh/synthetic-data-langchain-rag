This article provides a comprehensive list of countries, dependencies, political and territorial entities, anarchist regions, Autonomous areas and provisional governments that existed for five years or less. These short-lived entities emerged and disappeared under a variety of circumstances. In some cases, newly established states were overthrown by coups (e.g., the Kingdom of Tunisia), while others were formed during failed revolutionary movements (e.g., the Democratic Republic of Yemen). Additionally, some entities were created as puppet states during wartime (e.g., Napoleon's Sister Republics) or existed as provisional governments (e.g., the Provisional Government of Hawaii). The diverse nature of these political formations reflects the complexity of state formation and dissolution in times of rapid political change.
