== Geography ==
Ried is situated in a hollow of the Alpine foothills, to the north of the Hausruck Forest (Hausruckwald). The name of the city is derived from the Middle High German "Riet" (also: Rieth, Reet, Rohr, and the like), which denotes the reed which grows along the shores of swamps. Ried im Innkreis is 433 m (1,421 ft) above sea level. It measures 3.2 km (2.0 mi) from the North to the South and 3.6 km (2.2 mi) from the East to the West and it is 6.7 km2 (2.6 sq mi) in area.

== History ==


=== Middle ages ===
Ried was first mentioned on 13 November 1136, as a castle of the Bavarian sovereign with the seat of the noble house of Ried. Already in 1180, the townsmen of Ried were first mentioned in records, indicating a settlement near the castle.
Legend has it that in 1191, Dietmar der Anhanger - a miller's son - obtained the market town of Ried as a fiefdom from Frederick I. (Barbarossa). Allegedly, Dietmar boosted the morale of the troops during the crusade: When the enemy had overthrown the flag of the army in Iconium, Dietmar took off his boot and put it onto a lance; under that sign, the crusaders took new courage and managed to conquer the city. The peasants' boot of this legend is now part of the city's coat of arms.
The line of the lords of Ried ended around 1200 and the Bavarian dukes took over the area. Ried was situated only one and a half hours by foot from the Austrian border at the Geiersberg, and this vicinity proved again and again to be disastrous to the market town of Ried.
In 1266, the Veste Ried was conquered by Ottokar II. Přemysl, and it was again conquered on 24 September 1364 by Rudolf IV. der Stifter and destroyed.
The First Treaty of Ried, negotiated in 1379, halted these border conflicts for the time being. In 1435, Ried obtained its own coat of arms from Duke Henry XVI of Bavaria.


=== Modern times ===
During the Reformation, several reports of ecclesiastic visitations verify the influence of the Reformation. But by 1580, the Counter-Reformation had been completed, which led many to emigrate. During the German Peasants' War, Ried was the asylum and headquarters of the Bavarian war commissioner.
In 1649, a plague epidemic reached the city and took 236 lives.
In the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) and in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1745), the border conflicts between Austria and Bavaria resurfaced. After the War of the Bavarian Succession, the Innviertel - including Ried - was ceded to Austria in the Treaty of Teschen 1779. During the Napoleonic Wars, it was temporarily returned to Bavaria in 1810. Napoleon spent the night in Ried twice and narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on 2 May 1809.
With the Treaty of Ried, Bavaria changed sides on 8 October 1813 and joined the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon. After the Treaty of Munich in 1816, Ried finally became Austrian.
As the largest market town of Austria at that time, Ried was granted its town charter by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1857. The "Gewerbliche Ausstellungsfest" (Commercial Exhibition Festival), held for the first time in 1867, formed the foundation for Ried's later position as a centre for exhibitions and trade fairs.


=== Contemporary history ===
On 12 March 1938 - the day of the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany - units of the German Wehrmacht marched into Ried; Hitler passed through the city on his way to Linz. At the end of World War II on 3 May 1945, American troops marched in and the city became part of the American occupation area in occupied Austria. The American military administration built a camp for members of the German military taken as prisoners of war. Besides the prisoner of war camp, a Displaced persons camp was also built. This camp was led by a member of the UNRRA and had the number 701A.

=== Coat of arms and flag ===
Ried's coat of arms was awarded together with the municipal charter in 1857. The coat of arms is divided into four parts: The upper quarter shows the double eagle and signifies the affiliation to Austria. The lower quarter contains the "Bavarian Wecken" - white-blue rhombuses - and indicates that the town originally belonged to Bavaria.
In the left quarter is the laced boot, which was also on the older coat of arms and refers to the founding legend of the city. The tendrils in the right quarter were also in the original coat of arms and refer to the importance of the city as a centre of brewing.
