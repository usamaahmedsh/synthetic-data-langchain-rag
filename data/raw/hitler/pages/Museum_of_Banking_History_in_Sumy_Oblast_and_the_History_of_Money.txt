The Museum of Banking history in the Sumy oblast and the History of Ukrainian Money (Ukrainian: Музей розвитку банківської справи на Сумщині та історії грошей) located at the State higher educational institution "Ukrainian Academy of Banking of the National Bank of Ukraine" in Sumy. Its address is Petropavlivska Str., 57, room number 304.


== History ==
The museum was founded in 2006 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the academy on the basis of a unique collection of Ukrainian bonds – the paper money out of circulation, which were given to the academy by the National Bank of Ukraine. The exposition of the bonds is arranged in the thematic-chronological order – from the first appearance of money to the present days. In addition to the numerous historical documents, photographs, metal money (coins, souvenir bars), commemorative medals of the National Bank of Ukraine there is an exhibition presenting technical appliances used in the banking industry in the late 20th century. The museum’s exhibition is regularly updated with new historical exhibits - photographs, securities, and personal paraphernalia of bankers.
