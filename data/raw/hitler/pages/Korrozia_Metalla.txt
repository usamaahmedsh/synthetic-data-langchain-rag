Korrozia Metalla (Коррозия Металла, [kɐˈrozijɐ mʲɪˈtalɐ], Russian for "Corrosion of metal",) is a Russian (formerly Soviet) thrash metal band led by Sergey "Pauk" Troitsky. It is best known for provocative public performances.


== Biography ==

Korrozia Metalla was founded in 1984 in Moscow by bass guitarist and vocalist Sergey Troitsky. The band's first live show was illegally carried out in an apartment house basement. Annoyed by their noise, the neighbours called the police, which forced Korrozia to leave the stage. Next year the band joined Moscow Rock Lab, which allowed the band to perform rock music legally. The band's first album, Orden Satany (Order of the Satan) was released in 1988. No Soviet state label was ready to release that kind of music, so Pauk created his own one, Hard Rock Corporation (HRC, Korporatsia Tyazhologo Roka, KTR, or КТР in Cyrillic). Before the album was recorded, Schizophrenic was fired and Boar performed vocals as well as guitar. Morgue was replaced by Yasher (Lizard).
In late Soviet years, censorship was lifted, and Korrozia Metalla became notorious for lyrics and imagery that, although consistent with western shock rock traditions, were quite provocative by Soviet Russia's measures. For their live shows, they employed strip girls to dance on stage and decorated it with pyrotechnics and "satanic" imagery. Similarly, the band's lyrics consisted of black humour and strong language, describing violence, supernatural and sex.
In the 1990s, Pauk eventually fired all the original line-up and both band's lyrics and live performances changed to a feigned affinity with fascism and neo-nazism. During the promotional tour for Computer Hitler album, band even employed world-famous politics and dictators impersonators for their extreme live shows. Pauk indicated his interest in politics when nominated himself for mayor of Moscow in 1993, and for mayor of Khimki in 2012. The band has long been a spoof of far-right politics; several of their songs have been banned and they are included in Russia's federal list of extremist materials in Russia for inciting inter-ethnic hatred.
The band's song Russian Vodka, was covered by Koldbrann and Aggressor.
At the beginning of 2016, due to the local law, Korrozia Metalla's discography was removed from iTunes and Google Play Music.
On 3 September 2016, Troitsky was arrested in Montenegro after the house he was staying at burned down and was facing a sentence of 5 years in prison, however Troitsky was sentenced to 10 months, of which he served 6.
On 28 April 2017, Troitsky returned to Russia and performed with Korrozia at the Mona Club, at a special concert called "Rock Against NATO".
On 29 April 2024 the band members were arrested during a live show in Nizhny Novgorod for displaying neo-Nazi symbols and selling neo-Nazi books and clothes, which is illegal in Russia. The band claimed, however, that they merely used "old Slavic symbols".
