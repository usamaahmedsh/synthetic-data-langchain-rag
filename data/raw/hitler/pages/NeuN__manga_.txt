NeuN is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tsutomu Takahashi. It was serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Weekly Young Magazine from May 2017 to February 2020, with its chapters collected in six tankōbon volumes.


== Synopsis ==
In 1940, SS members visit Brausteppe, a small village in southern Germany, and order the villagers to submit their residential files. However, the purpose of the visit was to kill all residents who had seen Franz Neun and his face. Thirteen children were artificially created to inherit Hitler's DNA, but twelve, including Neun, were deemed unnecessary. SS member Theo Becker, who was on the mission to escort Neun, goes against Major General Clausen, who was in charge of the raid, and blows up other members to carry out the initial mission of protecting Neun. After shooting Major General Clausen, Theo takes Neun with him on a journey to escape the Nazis.
