Since October 2023, the government of Israel has been accused of committing genocide against the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip by several countries across the world. The government of South Africa formally accused the country of genocide in December that year in a case before the International Court of Justice, with 14 countries joining on the side of South Africa by December the next year. Explicit state positions on the genocide include recognition, denial, or deferral to the ultimate result of the pending case. Some countries have been described as silent regarding the matter.
