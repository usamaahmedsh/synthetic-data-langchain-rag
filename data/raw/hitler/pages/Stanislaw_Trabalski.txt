From an interview with Beatrix Bouvier Wrede of 22 November 1973

Heinrich Fleissner warned against this risk was unt it really helps that the district board agreed to the merger date. Fleissner said that a party resolution was not to answer, because otherwise detained thousands of officials. The former camp had a very high mortality rate, so that was also uncertain whether the Funtionäre would ever come out alive again. [...].
