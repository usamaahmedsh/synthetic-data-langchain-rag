== Reaction ==
According to an interview with Creem magazine, George Harrison stated that he saw the play with Derek Taylor and greatly disliked it. He walked out while attending the London premiere and withdrew permission to use his song "Here Comes the Sun". It was replaced with "Good Day Sunshine".
After excerpts from the play were broadcast on BBC television, Paul McCartney criticised it for being biased against him and in favour of John Lennon, objecting in particular to the suggestion that it was McCartney and not Lennon who was responsible for the break-up of the Beatles. McCartney blocked a proposed film version of the musical.
