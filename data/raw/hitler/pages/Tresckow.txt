General and anti-Nazi conspirator Henning von Tresckow was one of the prime movers behind what led to the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler.

== Imitation of name and coat of arms ==
In the 19th century, a Dano-Norwegian family named Treschow, which is unrelated to the Tresckow family, adopted a coat of arms based upon that of the German Tresckow family. The name of the Dano-Norwegian family has a different etymology, being a corruption of the original Træskomager, meaning "wooden shoe-maker" in Danish/Norwegian.
