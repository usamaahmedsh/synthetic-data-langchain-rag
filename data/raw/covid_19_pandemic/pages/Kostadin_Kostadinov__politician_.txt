=== Controversy ===
Kostadinov has also expressed anti-Roma views, describing Roma people as "parasites" and "non-human vermin that has no place in Bulgaria".
In the summer of 2020, the Court in Sofia launched a procedure for the removal of "Revival" as a political party, on the grounds that it had been fraudulently established through gathering falsified signatures. However, in May 2021, the Supreme Court of Cassation ruled in favor of Kostadinov's party, establishing that there had been no irregularities. In September 2020, Kostadinov was detained by the police during the protests opposing chief prosecutor Ivan Geshev and Borisov's administration. His party has also been noted for its opposition to many of the pandemic control measures, the  promotion of conspiracy theories and having strong reservations regarding the COVID-19 vaccines. In March 2022, it was revealed that Kostadinov had received a 10-year ban from entering Ukraine, which has been attributed to the staunchly pro-Russian orientation of his party in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. His pro-Russian stance and activities had gained him the nickname 'Kopeikin', referring to his alleged ties and alleged financial support from the Russian government.
In January 2025, Kostadinov expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump's territorial claims on Canada and the Panama Canal.
