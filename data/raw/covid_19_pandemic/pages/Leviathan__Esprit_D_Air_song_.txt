"Leviathan" is a song by Japanese electronicore band Esprit D'Air, released on December 4, 2020, as a single from the Oceans album.
Leviathan was recorded during the pandemic in 2020. The song was producer and songwriter Kai's favorite song on the album, as he said when the album was released.


== Background and composition ==
It is the third track of the album, containing djent guitar riffs with melodic vocals and futuristic synthesizers layered on top.


== Chart performance ==
The single entered the Official Charts, peaking at #4 in the Physical Singles Chart, #10 in the Single Downloads Chart, #9 in the Single Sales Chart, and #10 in Singles Vinyl Chart.


== Lyrical meaning ==
The song, as Kai explained, "we interpreted 'Leviathan' as a huge power or impact beyond human power or knowledge. When we wrote this, we were thinking about how significantly our world has changed with the pandemic and how we can think positively and have hopes in tough times. Through our composition and songwriting, we tried to express lights of despair, human weakness and stupidity, and human wisdom to build a new world.


== Music videos ==
The song has two versions of music videos, both directed by Andy Mihov. The video tells the story of a post-apocalyptic world, ravaged by pandemics, where an AI seeks to break free from her abusive creator and help humankind.

== Reception ==
Loudwire premiered the music video on their website and listed 'Leviathan' in their '2022's Best Metal Songs' playlist on Spotify.
The song received praise from Ben Christo from The Sisters of Mercy, stating "It's a really unique blend of djent, industrial, electro, goth, emo, metal and much more. I love the dramatics and cinematic quality it has, with haunting, melancholy colors swooping betwixt the cruel, relentless jaws of the machine.", whilst Michael Falcore of The Birthday Massacre adds, "Wonderful song, feels like a modern day opera with heavy guitars set on fire! Melancholic and haunting, the vocals cut deep. A truly inspired song."
'Leviathan' was played on BBC Radio 1's Future Alternative show with Nels Hylton and Kerrang! Radio's Fresh Blood with Alex Baker. About 'Leviathan', Nels Hylton states, "Gargantuan, taking electronic-sounding elements and just layering it over some of the best guitar riffs I’ve heard in a minute.", whilst Alex Baker states, "Showcases how these guys have the ability to mix up so many flavors. It's proggy, cinematic, it's synthy, it's a bit DragonForce-y at times, a bit metal-y, but all the time, it's bloody great."
Whilst playing Leviathan, Ollie Winiberg (BBC Radio 1) also stated, "One of the most phenomenal guitar players I have seen in years, going by the name of Esprit D'Air." on his Heavy Hooks podcast.
Matthew Kiichi Heafy of Trivium played 'Leviathan' as an opening track on his Chaos Hour show on SiriusXM.
