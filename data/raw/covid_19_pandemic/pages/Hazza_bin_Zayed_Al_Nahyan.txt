=== Pandora Papers ===
The October 2021 leak of more than 11.9 million documents by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) mentioned Sheikh Hazza as one of the Emirati royals with offshore holdings. The former national security adviser of the UAE reportedly owned the H Hotel office tower at 1 Sheikh Zayed Road, which gave space to at least four companies that provided offshore clients with financial or company formation services. Amongst these firms was SFM Corporate Services that had its office in the building until 2017. The ICIJ report said that SFM provided its services to owners of at least 2,977 firms in the UAE, the British Virgin Islands and other offshore financial centres. It was also revealed that Sheikh Hazza had his own offshore companies outside the UAE. In 2016, an Emirati law firm, Hadef & Partners assisted Sheikh Hazza to incorporate a UAE Company named Loomington Investments Ltd. The report revealed that two other companies with same name in the British Virgin Islands and Seychelles were owned by Sheikh Hazza.
