It is the second-largest city in the county, behind Tacoma, and is a suburban bedroom community. Lakewood is adjacent to the McChord AFB portion of Joint Base Lewis–McChord, a major military installation for the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force.


== History ==
Lakewood was officially incorporated as a city on February 28, 1996, on the same day as Edgewood. It immediately became the second largest city in Pierce County and among the largest in the state. Three previous attempts to incorporate as a city had been rejected by voters in 1971, 1990, and 1994 before it was approved by a 20-point margin on March 14, 1995, within a smaller area. Historical names include Tacoma/Lakewood Center and Lakes District (this name was used by the U.S. Census in the 1970 and 1980 Census). Lakewood is home to the Clover Park School District, the Lakewood Water District, Fort Steilacoom Park and Western State Hospital, a regional state psychiatric hospital. Thornewood Castle was built in the vicinity of Tacoma in the area that is now Lakewood.
A small community near Arlington in Snohomish County with the name Lakewood had used the name for their post office since 1909, which led to confusion between the two areas. The United States Postal Service suggested that the new city be renamed due to frequent mixups in mail delivery that required the two post offices to forward deliveries with a one-day delay. The Snohomish County post office was renamed to North Lakewood in 1998 by the Postal Service due to the other community's unincorporated status.
In 1997, the Seafirst Bank robbery happened in Lakewood.
On November 29, 2009, four Lakewood Police Department officers were shot and killed at a coffee shop in Parkland by ex-convict Maurice Clemmons. All four officers had served with the department since its inception in 2004 and died at the scene; two baristas and several customers in the shop were not injured. Clemmons was shot and killed by a Seattle police officer two days later. The shooting is believed to be the most deadly attack on law enforcement in the state of Washington, and among the deadliest attacks on law enforcement in the United States.

=== Library ===
Lakewood is served by the Pierce County Library System, which has operated a public library in the area since it was annexed in 1996. An earlier library had been established in the community in February 1947 at a hobby shop in the Clover Park Shopping Center. It moved between various buildings, including the basement of a local school, while funds were collected by the Friends of the Lakes District Library for a permanent building. The Flora B. Tenzler Memorial Library opened on August 1, 1963, with donations from the Tenzler Foundation to cover the cost of construction and furnishings.
The Tenzler Library was expanded in 1974 with additional funds from the foundation and renamed to the Lakewood Library in 1982. The Pierce County Library System closed the branch in June 2022 after several building inspections had found substantial roof damage that would cost an estimated $22 million to repair. The Lakewood location had been one of the most-used in Pierce County prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. An interim Lakewood location opened in September 2024 after two years of lease negotiations; it cost $9.5 million to construct and includes 75,000 square feet (7,000 m2) of interior space. A permanent replacement is planned to be rebuilt on the same site as the original Lakewood Library at an unspecified date.
