The 33rd Annual Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards ceremony (officially titled "Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards 2020: Celebrate Together") was held virtually on May 2, 2020, with Victoria Justice serving as host. It aired on Nickelodeon and in a domestic simulcast with several other ViacomCBS cable networks, and also aired across all of Nickelodeon's international networks. The ceremony reached 2.4 million viewers.
The ceremony was held virtually due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and it was also the smallest-scale ceremony since 1987, when the first ceremony (titled The Big Ballot) aired as part of the existing series Rated K: For Kids by Kids. The ceremony was made up of pre-recorded award acceptances after voting, a performance from Asher Angel, and the first slime in space, inside the International Space Station. In addition, Nickelodeon presented a $1 million donation to No Kid Hungry in support of children and families affected by the pandemic.
In its originally planned form, the ceremony was to have been held at The Forum in Inglewood, California. Chance the Rapper was originally set to host, with Justin Bieber and Quavo performing their song "Intentions" (which they would later perform in the following year's ceremony). The ceremony was also originally scheduled to coincide with Nickelodeon's SlimeFest weekend of March 21–22, airing on March 22, which would have been the first time the ceremony had aired on a Sunday instead of its traditional Saturday night berth. On March 7, the outdoor aspects of SlimeFest were postponed to a future date due to public health concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, before the network cancelled the event as a whole. The ceremony itself was postponed four days after the SlimeFest postponement. The original timeslot of the ceremony instead contained a "best-of" compilation special.
A rerun of an episode of Danger Force led into the ceremony, while a rerun of an episode of Tyler Perry's Young Dylan served as the lead-out. The series finale of Henry Danger, "The Fate of Danger: Part II", was originally set to serve as the lead-in for the ceremony on March 22. Following the postponement of the ceremony, the Henry Danger finale instead aired on March 21 along with a new episode of Tyler Perry's Young Dylan and a new episode of All That.
