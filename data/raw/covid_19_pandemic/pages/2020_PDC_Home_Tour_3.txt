Each player will participate in three groups, resulting in 18 groups. The results of all 18 groups will form the combined league table.
The championship group will contain the top seven players of the league table. 
In all phases, each match will be a best of 7 legs match, with the winner of each match getting two points on the table. Should there be a tie on points after all the matches, the leg difference will determine positions, should that also be equal, the result between the two players is taken into account, following separated by legs won. Is there still no difference, the overall average of the players will then be taken into account.
