=== Feed - A- Kayayo ===
This project was established to support Kayayei (head porters) with food and accommodation during the lockdown period in other to curb wide spread of the corona virus.  This was done to cater for 8000 head porters of which 6000 were in Accra and 2000 were in Kumasi. The duration of the intervention was from  1 April 2020 to 12 April 2020. There was an extension of the support. The project was led by Julie Essiam  the Commission at GRA.


=== Ghana Infectious Disease Centre ===
The Ghana Infectious Disease Centre was built because the country did not have an infectious disease centre, so there was a need to build on through the use of the COVID-19 fund. On 21 August, the Ghana COVID-19 Private Sector Fund received GHS6.8 million from the Ghana COVID-19 National Trust Fund to contribute to the construction of the Ghana Infectious Disease Centre.
