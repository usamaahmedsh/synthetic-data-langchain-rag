== Background ==
"Panic" was the first single released from From Ashes to New's third studio album, Panic. The song was released on April 17, 2020, and accumulated over 1.5 million streams in under a month. The song features the same lineup as their prior album, The Future, something the band felt was a strength in their favor in recording, as the band had been through multiple difficult lineup changes prior. The band returned to working with music producer Colin Brittain on the track as well, because the band had been happy in working with on the prior album on the track "Nowhere to Run", and worked with producer Erik Ron, known for working with Godsmack, because they felt he would help the song's quiet-loud dynamic. A music video for the track was also release; production for it was very difficult due to it occurring during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Band member Matt Brandyberry described it as a "race against the clock" and a "The Book of Eli" type situation to make, with crew members constantly leaving in order to self-quarantine, and local restaurants and hotels closing down to the public. The video was just finished before the state of New York was shut down.
