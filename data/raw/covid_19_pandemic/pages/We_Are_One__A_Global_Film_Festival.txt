We Are One: A Global Film Festival is an international online film festival which took place in 2020. Organized by Tribeca Enterprises in conjunction with YouTube as a response to the cancellation of many traditional film festivals during the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival screened a selection of films for free on YouTube between May 29 and June 7.
The festival featured a mix of premieres of new films that had been slated to premiere at a film festival that was cancelled due to the pandemic, and older films which the partner festivals chose to highlight as deserving of wider attention, as well as a new film by Kōji Fukada that was created specifically for We Are One. In addition, the festival screened a number of virtual reality projects and some international television and web series episodes, selected panel discussions with filmmakers, and a live DJ set by Questlove.
Films were screened for free, although links were available to encourage voluntary donations to international COVID-19 relief funds.
