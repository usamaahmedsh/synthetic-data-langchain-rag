Global Pride was an online LGBT Pride event, which took place on June 27, 2020. Organized as a response to the international COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the cancellation of most traditional LGBTQ pride events due to social distancing restrictions on large public gatherings, the event featured livestreamed social and cultural programming organized by various LGBT community groups and pride committees around the world. According to a list maintained by the European Pride Organizers Association (EPOA), nearly 500 Pride events have been cancelled around the world.
According to InterPride executive Andrew Baker, "From a digital perspective, our community already has the tools to engage in periods of isolation like this. Our community is experiencing an opportunity to do that in more meaningful ways. Our community is also experiencing a bunch of reminders of why we have those skills."
