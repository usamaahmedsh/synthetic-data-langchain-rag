The COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine has resulted in 5,554,185 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 109,935 deaths.
The virus was confirmed to have spread to Ukraine when the country's first case was confirmed to be hospitalized in Chernivtsi Oblast on 3 March 2020, a man who had travelled from Italy to Romania by plane and then arrived in Ukraine by car. An emergency was declared on 20 March 2020 in Kyiv Oblast, Chernivtsi Oblast, Zhytomyr Oblast, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, and the city of Kyiv. New infections and deaths started to break records by late October 2021. By then, a total of 2.8 million coronavirus cases and 64,936 COVID-19 related deaths had occurred in Ukraine.
Ukraine's ongoing vaccination program started on 24 February 2021 and from that day to 12 September 2021, 10,710,944 vaccinations were given in Ukraine (meaning 18% of the adult population of Ukraine had been vaccinated against COVID-19). About 44% of those vaccinated had been fully vaccinated. In an August 2021 poll 56% of Ukrainians did not plan to be vaccinated. Demand for vaccinations multiplied sharply by late October 2021. On 7 January 2022 the Ministry of Health announced that 44.9% of the adult population had undergone a full course of vaccination.
Statistics for the Russian-held Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol, and for the unrecognized Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine, are not reported by Ukraine's state agencies, and are not included in the country's totals.
Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Ministry of Healthcare has made no further press releases related to COVID-19, and the latest counts were for 23 February 2022. As a result, daily counts are displayed in various diagrams as zero. In late May 2022, Chief State Sanitary Doctor Ihor Kuzin stated that since the beginning of the invasion, more than 750 studies had been conducted and that COVID-19 outbreaks were not expected in Ukraine in the near future. On 1 July 2023, the Ministry downgraded the disease's alert levels to that of regular respiratory diseases and lifted all emergency measures relating to it.

Unlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

== Vaccination ==

Vactination against COVID-19 in Ukraine started on 24 February 2021, but the tempo of vaccinating has been extremely slow compared to other European countries.
On August 30, 150,482 people were vaccinated against COVID-19: 50,690 people received a single dose, and 99,792 people their second. (The next month) in the week from 6 to 12 September, 921,443 vaccines were inoculated into Ukrainians (on 12September, 16,930 people received one dose and 28,218 people were fully immunized). This making the number of vaccinations given in Ukraine, since 24 February 2021,10,710,944. So 18% of the adult population of Ukraine had been vaccinated against COVID-19 by 13 September 2021. According to the official statistics of 6 September 2021, 7.6% of people over the age of 80 had received at least one dose of the vaccine, for people aged 40–59 this figure was slightly more than 19% and the most vaccinated group was people aged 18–19 years of whom 19.8% had received at least one dose of vaccine. On 14 October 2021 Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal stated that all of the country's adult population should be vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the year.
In August 2021 56% of Ukrainians polled by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation did not plan to be vaccinated. In the same poll 52% opposed mandatory vaccination against COVID-19. The same poll also revealed that 23% of those polled considered vaccination an effective means of protection against COVID-19. The most chosen effective methods of preventing coronavirus disease (according to the August 2021 polled Ukrainians) were "washing your hands after leaving the street" (54%), "keeping distance from others" (42%), "being attentive to their well-being and the health of others" (39%), and "wearing a mask" (36%).
Demand for vaccinations surged after new infections and deaths started to break records by late October 2021. From 15 to 21 October, almost 1 million people were inoculated in Ukraine. On 21 October 16% of Ukraine's population was inoculated. Making Ukraine still one of the least-vaccinated countries in Europe. On 23 October 2021 the Ministry of Health announced that 6.96 million Ukrainians had been fully vaccinated (out of a population of 41 million). An unknown number of Ukrainians had purchased an illegal fake COVID-19 vaccine certificate. (Sold from $20 to $200 with some costing as much as $380.) By 25 October (2021) 800 criminal cases for forged certificates or tests for coronavirus had been opened in Ukraine. Also on 25 October Ukrainian authorities reported a record daily high of 734 coronavirus-related deaths.
On 17 December 2021, the Ministry of Health announced that 46.1% of Ukrainian adults had received at least one shot of a coronavirus vaccine, while 41.3% of the adult population had completed their vaccination. Three days later the ministry stated that since the launch of the inoculation campaign 14,386,387 people had been vaccinated, of whom 14,386,385 received their first dose and 12,986,872 fully immunized (with two jabs).
On 7 January 2022, the Ministry of Health announced that 44.9% of the adult population had undergone a full course of vaccination.
By 18 January 2022, 131,178 Ukrainians had received a booster dose. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian vaccination program continued, although on a much smaller scale with 50–60 thousand people being vaccinated in a week by late May 2022. Vaccination continued in all regions of Ukraine, except in Luhansk and Donetsk Oblast.
On 19 September 2022 the Ministry of Health announced the offer a third dose of the vaccine to everyone four months after their previous injection.
