UNHhhh is an American comedy web series starring drag queens Trixie Mattel and Katya Zamolodchikova. In the series, Trixie and Katya discuss a topic humorously in front of a green screen. UNHhhh premiered on March 25, 2016, one year after Mattel and Zamolodchikova appeared in the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race. The show is aired through World Of Wonder's YouTube channel, as well as through its video-on-demand service WOW Presents Plus. UNHhhh has been nominated for ten Streamy Awards throughout its run, winning Unscripted Series at the 2020 ceremony, which the duo also hosted.


== Production ==
The show began in March 2016, and aired 65 episodes before World of Wonder announced the conclusion to the show and the premiere of The Trixie & Katya Show, a television spin-off on Viceland. The Trixie & Katya Show was canceled after one season and the series returned to YouTube for its third season in October 2018. Beginning with season three, new episodes would premiere on WOW Presents Plus uncensored the week before being released on YouTube. A fourth season aired from January 16 to September 12, 2019, with a special Christmas episode on December 11, 2019.
On September 20, 2019, Trixie Mattel uploaded a video on her personal Twitter account revealing that the series would return for a fifth season, which premiered on January 22, 2020. The series then went into a brief hiatus from March to August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Trixie and Katya Save the World airing as a replacement series during this time. On July 22, World of Wonder released a teaser on their YouTube page saying that UNHhhh would be returning on August 5 with new episodes filmed during the pandemic and some that were filmed before but not edited. To accommodate social distancing guidelines, Trixie and Katya were seated at a distance and filmed with multiple cameras, being edited to look closer together in the final cut. The season concluded on December 30, 2020 with the hosts confirming a sixth season would be produced which premiered on WOWPresents+ on April 21, 2021. Starting with season six, episodes were released on WOW Presents Plus one month before their YouTube debut. Season seven premiered on April 20, 2022, and was followed by season 8, which premiered on YouTube on April 19, 2023.
In the last episode of season 8, it was stated in the episodes description "UNHhhh yea... that's a wrap on season 8. While Trixie and Katya take a hiatus, relish in these random moments from the most recent topics. Stay subscribed and we'll see you again in 2024.". Despite this, season 9 was not released in 2024. 
On May 12, 2025, a copyright registration was filed by the producing company of the series. The filing of the copyright does not guarantee that UNHhhh season 9 will ever be released, and if released it may not be with the same format, nor featuring Trixie and Katya as in past seasons. In September 2025, Katya confirmed that there are no plans to make any further episodes as the duo wished to focus on other projects together. Katya confirmed it on Eric Sedeno's podcast.


== Format ==
The episodes span around 10–20 minutes in length on average and are produced in front of a green screen. Each episode covers one topic such as Beauty Tips or Colors, and features Trixie and Katya's brand of dark adult humor. The two drag queens often go on tangents in each episode, playing jokes off of one another. The use of the green screen results in edit-heavy episodes that add to the humor, with many moments or sound bites becoming memes and often quoted by fans. Each episode begins with the queens giving humorous intros, a trend started by Trixie Mattel in the second episode with "I'm market woman of the Serengeti, Trixie Mattel." The web series is heavily self-reflexive, with gags often repeating or being repeated on sister productions for Trixie and Katya, such as their podcast The Bald and the Beautiful.

=== Trixie and Katya Save the World ===
Trixie and Katya Save the World was created as a replacement for UNHhhh, which was on hiatus due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Filmed in the duo's homes over videochat, the show features the queens answering questions and attempting to solve the audience member's problems, in a vein similar to the "Asking For a Friend" bit from their Viceland series. The series premiered on March 30, 2020, exclusively on WOW Presents Plus, although the eighth episode was also released on YouTube.


==== Reception ====
Vice's Rachel Miller stated, "Trixie and Katya's show is actually my favorite part of all of this [RuPaul's Drag Race related fandom], and it totally stands alone; I'd recommend getting into it even if you don't watch Drag Race proper." The show was positively reviewed by Rachel Paulson of The Queer Creative podcast.
