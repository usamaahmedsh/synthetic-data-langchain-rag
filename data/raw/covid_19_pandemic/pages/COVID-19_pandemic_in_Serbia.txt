The COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia was an outbreak of the disease COVID-19 in Serbia caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Its first case in Serbia was reported on 6 March 2020, and confirmed by Minister of Health Zlatibor Lončar. The case was a 43-year-old man from Bačka Topola who had travelled to Budapest.
In late June 2020, the Balkan Insight published a report based on the allegedly leaked data from the internal Government COVID-19 information system. This report stated that in reality, Serbia had recorded 632 deaths due to COVID-19 in the period from 19 March to 1 June 2020, which corresponds to 388 additional deaths caused by the virus that were not publicly reported. Additionally, according to the leaked data, the number of people who became infected in Serbia from 17 June to 20 June was at least 300 per day, while public reports never accounted for more than 96 cases per day in the same period. The number of deaths was later shown to be underreported when the regular vital statistics data were published, revealing that in June 2020 alone, the number of COVID-19 deaths was 5.2 times higher than what was initially reported. Recovery figures were also disputed, with the Public Health Institute of Montenegro formally requesting an explanation from Serbian authorities in early June following a reported recovery of 4,000 patients in one day. Earlier, the index case was also disputed after the Public Health Institute publicly revealed that the first case was registered a week before the officially reported index case.
In September 2020, NIN weekly released research results that show a significant discrepancy between the data on the number of infected persons and the number of tests that were released by the Government during July and the data that was obtained from individual public health institutions through the freedom of information requests. The discrepancy shows that the Government released data inflated the number of tests that were conducted and that the number of infected persons was decreased by at least 59% during July.
Thousands of medical doctors have signed a petition requesting the release of true data and accountability for forging the data. Several senior department chiefs at Military Medical Academy were  dismissed after supporting the open letter. In August 2020 Professor Goran Belojević of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Medicine publicly stated that Serbia had registered 5,000 deaths.
On 29 September 2020, Predrag Kon, chief epidemiologist and a member of the state anti-COVID-19 Crisis Team, publicly admitted that there was a delay in data processing and that the number of deaths until the end of June was three times higher than officially reported (277). Health Minister refuted those claims the next day saying that they were "unfounded" and warned Kon against making such comments again.
As of 19 November 2022, 6,719,835 COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered in Serbia.


== Background ==

The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 was much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission was significantly higher, with a significant total death toll.

=== Social measures ===
The government implemented various social measures such as restrictions and lockdowns between March and July 2020.


==== March ====
On 15 March, a state of emergency was declared. Many argue the declaration was against the constitution, since there was no debate among the MPs in the Serbian Parliament. Some experts argue an emergency situation could have been declared instead, some saying that state of an emergency was an overreaction. All schools, kindergarten and universities were closed.
On 17 March, the distant lectures were introduced. All lectures for elementary schools were aired on RTS channel (RTS 3 channel) and the web platform RTS Planeta.
On 18 March, a curfew from (20:00) to (05:00) was established across the whole country. In addition, people of the age of 65 and above were forbidden to leave their homes, with fines up to din. 150,000 (approx. US$1,500). In the first hours of curfew, several people were arrested. One woman was forced to go home, after insulting police officers and refusing to comply with the measures of the curfew.
On 20 March, cafes, bars, shopping malls and public transportation were all shut down. Food delivery, however, remained allowed.
On 21 March, the curfew was prolonged from the previous 9 hours to 12 hours. People were ordered to stay at home from (17:00) to (05:00) the next day.

==== April ====
On 2 April, the new weekend curfew was established. Starting from (13:00) to (05:00) on Monday. Groups of no more than 2 people in public were allowed; however, this measure soon proved to be practically impossible to enforce.
On 8 April, the new weekend curfew was established. Starting from Friday on (17:00) up until Monday (05:00) in the morning. Senior citizens were allowed to go grocery shopping on Fridays from (04:00) to (07:00) in the morning.
On 17 April, the new weekend curfew before the Easter holiday (Julian calendar), was established. Starting from Friday at 17:00 to Tuesday at 05:00 in the morning.
On 18 April, it was announced that from Tuesday, 21. April, some restrictions would be lifted. Curfew was set to start from 18:00 instead from 17:00 lasting up until 05:00 in the morning the next day. Senior citizens can now choose when they want to take a 30 minutes walk from 18:00 to 01:00.
On 24 April, it was announced that the curfew would start from Friday, 24 April on 18:00 and last until Monday 27 April 5:00 in the morning. Public transportation between towns was about to be re-established. Senior citizens after 18:00, can now take a walk for a half an hour, no farther than 600 meters from their home address. Starting from next week, they can take walks for an hour instead of previous half. Starting from Monday, all the close spaced markets, beauty and cosmetic salons, fitness centres and gyms can now work.
On 26 April, due to 1st May holidays, new curfew was announced, starting from Thursday at 18:00 up until Monday to 05:00 (83 hours).
On 30 April, the previously announced curfew was reduced; the curfew was now supposed to last from Thursday at 18:00 until Saturday 05:00 (35 hours). People older than 65 can now take a walk two times on Friday during the curfew for an hour each time, whenever they like, while maintaining 600 meters the furthest distance from their residence.


==== May — July ====
On 6 May, the parliament dismissed previous its decision of state of emergency. Which meant from then on, no curfew was enforced. Though, measures of social distancing and wearing masks and gloves while using public transport remained. From 15 June, weddings can be held.
Since 1 June, mass events were allowed again. On 21 June, the 2020 Serbian parliamentary election took place – seven weeks later than planned before. On 26 June, new measures were imposed for Belgrade, from now on wearing masks was mandatory in closed spaces and in public transport. On 27 June, due to growing number of COVID-19 positives and packed hospitals with patients, new measures were taken for the south-western municipalities of Novi Pazar and Tutin. From then on, all the children playgrounds were closed, working hours of shops, markets, hair salons, bakeries, butcher shops were limited to no later than 19:00 UTC+1.
On 7 July, Aleksandar Vučić announced possible curfew between 18:00 and 06:00 from Friday to Monday. It was not clear if the curfew would affect only Belgrade or the whole country, though he emphasised he would like it to be across the country. This announcement sparked protests outside the parliament.


=== Economic measures ===
On 26 March 2020, employers can postpone paying taxes on suficit until 30 June. On 31 March, Vučić announced that all the small and medium-sized companies would receive help for the following 3 months to "survive" under the condition that they don't fire 10 percent of employees. All hairdressers shoemakers and bakers would receive a minimal wage (255.27€ as of January 2020) from the state. Every citizen older than 18, would receive 100 euros to support the spending and to support local businesses.
On 8 April, the Serbian government passed a decree on additional borrowing.
On 23 April, a previous decision to give every citizen 100 euros was revised, so than only pensioners and welfare users would receive the money, others interested in government's help, needed to inform the government if they want to receive the support from government. This decision was made, ostensibly because "some tycoons from the political area and outside were humiliated" with the previous decision to help every citizen older than 18, as they felt insulted with the amount.
