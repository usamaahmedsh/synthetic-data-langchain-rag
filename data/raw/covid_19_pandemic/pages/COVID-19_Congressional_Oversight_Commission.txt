The COVID-19 Congressional Oversight Commission (COC) is an oversight body in the United States created by the CARES Act. They will report to Congress every 30 days on how the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board manage the funds until September 30, 2025. These reports will assess:

The economic impact the disbursements have on the populace, financial markets, and financial institutions
The transparency of how the money is used
The long-term costs and benefits to taxpayers taking on loans made by the legislation

It will have five members, one member each appointed by the House Speaker (Nancy Pelosi), House Minority Leader (Kevin McCarthy), Senate Majority Leader (Mitch McConnell), Senate Minority Leader (Chuck Schumer), and the chair chosen jointly by the House Speaker and Senate Majority Leader. They need not be members of Congress. As of 18 May 2020, the chair remained vacant, as the House Speaker and Senate Majority Leader had not yet agreed. The current membership is:
