The Battle of Myin Thar was an engagement between the Myanmar SAC junta and anti-coup forces in the village of Myin Thar, Gangaw Township, Magway Region. 
Tatmadaw forces raided the village two days after the National Unity Government called for a "people's defensive war" against the military. Yaw militias armed with improvised black powder rifles and grenade launchers heavily resisted until heavy artillery forced them to withdraw.
Numerous civilians, including a 50-year-old paralyzed man, were massacred by the Tatmadaw.
