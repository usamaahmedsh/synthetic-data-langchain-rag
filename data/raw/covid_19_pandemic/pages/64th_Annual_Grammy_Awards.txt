The 64th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 3, 2022. It recognized the best recordings, compositions, and artists of the eligibility year, running from September 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021. The nominations were revealed via a virtual livestream on November 23, 2021. The performers for the ceremony were announced on March 15, 24, and 30, 2022. South African comedian Trevor Noah, who hosted the previous ceremony in 2021, returned as host. The ceremony's location marked the first time the Recording Academy switched host cities for a single ceremony. This also makes it the first Grammy Awards ceremony not to be held in either New York City or Los Angeles since the 15th Grammy Awards in 1973 when it was held at the Tennessee Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee. It marked the first time the telecast took place in Las Vegas.
Jon Batiste received the most nominations with eleven, followed by Doja Cat, H.E.R., and Justin Bieber with eight each. Batiste received the most awards with five, and won Album of the Year for We Are. Silk Sonic won Record of the Year and Song of the Year for "Leave the Door Open", and Olivia Rodrigo won Best New Artist. The ceremony was originally scheduled for January 31, 2022, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles; however, on January 5, 2022, the Recording Academy postponed the ceremony indefinitely due to health and safety concerns related to the COVID-19 Omicron variant. On January 18, 2022, the ceremony was rescheduled to April 3, 2022, and its location was moved to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, due to resultant scheduling conflicts with the Crypto.com Arena.


== Background ==
The nominations were announced during a virtual livestream on November 23, 2021, by Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr., alongside Jon Batiste, Billie Eilish, Finneas O'Connell, H.E.R., BTS, Måneskin, Tayla Parx, Carly Pearce, comedian Nate Bargatze, Recording Academy chair Tammy Hurt, and CBS Mornings anchor Gayle King. The academy announced Trevor Noah to return as the host of the ceremony.


=== Category changes ===
For the 2022 ceremony, the academy announced several changes for different categories and rules:

For the General Field, the number of nominees in each category was increased from eight to ten
Package Field, Notes Field, and Historical Field were renamed and consolidated to Package, Notes & Historical Field
Production, Non-Classical Field; Production, Immersive Field; and Production, Classical Field were renamed and consolidated to Production Field
Two categories, Best Global Music Performance and Best Música Urbana Album, were added, bringing the total number of categories to 86
Best Dance Recording was renamed Best Dance/Electronic Recording
For Album of the Year, all credited artists (including those featured), "songwriters of new material, producers, recording engineers, mixers, and mastering engineers are eligible" to be nominated and win the category as recipients
For Classical Field, singles became eligible for Best Orchestral Performance, Best Choral Performance, Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance, Best Classical Instrumental Solo, and Best Contemporary Classical Composition
For Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, the following rules were updated:
For albums consisting of pre-existing masters, up to two producers and two music supervisors will be nominated and/or awarded
For albums consisting of new recordings and principal artists with significant performances, up to three producers (or four in extraordinary circumstances) and two music supervisors will be nominated and/or awarded along with an engineer/mixer "who contributes greater than 50% playing time of newly recorded material"
For Music Film Field, music-related documentaries must contain at least 51% of "performance-based material or individual music videos that together create a visual album" while "films with fictional elements are eligible"
Another Technical Grammy Award was added and will be awarded to individuals who "dramatically pushed boundaries and made groundbreaking, important, outstanding, and influential contributions of technical excellence and innovation to the recording field"


=== Nomination changes ===
For the 2022 ceremony, the Recording Academy opted to eliminate its nomination review committees, which were previously responsible for determining the nominees of each category. Nominees would be solely decided based on votes from the Recording Academy.


=== Voting changes ===
For the 2022 ceremony and during both voting rounds, the number of categories members of the Recording Academy were allowed to vote in was reduced to ten, on top of the four major categories. The ten categories could belong to up to three different fields, including the genre fields. The changes were made to "help ensure the quality of voting".


=== Nomination withdrawals ===
Drake was initially announced as a nominee for Best Rap Performance (for "Way 2 Sexy") and Best Rap Album (for Certified Lover Boy), but withdrew from contention for both awards on December 6, 2021. The Recording Academy subsequently honored Drake's request and officially removed his nominations for both awards.


=== Postponement and relocation ===

The ceremony was originally scheduled to be held on January 31, 2022, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. On January 5, 2022, the Recording Academy postponed the ceremony indefinitely due to health and safety concerns related to the COVID-19 Omicron variant. With the Crypto.com Arena booked with sports games and concerts nearly every night through mid-April, the academy decided to switch the ceremony's location to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The MGM Grand Garden Arena hosted the Latin Grammy Awards for six years, including the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards in November 2021.

=== Premiere ceremony ===
The performers for the ceremony were announced on March 25, 2022.


=== Main ceremony ===

== Ukraine tribute ==
A tribute to victims of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was featured with a performance of "Go Down Moses". Prior to the performance, a short video of Volodymyr Zelenskyy concerning the circumstances of warfare and military activity in Ukraine was played. Zelenskyy's appearance was seen by some as a way to make up for the rejection of the similar idea during the 94th Academy Awards the week before.


== In Memoriam ==
The In Memoriam segment was introduced by host Trevor Noah, with Cynthia Erivo, Ben Platt, Leslie Odom Jr., and Rachel Zegler performing multiple songs by American composer Stephen Sondheim during the segment, including "Somewhere" (from West Side Story), "Send in the Clowns" (from A Little Night Music), and "Not a Day Goes By" (from Merrily We Roll Along).
