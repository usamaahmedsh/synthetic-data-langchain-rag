== Critical reception ==

=== Synopsis ===
The video opens with Welch in a club with what NME describes as "Great Gatsby-esque official visuals", breathing heavily, with her hair in a Roaring Twenties-Esque hairstyle. She dances around the club, trying to get people seated at tables to speak to her, but all of them are frozen and unresponsive. In another shot, they are seen standing up, frozen. Welch runs through the crowd with her hair slightly unruly, trying to get a response, but is unable to do so. Later, she is shown on an elevated platform, singing while dancers dance around her. At this point, her hair is completely disheveled. One by one, the dancers collapse, with Welch finally following them. One final shot shows Welch in the silent club, breathing heavily once more.
