United Nations Security Council resolution 1308, adopted unanimously on 17 July 2000, was the first resolution to address the impact of HIV/AIDS worldwide. The Security Council asked countries to consider voluntary HIV/AIDS testing and counselling for troops deployed in peacekeeping operations.
Speaking after the unanimous adoption of the United States-sponsored resolution, the American ambassador Richard Holbrooke thanked Security Council members for the "unprecedented resolution on a health issue–the first in the history of the Security Council."

=== Observations ===
The security council was concerned about the HIV/AIDS pandemic worldwide, and especially the severity of the crisis in Africa. The UN General Assembly and the UN Economic and Social Council had an important role and there was a need for a co-ordinated effort to address the diseases. The spread of HIV/AIDS had a heavy impact on society, was exacerbated by violence, and could lead to instability and emergency situations if left unchecked. Therefore, a co-ordinated international response was important.
The council also recognised the need to include HIV/AIDS prevention and advice in United Nations peacekeeping missions. It welcomed the 13th International AIDS Conference held in South Africa, the first event of its type to be held in a developing country. Furthermore, it also took note of the Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call to reduce HIV/AIDS infection rates in 15- to 24-year-olds by 25% by 2010.


=== Acts ===
The resolution expressed concern at the impact of HIV/AIDS on international peacekeeping and support personnel. It acknowledged efforts by certain countries to address the issue through national programmes and encouraged those that had not yet done so to co-operate with the international community and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to develop long-term strategies to address the spread of the diseases. The Secretary-General was asked to take further steps in the training of peacekeepers to prevent the diseases.
UNAIDS was encouraged to strengthen cooperation with Member States. The council concluded by expressing an interest in making progress on the issue of access to treatment and care and prevention through discussions with countries, United Nations bodies, international organisations, and industry.
