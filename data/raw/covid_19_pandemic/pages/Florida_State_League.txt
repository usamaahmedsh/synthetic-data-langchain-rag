The Florida State League (FSL) is a Minor League Baseball league based in the state of Florida. Having been classified at various levels throughout its existence, it operated at Class A-Advanced from 1990 until its demotion to Single-A following Major League Baseball's 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues. The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the Low-A Southeast before reassuming its original moniker in 2022.
Each league member is affiliated with a Major League Baseball (MLB) team, and most play in their affiliate's spring training facility.


== History ==
The league originated in 1919 with teams in Bartow (Bartow Polkers), Bradenton (Bradenton Growers), Lakeland (Lakeland Highlanders), Orlando (Orlando Caps), Sanford (Sanford Celeryfeds), and Tampa, Florida (Tampa Smokers). The league closed down in 1928 and resumed play in 1936. It has continued uninterrupted, except for a four-year (1942–1945) suspension during World War II.
Initially, the FSL was classified as a Class D circuit, roughly equivalent to a Rookie-level league today. It was elevated to Class C from 1921 to 1924, roughly equivalent to an Advanced Rookie league in the pre-2021 classification system and a Rookie-level league today. It reverted to Class D from 1925 to 1928. The league went dormant from 1929 to 1935 but was revived as a Class D circuit from 1936 to 1941. After another period of inactivity from 1942 to 1945, it continued at Class D from 1946 to 1962. 
When the minor leagues were reconfigured in 1963, the FSL was reclassified as a Class A league, placing it three steps below the majors. There it continued until the next reorganization in 1990 when it was elevated to Class A-Advanced, remaining at the third rung on the minor league ladder. 
The championship series' first cancellation was in 2001, when playoffs were canceled after the September 11 attacks. Afterwards, the 2004 playoffs were canceled due to the threat of Hurricane Ivan. Years later, the 2017 FSL Championship finals were canceled on September 5, due to the threat of Hurricane Irma. The winners of the division series playoff games were named co-champions. This marked the third time since 2000 that the championship series game was canceled. In 2019, the end of the season and playoffs were cancelled due to the threat of Hurricane Dorian.
The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball's 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Florida State League was demoted to Single-A, four rungs below the majors, and temporarily renamed the "Low-A Southeast" for the 2021 season. Following MLB's acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the Low-A Southeast was renamed the Florida State League effective with the 2022 season.
