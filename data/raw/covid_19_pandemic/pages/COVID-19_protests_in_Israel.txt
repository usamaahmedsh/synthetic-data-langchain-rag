Protests over COVID-19 policies in Israel refer to the series of protests by various social and political groups since April 2020. The protests are opposing lockdowns, mandatory vaccines, government restriction policies and vaccinations in general. The protests coincided with similar demonstrations and riots worldwide, though some of the earlier protests were linked to the specific 2019–2021 Israeli political crisis.
From August 2021, the protests began organizing into a more cohesive structure, aligning several previously separate movements. From December 2021, the protests epicenter moved from Tel Aviv to the city of Raanana, the place of Prime Minister's residence.


== Background ==

In the summer of 2020 during mass demonstrations in front of the Prime Minister's official residence, the Israeli police used the kettling tactic several times and prevented demonstrators wishing to leave the demonstration compound from leaving. Criticism had been leveled at the fact that the tactic is used to deter protesters from reaching the protest and due to the dangerous high-density it creates in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The protests against Benjamin Netanyahu concluded after the thirty-sixth government of Israel, headed by Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid in a power-sharing agreement, was sworn in on 13 June 2021, ending Netanyahu's 12-year second tenure as prime minister. However, protests against the new government's handling of the pandemic soon followed.
