Latvia has been the first country to do so on 31 August, joined soon by Lithuania and Estonia. The list included President Lukashenko and all Central Election Committee members as well as other senior state official and security forces commanders.
The Baltic states were later followed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, Switzerland and New Zealand. These countries have sanctioned various numbers of Belarusian officials "for their roles in the fraudulent August 9, 2020 Belarus presidential election or the subsequent violent crackdown on peaceful protesters" or under similar motivations.
More sanctions against Belarusian individuals and entities followed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine; some of them were introduced due to Belarus's role in it. The European Union, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada expanded their existing sanction packages, while Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Ukraine introduced their sanctions. Some of the invasion-related sanctions against Belarusian individuals and entities are listed in the 'Russian' sanctions lists of these countries.

== Circumvention of sanctions ==
In 2020 and 2021, Belarusian authorities made various efforts to circumvent the Western sanctions. They also hid the statistics to prevent revealing the ways used to circumvent them and track their effects. In particular, access to data regarding production and exports of the sanctioned goods became restricted to public. In October 2021, Belstat started to hide data regarding exports of tractors and trucks. Overall classified exports in January–August 2021 is estimated at US$8.2 billion. In September 2021, Alexander Lukashenko mentioned minister of industry Petr Parkhomchik and vice prime minister Yuriy Nazarov as the people who organized the circumvention of sanctions. He also accused several workers of state factories of gathering information about the ways used to circumvent the sanctions, and he threatened them with imprisonment. 13 workers from Grodno Azot fertilizer factory, Naftan oil refinery, BMZ steel mill and Belarusian Railway were arrested by the Belarusian KGB in a possible connection with this statement. It was reported that some of them were accused of state treason. At least two of them were later released.
Shareholder structure of several companies was changed in order to take the subsidiary companies out from the restrictions. It was suggested that companies related to Lukashenko's deputy businessperson Mikalai Varabei were used to bypass the sanctions in the petroleum sector of industry. Polisch political scientist Piotr Żochowski suggested that the authorities will redirect their exports "through a chain of intermediaries in other countries", thus partially circumventing the sanctions.
Some Western companies helped Belarusian authorities to avoid sanctions or lobbied their lifting. In October 2021, director of the state-owned BMZ steel mill boasted that his factory wasn't sanctioned "due to certain actions taken by BMZ clients". In October 2021, Belgian authorities showed interest in easing of sanctions against Belarusian potash industry. It was later revealed that Belgian chemical company Tessenderlo Group lobbied this initiative.
Journalists uncovered ways of circumventing the sanctions against the Belarusian Steel Works, Belaruskali, BelAZ, Dana Holdings, Grodno Azot, Integral, Naftan, Aliaksei Aleksin, Mikhail Gutseriev, Aliaksandr Shakutsin, Mikalai Varabei and Aliaksandr Zaitsau, among others.
