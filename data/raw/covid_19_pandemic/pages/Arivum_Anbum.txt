Music director Ghibran said, "One day, Kamal Haasan and I got talking. It was his idea to come up with an anthem about how the world would function post the coronavirus crisis. He suggested that I compose a tune and he would pen the lyrics for the same." Kamal Haasan asked two-three days time to write the lyrics but ended up giving it in just three hours.
Ghibran revealed, "We started with Kamal sir’s portion and recorded lines with other singers. The toughest part of the song lies in the chorus. I launched a talent hunt of sorts and chose 37 aspiring singers to sing the chorus. Co-ordinating with them made the whole process interesting and challenging."
