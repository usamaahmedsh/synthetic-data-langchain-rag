== Background ==
Kashan Admani, a Pakistani producer, composer, and guitarist, initiated the project of "a song that would be a united prayer" during the COVID-19 pandemic. The song was created to inspire hope to the global population affected by COVID-19. Admani said in an interview with Arab News: "The idea was to talk about global unity in fighting the pandemic and praying to God for help. That's the reason why it's called 'We Are One', 'Aae Khuda'".
Each artist recorded their audio and video parts in home studios or recording facilities and sent them to Admani, who mixed the final track in his studio, Dream Station Productions. The Urdu poetry of Aae Khuda was written by Sabir Zafar, while the English poetry was written by Babar Sheikh.
