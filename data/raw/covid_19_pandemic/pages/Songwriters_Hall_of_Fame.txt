The Songwriters Hall of Fame (SHOF) is an American institution founded in 1969 by songwriter Johnny Mercer, music publisher/songwriter Abe Olman, and publisher/executive Howie Richmond to honor those whose work preserves and advances the heritage of English-language popular music. In addition to celebrating renowned songwriters, the organization supports the development of new songwriting talent through workshops, showcases, and scholarships. Nile Rodgers, since 2018, has been Chairman.


== History ==


=== Founding and early years (1969–1990s) ===
The Hall of Fame was established in 1969 by Mercer, Olman, and Richmond. During its early decades, the organization focused 
primarily on recognizing influential songwriters and songwriting teams across popular music genres.


=== Exhibits and public presence ===
An exhibit dedicated to the SHOF was launched in 2010 at the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live in Los Angeles. The Hall has no permanent physical home, and because its annual awards ceremonies are not televised, there is no other publicly accessible recording of the events for posterity.


=== Inductees ===
List of Songwriters Hall of Fame inductees
Numerous collaborating songwriters have been inducted together, with each member considered a separate entrant. The inaugural class in 1969 included 120 inductees, including several professional partnerships such as Rodgers and Hammerstein. Later inductees have included songwriting teams such as Burt Bacharach and Hal David (1972), Betty Comden and Adolph Green (1980), and Leiber and Stoller (1985). Individual inductees have included John Lennon and Paul McCartney (1987), members of Holland-Dozier-Holland (1988), Elton John and Bernie Taupin (1992), and all three members of the 
Bee Gees (1994). John Denver was inducted in 1996. Queen became the first rock band to have all its members inducted in 2003. Five members of Earth, Wind & Fire were honored in 2010, and four members of Kool and the Gang were inducted in 2018. Through 2019, 461 individuals had been inducted.


=== Recent events (2000s–present) ===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Songwriters Hall of Fame induction ceremony was postponed until 2022. SHOF president and CEO Linda Moran stated that the postponement was made to allow the event to take place with proper celebration. The 2020 class includes Mariah Carey, Chad Hugo, the Isley Brothers, Annie Lennox, Steve Miller, Rick Nowels, William "Mickey" Stevenson, Dave Stewart, and Pharrell Williams. Awards for that year will honor 
Jody Gerson (Abe Olman Publisher Award) and Paul Williams (Johnny Mercer Award). On March 8, 2022, the ceremony was officially announced for June 16, 2022, at the Marriott Marquis in New York’s Times Square.
