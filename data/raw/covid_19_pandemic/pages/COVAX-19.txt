== History ==
Vaxine began work on a COVID-19 vaccine in January 2020. After developing a vaccine adjuvant the company decided to focus on a "recombinant protein-based vaccine". A phase 1 human trial started in June 2020. The phase 1 trial involved 40 participants, 30 of whom received the vaccine. The remaining ten participants received a saline placebo.
Phases 2 and 3 clinical trials of COVAX-19 are being conducted in Iran under a co-operation agreement. Phase 2 clinical trials started in May 2021 and Phase 3 trials commenced in August 2021. In the phase 2 trials, 400 Iranian volunteers were injected with either a placebo or the first dose of the vaccine. If the studies are successful,  Cinnagen will produce the vaccine under the name SpikoGen in Iran.
