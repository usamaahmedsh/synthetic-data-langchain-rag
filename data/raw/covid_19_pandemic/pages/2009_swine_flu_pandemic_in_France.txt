The 2009 flu pandemic, involving an outbreak of a new strain of influenza commonly known as swine flu (usually referred as grippe A or grippe porcine in French), reached France in early May 2009.
In order to respond to flu epidemics in France, the government has a "national plan", which is also applied for this flu pandemic. In this plan, the different phases of the flu, which are slightly different from the World Health Organization phases, are detailed.


== Organisations involved in France ==
The High Council of Public Health (Haut Conseil de la Sante Publique - www.hcsp.fr) issues recommendations that are taken into account by the government in its decisions.
The Institut national de veille sanitaire (National Institute for Sanitary Watch) is the body in charge of following the health situation in France. It issues a daily digest of the situation. It also issues the official French definition of cases: possible cases, probable cases, confirmed cases, excluded cases.
The Groupes Régionaux d'Observation de la Grippe - GROG (Regional Flu Observational Groups) is a network of doctors in France created in 1984 who shares information about the number of cases and evolution of symptoms for the seasonal flues. They issues a weekly bulletin, available on internet.
The Réseau Sentinelles (Sentinelles Network) is another network of doctors in France created in 1984, they issues weekly updates (available in English) and have some historical information about the flu incidence in France.


== Government reaction to the flu ==
A governmental web site has been created to inform the population of the dangers and good practices to avoid the spread of the disease.
The French government lags behind the decision of the World Health Organization to upgrade to phase 6. It is currently in phase 5A in France.
A mandatory mass vaccination plan has been discussed. This vaccination plan is currently implemented, it is free and not mandatory.
In July 2010, France initially ordered 1,46 doses per inhabitant, the third largest amount among members of the Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI), behind the United Kingdom and Canada. In January, 50 million of the initial 94 million doses were cancelled.
