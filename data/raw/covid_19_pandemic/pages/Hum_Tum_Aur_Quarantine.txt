Bharti Singh told Mumbai Mirror online, "With everyone sitting at home during the lockdown and finding new ways of entertaining themselves, we thought it was the best time to put our talent to use. The series has short gags that will focus on fun activities during our lockdown. It is entirely shot by Haarsh and myself from home. We also want to tell everyone to stay indoors, stay safe and enjoy our new series."
