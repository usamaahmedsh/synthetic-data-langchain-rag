Touch (also known as touch football or touch rugby league) is a variant of rugby league that is conducted under the direction of the Federation of International Touch (FIT). Though it shares similarities and history with rugby league, it is recognised as a sport in its own right due to its differences which have been developed over the sport's lifetime.
Touch is a variation of rugby league with the tackling of opposing players replaced by a touch. As touches must be made with minimal force, touch is therefore considered a limited-contact sport. The original basic rules of touch were established in the 1960s by members of the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club in Sydney, Australia.
Distinctive features of touch include the ease of learning it, minimal equipment requirements, ability to play it without fear of major injury, and the regularity of males and females playing together, and as such it is often played either as alternative to or as a soft introduction to full-blown rugby football.  While it is generally played with two teams of six on-field players, some social competitions allow a different number of players per team on the field. It is played by both sexes, and in age divisions from primary school children to over-60s. The mixed version of the sport (where both male and female players are on the field at the same time) is particularly popular with social players but is also played at an International representative level.


== History ==


=== Origins ===

While it is often claimed that Touch started in Australia in 1963 as a social or "park" game and as a training technique for rugby league, at least as early as 1956, supervised "touch and pass" was already being played at several inner city schools in the North of England, where asphalt playgrounds made normal rugby league too dangerous. Although the rules were set out by the schools' sports teachers, it was not then viewed as a sport in its own right.
Touch was formalised into a sport proper by the "Founders of Touch", Bob Dyke and Ray Vawdon of the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club. On 13 July 1968 an organisation known as the South Sydney Touch Football Club was formed and the sport of Touch Football was officially born. The first official Touch match was played in late 1968 and the first official competition, organised by Dyke & Vawdon, was held at Rowland Park Sydney in 1968.
From its formal inception in 1968, the game quickly became a fully regulated and codified sport in Australia. Originally played under lightly modified rugby league laws to remove hard physical contact, the sport has since evolved under its own specific rules now quite varied from its rugby league roots. The reduction of field size to half that of a rugby league field in particular aided the sports rapid growth across Australian rugby league stronghold areas as it allowed greater participating in the same geographic footprint.
The sport was first played in Brisbane, Australia in 1972 and by 1973 there were representative matches between sides representing the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales. It had spread to New Zealand by 1975 and in 1978 the first national body, the Australian Touch Football Association (ATFA), now Touch Football Australia (TFA) was formed. The sports first national representative event, the Australian National Championships, was held on the Gold Coast, Queensland in 1980.
The ATFA dropped the word "Football" from its name in 1981, becoming the Australian Touch Association or ATA and thereby changing the sports name to simply Touch. In the same year, the ATA published the sports first formal set of playing rules.
The first international match was played between Australia and New Zealand in Melbourne in 1985, leading to the creation of the Federation of International Touch and the formulation of the sports first set of global rules based on the playing rules in use by the ATA at the time.


== Rules and equipment ==


=== Rules ===
The current rules are based on the 8th Edition published by the Australian governing body, Touch Football Australia, in 2020. The updated rules were subsequently adopted by FIT as the FIT 5th Edition Playing Rules. The rules include a section of touch-specific terms and phrases, many of which are shared with rugby league (e.g. offside, intercept, try).


=== Playing field ===
Touch is played on a grass, rectangular field measuring 70 x 50 metres (i.e. slightly larger than one half of a rugby league field). As kicking is not allowed, goal posts are not required.


=== Ball ===
Touch balls are oval and slightly smaller than rugby league balls. The official size is 36 cm long and 55 cm in circumference, also sometimes known as rugby size 4.


=== Clothing ===
Players typically wear light clothing such as singlets, T-shirts or polo shirts and shorts. All shirts must be numbered. Women generally wear lycra bike shorts, athletic briefs or swimsuit-style lycra bodysuits. Head caps or visors are also commonly worn on the touch field by players and officials.


=== Footwear ===
Players normally wear soft rubber cleated shoes, similar to those used in other grass sports such as cricket and field hockey. Screw-in cleats are strictly prohibited, though moulded-sole football boots may be worn.


=== Referee ===

Touch must have at least one referee to manage a match but most major matches feature a team of three referees alternating between a controlling referee and two sideline referees throughout the match.


=== Positions ===
Teams are generally split into three positions: two "wings" (the players on either edge of the field i.e. 'right wing' and 'left wing'); two "middles" (the central players); and two "links" (the players between the wings and middles, one on each side of the field i.e. 'right link' and 'left link').


=== Half ===
The half (formerly known as the acting half or dummy half) is subject to a number of restrictions that do not apply to other players:

If the half is touched with the ball, the attacking team loses possession.
The half cannot score a try. Attempting to do so (even grounding the ball not purposefully) results in a change of possession.
These restrictions do not apply to a Half who passes the ball to a teammate (or indeed opposition player) and then receives it back.
At a rollball, if the Half takes too long to retrieve the ball, or is further than 1m away from the position of the rollball, defenders are allowed to move forward before the Half has touched the ball.


=== Mode of play ===
The ball can be passed or knocked (but not kicked) sideways or backwards between teammates (known as Attackers), who attempt to evade opposition players (known as Defenders) to score a Try.


=== Possession ===
A team normally retains possession for a set of six consecutive touches (as in rugby league), after which possession transfers to the opposing team. This is known as a Change of Possession, (or more informally Turnover). This can occur after six touches are completed, if the ball is dropped by the attacking team, or if the attacking team is penalised by the referee for infringing the playing rules.


=== Scoring ===
A Try (formerly Touchdown) is awarded when an attacking player, who is not the Half places the ball on or over the opposition's try line. Each Try is worth one point, though some mixed social competitions award female players two points in order to encourage ball sharing.


=== Interchanges ===
Players may interchange an unlimited number of times throughout the match provided the team does not exceed the maximum number of on-field players allowed, which is usually six under standard FIT rules.
The match remains continuous and does not stop to allow interchanges.
Players coming onto the field must wait until the player they are interchanging with has left the field and entered the designated Interchange Area. Failing to do so can result in the referee awarding a penalty for an incorrect interchange.
Players in a team who are not on the field must remain inside their allocated Interchange Area (sometimes called substitution box) until they enter the field.


=== Composition of teams ===
Teams can consist of all male players (Men's and Boys competitions), all female players (Women's or Girls competitions), or a combination of both (Mixed competitions).
Under standard FIT rules, each team can consist of up to 14 players, of which up to six players can be on the field at any one time.
Mixed teams typically comprise three females and three males on the field at one time. Under standard FIT rules, there must be at least one male and one female, and no more than three males on the field at any time.


=== Match duration ===
The standard match duration is 40 minutes (two x 20-minute halves) with a 5-minute halftime, though other time frames are often used to suit local conditions and competitions.


== World Rugby ==
World Rugby, the international governing body of the rules of rugby union, published in November 2010 a draft of leisure rules of Touch Rugby IRB for developmental purposes. Those Laws were adapted from the FIT playing rules for the sport of Touch.
The document states: "Council agreed that these Leisure Rugby Laws are issued as a guide for developmental purposes and Unions are not bound to apply the Laws" and "IRB Leisure Rugby Laws have been designed so that Unions may develop non-Contact Rugby. These Laws have been produced so that there are some guidelines and principles in place for IRB Leisure Rugby. Unions having jurisdiction over their developmental processes, matches, competitions and festivals may need to vary these Laws as deemed appropriate. This allows domestic Rugby clubs to adapt to the FIT playing rules, provided domestic Touch Associations are in agreeance."
The leisure rugby laws released by World Rugby are not supported or recognised by the Federation of International Touch.

== Touch worldwide ==


=== Australia ===

Touch is played in every Australian state and territory, and is particularly popular in the rugby league and rugby union strongholds of Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT. There are currently over 700,000 registered Touch players, 500,000 school children, and up to 100,000 casual players playing the sport. The peak governing body was formed in 1978 as the Australian Touch Football Association. In 1981 the word "football" was dropped from the name and the organisation became the Australian Touch Association. After a restructure and merger of the national body with the state-level governing bodies (except the Queensland and New South Wales associations) in 2004, the word "football" was re-incorporated into the organisations new name - Touch Football Australia.
From 1997 until 2018, Australia's main domestic competition was the National Touch League (NTL). Thirteen permits, representing all parts of Australia, compete in open-age, under-20 and over-age (Masters) divisions in men's, women's and mixed categories. The permits were originally designed to equalise competition between the traditionally strong Touch states of Queensland and NSW, and the remainder of the country. The Elite 8 series, an additional competition played at the same time as the NTL, was created in 2013 to provide a further elite domestic level to the sport. As a result, the 20 Years & Under division for that year's NTL was removed. The Elite 8 was eventually replaced in 2018 by the NRL Touch Premiership though the NTL continues.
A youth version of the National Touch League, formerly known as the National 18's and now known as the National Youth Championships, is held annually. The original National 18's event included only an 18 Years & Under division but was expanded and renamed in 2013 to accommodate the 20 Years & Under division after it was removed from the NTL as a result of the Elite 8 Series. The 20 Years & Under division reverted back to the NTL in 2014 where it has remained since. The event has simultaneously been held with the National Schools Cup, an event featuring the best school-based teams from each state. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic affected National Youth Championships was run simultaneously with the Queensland Junior State Championships to expand the event to include 12 Years & Under, 14 Years & Under, and 16 Years & Under, a format which was further expanded in 2021 when entry to those age divisions was opened to teams from outside of Queensland.
The first state of origin series between the stronghold states of Queensland and New South Wales was played in Port Macquarie, New South Wales in 1995 and has been played every two years since. The series originally featured a single Men's and Women's divisions, but was expanded in 1999 to include a Mixed division, and age-restricted divisions.
School Sport Australia conducts an annual National Championships, which includes division for both Primary School (Under 12) and Middle School (Under 15) sides. The location of the event rotates between states each year, and most Australian States and Territories enter Boys and Girls teams in every division.
Touch Football Australia (TFA) and the National Rugby League (NRL) signed a memorandum of understanding in August 2013, bringing the two entities together to form a partnership to develop the sport across both codes. The agreement recognised the similarities between both Touch and Rugby league and that the significant benefits to both through a dual-track pathway. The agreement resulted in the creation of a unified "NRL Touch Football" brand in Australia, which resulted in a major profile and funding boost for the sport within the country, including the signing of a commercial partnership agreement between the two entities and the principle "whole of game sponsor", initially Harvey Norman and later Doordash.
In May 2018, under the NRL Touch Football partnership, the organisation launched the NRL Touch Premiership, a domestic home and away series played as curtain raisers to NRL matches. The initial teams were drawn from the Elite 8 Series and aligned to NRL clubs.
