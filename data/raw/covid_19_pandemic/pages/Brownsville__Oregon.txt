== History ==


=== Establishment ===
Brownsville was originally known as "Calapooya" after the area's original inhabitants, the Kalapuya Native People, or "Kirk's Ferry", after the ferry operated across the Calapooia River by early settlers Alexander and Sarah Kirk.  When Linn County was created from the southern portion of Champoeg County on December 28, 1847, the Provisional Legislature named Calapooia as the county seat. The Spaulding School in Brownsville served as the original county courthouse. Brownsville was named in honor of Hugh L. Brown, who settled there in 1846 and opened the first store.
In 1851, the Territorial Legislature passed an act establishing Albany as the county seat. A special election in 1856 reaffirmed Albany as the county seat.


=== Stand by Me ===
In the mid-1980s, Brownsville assumed a modicum of international renown as the location for the film Stand by Me, directed by Rob Reiner. The film was shot in and around the community in June and July 1985, with theatrical release in August 1986. About 100 local residents were used as extras in the film, and the event was memorialized in 2007 with the first community celebration of Stand by Me Day on July 23 of that year. The date for Stand by Me Day was chosen by local resident and expert on the film Linda McCormick, who recalled in a 2016 interview that the day had been picked as one that did not interfere with other regional events and "wasn't too close to the start of the school year." About 2,000 visitors made the pilgrimage to Brownsville for the 2007 event. The celebration has been held annually since that year, with the exception of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2016 iteration, honoring the 30th anniversary of the cinematic release, introduced the first "Ray Brower Memorial 5K Walk/Run," named in honor of the dead body around which the film's plot revolved.
