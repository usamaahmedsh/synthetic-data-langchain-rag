The National Soccer Hall of Fame is a public-private partnership among FC Dallas, the City of Frisco, Frisco Independent School District, and the U.S. Soccer Federation, and currently located in Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. It honors soccer achievements in the United States. Induction is the highest honor in American soccer.


== History ==
The Hall of Fame was founded in 1950 by the Philadelphia "Old-timers" Association, a group of former professional and amateur soccer players that wanted to recognize the achievements of soccer in America.


=== Museum ===

The Hall of Fame museum opened on June 12, 1999, in Oneonta, New York. The museum featured the hall of fame, a library, and an interactive soccer play area.
The United States National Soccer Team Players Association partnered with the Hall of Fame to create the Time In program, which honored people with a connection to soccer battling leukemia. Since the disease disproportionately targets children, a majority of the honorees were youth soccer players.
Prior to the 2005 induction of the "Magnificent Five", individuals from the early and mid 20th century had been largely ignored. This change was brought about by the acquisition of a large volume of historical records relating to this period. These records combined with previously developed eligibility criteria led to the induction of Tommy Fleming, Alex McNab, Johnny Nelson, Werner Nilsen and Fabri Salcedo, five players whose notable careers all took place prior to 1950. The "Magnificent Five" were inducted posthumously into the Hall of Fame in August 2005.
Sports Illustrated reported on September 4, 2009 that the Hall would be closing to the public outside of certain match days. As a result of financial difficulties, the Hall cut six of its nine employees during that same month. The director of the Hall of Fame for almost ten years, Jack Huckel, left his position on December 18, 2009. On February 10, 2010, it was announced that the Hall would close its facility, though inductions will continue.
In September 2015, it was announced that a new Hall of Fame museum would be built at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, the home of Major League Soccer club FC Dallas. The new museum opened during the 2018 Enshrinement Ceremony on October 20, 2018. This new facility features additional memorabilia from soccer legends and high-tech, interactive exhibits.


=== Archive ===
After the museum was closed, a collection of more than 80,000 items was distributed to various locations across the country, including the headquarters of Eurosport, a long-term corporate sponsor, in Hillsborough, North Carolina. The collection includes the following notable items:

== Eligibility ==
Eligible individuals may be inducted into one of three categories: Player, Builder and Veteran (player). New individuals are inducted annually.


=== Players ===
To be eligible in the Player category, an individual must have met number 1, and either number 2 or number 3, of the following three criteria:

Retired as a player for at least three years, but for no more than 10 years.
Played at least 20 full international games for the United States. This requirement is reduced to 10 games if the games were prior to 1990.
Played at least five seasons in an American first-division professional league (currently MLS or NWSL), and won either the league championship, or the U.S. Open Cup, or was selected as a league all-star at least once.


=== Veterans ===
Players who have met either no. 2 or no. 3 but who retired more than 10 years ago are automatically placed on the Veteran eligibility list.


=== Builders ===
To be eligible in this category, an individual must have had a major, sustained and positive impact on soccer in the United States at a national or first division professional level in non-playing capacity. Due to the broad, general nature of the criteria, nominations for this category may be considered. Nominations are screened by the Hall of Fame Historian and Researcher who submit their recommendations to the Hall as to the appropriateness of the nominee's inclusion on the eligibility list.


== Medal of Honor ==
The National Soccer Hall of Fame's Medal of Honor is the highest honor given to people who have grown the sport of soccer in the United States. The Medal is awarded to individuals who has "demonstrated vision and played an historic role in changing the course of soccer in America." The Medal has been given out only four times in history.
