Inside (The Songs) (shortened and stylized to INSIDE on streaming platforms) is a soundtrack album by American musical comedian Bo Burnham. Accompanying the film of the same name, each song was written, produced and edited by Burnham alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. Themes include mental health, the pandemic, and the internet.
Inside (The Songs) reached the top ten in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom. It was the best-selling American comedy album of the year and was certified Gold in the United States. Additionally, a number of individual songs from the special charted. "All Eyes on Me" became the first comedy song to enter the Billboard Global 200 charts.
A deluxe edition featuring outtakes and instrumentals was released on June 3, 2022. It followed The Inside Outtakes, an hour-long compilation of unused material from Inside, including new songs and alternate versions of existing songs.


== Production and release ==
Inside (The Songs) accompanies Bo Burnham's film of the same name. Filmed in his guest house in Los Angeles during the COVID-19 pandemic, Burnham produced Inside by himself—he is credited with the writing, directing, filming and editing. The outtakes for the special say that footage was captured between March 2020 and May 2021. The 90-minute special includes songs, sketches, monologues and clips of Burnham's filming process. Deteriorating mental health, the pandemic, the internet and the absence of an audience are themes throughout Inside.
According to Republic executive Tyler Arnold, he reached out to Burnham a few days after Inside's release, while watching the special, and the album was released a day after the contract was signed. He had been a fan of Burnham's for years and said in August 2021 that he had watched Inside around 10 times. Inside (The Songs) was released on June 10, 2021, through Attic Bedroom, Corp., Imperial Records, Ingrooves, and Republic Records. It is Burnham's first special to receive an album release since what., as Make Happy was never released as an album.
"FaceTime with My Mom (Tonight)" was released as a music video on Netflix's YouTube channel Netflix Is A Joke, on June 1. Four music videos were posted on Bo Burnham's YouTube channel: "Welcome to the Internet" on June 4, "White Woman's Instagram" on June 10, "All Eyes on Me" on June 16, and "That Funny Feeling" on November 27. The song "How the World Works" and the "Unpaid Intern" song and subsequent sketch were uploaded to Netflix Is A Joke on July 23 and July 25, respectively.
An alternate version of "All Eyes on Me", omitting Burnham's speech, was released as a single on July 2 as "All Eyes on Me (Song Only)"; it is also included as an additional track on an alternate version of the full album. Arnold said that this was done due to fans online requesting a song-only version. On July 20, 2021, the day of billionaire Jeff Bezos' flight to space, and July 21, the songs "Bezos I" and "Bezos II" were played a combined total of 1.7 million times, a rise of 21%. The song garnered widespread usage on the video-based social media TikTok.
In September 2021, a physical CD and vinyl copy of the album was announced for a release in December 2021, through Imperial Records and Republic Records. A limited number of CDs were signed. The Recording Industry Association of America gave Platinum certifications to "Bezos I", "All Eyes on Me" and "Welcome to the Internet" and Gold certifications to "Goodbye" and "Look Who's Inside Again".
