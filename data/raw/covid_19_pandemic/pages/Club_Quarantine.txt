Club Quarantine (Club Q) is a virtual gay club based in Toronto that began hosting URL (online) parties in early 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Created by four friends, recording artist Ceréna Sierra, DJ Casey MQ, comedian Brad Allen, and digital creative Mingus New, Club Q began by hosting parties on Zoom in March 2020. In Ontario, full closures of all non-essential businesses were recommended by the province on March 16 2020. Club Q's first online event took place on that same Monday, March 16, 2020, with a modest 12 attendees. The Club Q Zoom event on March 17, 2020 featured a spontaneous live stick-and-poke session where a virtual club-goer got a tattoo reading "Club Q". Later online events often saw 1,000 attendees. By April 2020, Club Q had partnered with PAPER magazine (a collaboration called PAPER x Club Quarantine) to host a series of events. Club Q hosted their first IRL (real life) - as opposed to URL) event for Halloween 2021 at a membership based co-working space called Eastroom in Toronto where 700 people attended. The IRL halloween event was called "Literally Dead" and was also live streamed to a Zoom audience.
