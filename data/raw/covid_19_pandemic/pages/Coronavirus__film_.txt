== Reception ==
Thadhagath Pathi of The Times of India rated the film two-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote, "The fact that the film was shot during the lockdown is appreciable but the message it aims to give seems outdated now. This is a film that might have worked brilliantly when news of the virus broke out in India". A critic from Telugucinema.com gave it one out of five stars and wrote, "‘Coronavirus’, the latest film on the pandemic, is another lousy film from RGV’s company."
