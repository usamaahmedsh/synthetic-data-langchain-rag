The band intended for 2020 to be a hiatus year, but decided to write an album during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. In an interview, Ryan Guldemond said "It's an album that we could only make once, during a very unique time in the world, and a focused response to that moment ... it’s an important album in our discography. I'm really happy we had the opportunity to chronicle this time in the world with a body of work." Ideas for the album were shared over phone calls and e-mail and members would record in the studio alone due to Canada's COVID-19 restrictions.
Guldemond states that the album was inspired by the isolation he experienced during the pandemic, wanting to theme the lyrics around "going within to understand oneself better, to be better." The album's title refers to both Canada's stay-at-home orders and "going inside of oneself." Guldemond imagined a fusion of industrial and dystopian sounds combined with alternative and indie rock. While beginning to write the album, Guldemond took voice notes during his walks, including the audio of Vancouver's 7:00 p.m. healthcare salute included in the first, second, and final songs of the album.
The band considers Inside a continuation of their 2018 album, Dance and Cry.
