The siege of Tigray was part of the Tigray war, the government-led siege on its people in northern Ethiopia's Tigray Region. 
After Tigray Defense Forces (TDF) retook most parts of Tigray including the city of Mekelle on 28 June 2021, after eight months since the outbreak of the Tigray war in November 2020, the Government of Ethiopia began to siege all parts of Tigray under control of TDF.
