The COVID-19 pandemic in Algeria was a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Algeria in February 2020. In response, the Algerian government ordered curfews, restricted gatherings, canceled public events, and issued stay-at-home orders between February and June. Some measures were re-implemented in later months in response to new waves of infections. A mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 began in January 2021. The pandemic disrupted anti-government protests, which largely halted in 2020 and resumed in 2021. 6,881 deaths were officially recorded by the Algerian government through 2022, although the World Health Organization estimated over 21,000 deaths had occurred through 2021.


== Background ==
On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. Unlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 was much lower, but the transmission was significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Algerians living in Wuhan were repatriated in early February. On February 12, the Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform announced it was preparing a new emergency plan for handling an outbreak of the virus.
