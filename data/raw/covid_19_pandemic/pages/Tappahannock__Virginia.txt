Tappahannock is the oldest town in Essex County, Virginia, United States. The population was 2,375 at the 2010 census, up from 2,068 at the 2000 census. Located on the Rappahannock River, Tappahannock is the county seat of Essex County. Its name comes from an Algonquian language word lappihanne (also noted as toppehannock), meaning "Town on the rise and fall of water" or "where the tide ebbs and flows." The Rappahannock is a tidal estuary from above this point and downriver to its mouth on Chesapeake Bay.
In 1608 English explorer John Smith landed in Tappahannock and fought with the local Rappahannock people. After defeating them, he later made peace.


== History ==
In the mid 1660s, Captain Richard Hobbs had rights to 800 acres south of Gilson's Creek at the Rappahannock River. In 1680, Virginia law required warehouses to be established in port towns, and that year surveyor George Morris created a survey showing Hobbs His Hole Harbour. "Hole" refers to where a ship could drop anchor in a deep part of the water, and thus it was Capt. Hobbs who parked his ship Elizabeth and Mary here in the vicinity of present-day Tappahannock. This area became known as Hobbs Hole.
The settlement was platted for 50 acres (20 ha), divided into half-acre squares. The port was established at Hobbs Hole and called New Plymouth, later changed back to the Native American name Tappahannock. As part of the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730, public warehouses for inspection and exportation of tobacco, the colony's commodity crop, were established at Hobbs Hole. Ocean-going ships could reach this port.
During the War of 1812, the town was seized by British naval forces under the command of Captain Robert Barrie on December 2, 1814. The British left the town two days later, after burning down the courthouse and two jails.
The Tappahannock Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
During the Tornado outbreak of February 23–24, 2016, the town was hit by an EF3 tornado on February 24, causing massive damage and injuring more than two dozen people.
On July 15, 2022, a fire destroyed many businesses along Prince Street as well as multiple homes in downtown Tappahannock, burning nearly half the town block. The cause of the fire, which started at the back of the Martin-Sale Furniture Company, remains unknown as of 2023. No deaths were reported aside from a pet cat belonging to one of the displaced residents. Since that time, the restaurant, furniture store, and art studio have been rebuilt and reopened.
In 2023, 1710 Tavern opened in a building originally constructed in 1710 that is considered the oldest tavern in the state. The historic structure retains many original features, including centuries-old floors, windows, ceilings, and fireplaces. Historically, the building served as an "ordinary"—a combination of a tavern and inn—where travelers could pay for food and lodging with money or trade tobacco. The structure predates the current road network in the area and functioned as a key stop along the main port.
During its restoration, efforts were made to blend historic authenticity with modern updates. The project incorporated elements such as bar floors made from 150-year-old wood salvaged from a former hardware store in Warsaw, Virginia; seating constructed from 125-year-old church pews from Newport, Virginia; and a bar counter fashioned from 300-year-old walnut sourced from Oakalona in Occupacia, Virginia.
In August 2024, the first phase of Tappahannock Central Park was completed, establishing a 2-acre recreational area that includes three pickleball courts, a tennis court, a playground, and a splash pad. The second phase, scheduled to begin in 2025, will expand the park's amenities with the addition of restrooms and entertainment areas.

Lowery's, a longtime seafood restaurant, operated from 1938 to March 2020, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In its place, a restaurant originally known as 528 Steak and Seafood opened and was later rebranded as 528 Italian American.
June Parker Marina was a small working marina located on what was originally known as Hobbs His Hole Harbor on Brockenborough Gut. This was the original port of Tappahannock. The town was designed around this harbor to efficiently transport tobacco from Marsh Street. Wagons could make one single left turn onto Water Lane, which ends at Hobbs His Hole Harbor, now June Parker Marina. Thousands of pounds of English ballast stone lies on the bottom of the river there, discarded hundreds of years ago for the export cargo of Essex tobacco.
The town is home to St. Margaret's School, a private boarding school.
The historic Tappahannock Debtors' Prison is located here. It was constructed sometime before 1769. It is one of three such structures remaining in Virginia, along with those in Accomac and Worsham.
