Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and containment, the streets of Paris are deserted. While some have fled in the provinces, seven families remain in their building at 8 rue de l'Humanité in the 11th arrondissement. Among the inhabitants of the building are in particular the owner of the bistro who is doing everything to open her establishment, an ambitious scientist wanting to find the vaccine, a hypochondriac and his lawyer wife who is trying to reconcile her professional life and her family life, a sports coach who gives his lessons by videoconference but begins to gain weight, his 7-month pregnant partner who goes viral with an anti-COVID song. There is also a self-made man who is successful in business but finds out that he does not even have the grade level of his 8 year old son. This confinement also has positive effects: During these three months of confinement, all these inhabitants will experience joys and anxieties, discover each other, get closer, argue and reconcile.
