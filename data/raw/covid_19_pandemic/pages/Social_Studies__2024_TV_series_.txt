Aramide Tinubu of Variety wrote: "Engrossing and troubling, the docuseries presents a time capsule of today while allowing the teens to speak for themselves."

On balance, though, what we witness is often more troubling and alarming than hopeful." Joel Keller of Decider suggested viewing the series writing: "The sheer volume of what Greenfield shows teens being up to will scare any parent more than any blood-and-guts show Ryan Murphy can come up with."
