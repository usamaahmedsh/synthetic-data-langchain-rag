== Response ==
Abkhazia is a disputed territory in the South Caucasus, recognised by Russia and a few other countries as an independent state, but regarded by most international actors as part of Georgia, which considers the area—together with fellow breakaway entity South Ossetia—as Russian-occupied territory. Early in the pandemic, senior Georgian government officials called on the WHO and other international organisations to provide support to people living in the two breakaways. They said Georgia would not block movement to and from the regions. Unlike South Ossetia, Abkhazia cooperated to a degree with Georgia, allowing dozens of people to make use of medical services in the Tbilisi-controlled territory, and with international organisations, with the UN Development Programme providing much-needed basic medical supplies and sanitisers. Russia supplied some 500 COVID-19 test kits and sent soldiers to support disinfection of public places. A curfew was in place for nearly a month but was eased late in April 2020.
According to the International Crisis Group, the situation in Abkhazia presents several vulnerabilities. Abkhazia suffers from weak infrastructure and underequipped medical facilities, lacks medical professionals and has an ageing population, with nearly 20% of residents over 60 years of age. Nearly 80% of medical personnel are themselves at high risk, being in their 60s or older.
