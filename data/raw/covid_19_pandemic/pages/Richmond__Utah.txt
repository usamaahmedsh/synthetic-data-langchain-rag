== History ==
Agrippa Cooper was the first settler in Richmond in the mid-1850s. In 1859, surveyors visited the Richmond area and determined it to be a suitable area for living, with abundant water that could be used for farming and milling, and land that was fertile for growing crops. Within a few years log cabins, dugouts, and a log fort had been built. In 1860, a sawmill and a schoolhouse were erected. The city was settled mainly by Mormon pioneers, such as Thomas Levi Whittle, John Bair, Stillman Pond, Goudy E. Hogan, and Marriner W. Merrill.
The city was likely named in honor of LDS apostle Charles C. Rich, who had been the Apostle who traveled to the American Falls area of California in 1850 to call the first ten Latter-day Saint missionaries (including Whittle) to serve in Hawaii. Other factors involved in selecting the name may also have been the rich local soil or that Richmond, London was the hometown of some of its English settlers.
In 1860, LDS Church President Brigham Young visited the settlement of Richmond to council and direct the settlement. The Native Americans in the Cache Valley were becoming hostile to many of the Mormon pioneers, and many violent battles had already been fought. Young counseled the settlers to "Move your families and wagons close together, then, if you are disturbed, you are like a hive of bees, and everyone is ready and knows at once what to do." This led the settlers to build a fort named "Fort Richmond".
Richmond was incorporated in 1868.
In 1912, an election was held about adding a Carnegie library. The Richmond Carnegie Library was built on Main Street in 1914.
The 1962 Cache Valley earthquake, which occurred east of Richmond in the Bear River Range, destroyed many pioneer buildings in Richmond, including the original home of Marriner W. Merrill, and the two-story LDS brick Stake Tabernacle.

== Economy ==
Cache Valley's first two creameries—Cache Valley Dairy and Union Creamery—were located in Richmond, each produced up to 40,000 lb (18,000 kg) of milk per day in 1902. The creameries were absorbed by Utah Condensed Milk Company in 1904, and then reorganized as Sego Milk Products in 1920. For many years, the plant was the largest operation west of the Mississippi. The factory remained in operations under different names and owners until 1984, closing due primarily to environmental issues.
Before the 2008 Financial Crises, Richmond had a decent downtown business lifestyle, with a grocery store, Wells Fargo bank, café, liquor store, Maverik gas station, and a fast-food chain. During the crises, the grocery store and bank closed, with other small businesses following suet.
Between 2008-2022, Richmond struggled to gain any substantial businesses in the city, especial in its downtown. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Richmond City opened a corner of the city park for food trucks, but it was not used until 2023.
In 2016, supermarket chain Lee's Marketplace announced the construction of a grocery store in Richmond, but construction did not start until 2022 and completed the following year. After its construction, many businesses started opening, such as a Dollar Tree, a pharmacy, two Hispanic food businesses, and a soda shop. There is still no bank in Richmond.
Notable businesses located in Richmond include:

Cherry Peak Resort, a nearby ski resort.
Lower Food's, a meat processor.
Pepperidge Farm, which opened a plant in Richmond in 1974, and produced over one million cases of Goldfish in 2011. In 2023, Pepperidge Farm said they would be initiating a $160 million upgrade.
