=== Wrongly announced the Promising Actress ===
A mistake of the organizers caused the announcement of the "Promising Actor in a Feature Film" award to be confused. The award originally belonged to child actress Ngân Chi, but before that, according to the press release, the award belonged to actress Oanh Kiều.


=== The winning of The Happiness of a Mother ===
"The Happiness of a Mother" has never been considered a strong or brightest candidate among the 16 films competing for the award. The film was even boycotted by the audience before it was released because it was related to the controversy of the main cast. Therefore, the fact that the film won the top prize and won 6 other individual awards raises many doubts.
Director Huỳnh Đông was also surprised because he did not think his film would win so many awards, especially the Golden Kite Award for Feature Film. However, he denied "spending money to buy prizes" as rumors behind his back.
