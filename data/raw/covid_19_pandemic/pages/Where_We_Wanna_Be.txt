Talking about the song, Daði Freyr said, "This song is about having people in your life that you love when faced with difficult times. [...] I wrote 'Where We Wanna Be' from start to finish in my home studio in Berlin, when there was a 2-person maximum in Germany. Spending so much time without meeting any new people can be tough, so I was really lucky to be stuck with my two favourite people in the world: my wife Árný and our daughter."
