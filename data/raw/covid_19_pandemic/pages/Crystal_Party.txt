== Ideology ==
Upon registration, the party described itself to the Finnish register as follows: "The Crystal Party wants to do politics with pure hearts and open minds. The party's vision is a higher consciousness, which considers people as unique and conscious individuals and as part of a universal whole. The Kristalli party promotes the realization of human free will and the right to self-determination. Everyone must be absolutely respected, simply based on the dignity of each person. Everyone is equal. Love is our weapon, truth is our sword, goodness is our shield".  
The party rejects materialism and instead advocates that decisions should be "guided by the heart". The party claims to be neither left nor right-wing. 
The party opposes vaccine mandates and espouses COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Its former chairperson, Juho Lyytikäinen, has called Bill Gates "world's most influential doctor" and claims that the pandemic is orchestrated by the World Health Organization. The party also believes that "Western" medicine is not enough to answer all the questions regarding modern health problems. Instead, it supports "alternative medicine" like homeopathy and advocates for official recognition of such treatments.


== Local representation ==
In 2020, a city councillor in Polvijärvi was expelled from the Social Democratic Party after denying the Holocaust. She later founded a councillor group for the Crystal Party and thus became the party's first and so far only municipal councillor.
The Crystal Party took part in its first elections during the 2021 municipal elections. The party won 6,285 votes (0.3% of overall share) at the national level. None of its candidates were elected. One of the best-known candidates of the party was Maria Nordin, a controversial wellness coach.
