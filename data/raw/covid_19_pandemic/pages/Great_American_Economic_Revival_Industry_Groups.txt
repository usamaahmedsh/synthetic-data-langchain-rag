The Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups were created by U.S. President Donald Trump to combat the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump originally proposed a second task force, following the White House Coronavirus Task Force. He later referred to the group as the "opening our country taskforce" and "opening our country council". Larry Kudlow and Steve Mnuchin were expected to be named members. Further details were expected to be announced in mid April 2020.
