"We Are Warriors" is a song by Canadian singer Avril Lavigne released on April 24, 2020, for digital download by the BMG Rights Management. A re-recording of the final track—originally titled "Warrior"—from her sixth studio album Head Above Water (2019), Lavigne released the song as a charity single to support Project HOPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is her final release for BMG before signing to Travis Barker's label DTA Records and Elektra Records.


== Background ==
The original song, titled "Warrior", was released as the closing track of Head Above Water, and was described by Lavigne as "one of the first songs I wrote for the album after 'Head Above Water.' They are both about the health battle I continue to fight every day," adding, "I hope my songs can help you find strength if you need it..."
In April 2020, Lavigne announced an upcoming project in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to raise money for Project HOPE, an organisation "keeping doctors and medical staff safe all over the world". On 21 April, this was announced as the new single "We Are Warriors", to be released on 24 April. Along with amended vocals, "We Are Warriors" contains additional violin recorded by Lindsey Stirling.

The black and white video was released on May 1, 2020, and it showed clips of medical professionals on the front lines intercut with video submissions from fans who filmed themselves holding their signs and shoutouts. In addition, the video also contained footage from the Head Above Water Tour. Lavigne used an iPhone to self-film her own scenes from her home.
