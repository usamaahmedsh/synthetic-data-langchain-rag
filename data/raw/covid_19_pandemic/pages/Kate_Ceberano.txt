Ceberano first came to prominence as lead singer for I'm Talking in 1984 with her first top 10 single "Trust Me". I'm Talking are acknowledged as the band "who pioneered New York-style art pop in Australia during the Jurassic Period of Pub Rock".

The group's debut album, Bear Witness, included three top ten singles, two top twenty singles and achieved a platinum sales certification. Ceberano won the Most Popular Female Performer award at the 1986 Countdown Awards.
After the debut album, the group broke up and Ceberano went solo. It was then, in the late 1980s, that she earned a reputation for her soul, jazz and pop repertoire. Radio stations labelled her as having "one of the greatest voices our music industry has ever produced". Ceberano's first solo album was the live recording Kate Ceberano and her Septet, released in March 1987. In September 1987, Ceberano represented Australia at the 1987 ABU Popular Song Contest with the song "Time Can't Keep Us Apart", written by Allan Zavod, winning the contest.
In 1988, she collaborated with Wendy Matthews on the album You've Always Got The Blues, which was the soundtrack to the ABC Television show Stringer. The album peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA charts and earned her a nomination for the ARIA Award for Best Female Artist in 1988.
In 1989, Ceberano released her album Brave, which sold triple platinum. The album was the 20th highest-selling album in Australia in 1989 and spawned four singles, including "Bedroom Eyes", which became the fifth highest-selling single in Australia in 1989 and the highest-selling single by an Australian artist that year. Two tracks, "Young Boys Are My Weakness" and "Obsession", were recorded with Phil Harding and Ian Curnow at PWL Studios, with Harding recalling, "for us to work with such a great singer was an unusual treat."

The album was the highest-selling album in Australia in 1992, certified four times platinum. Three singles were released from the album, including "Everything's Alright" (with John Farnham and Jon Stevens), which peaked at No. 6 on the ARIA charts. Ceberano won a Logie Award for Most Popular Music Video in 1993 for "Everything's Alright". "I Don't Know How To Love Him" was the second single and won Ceberano another nomination for Best Female Artist in 1993.

The album included 16 hits from her career to date, along with two new singles: "True Romantic" (co-written with her Pash collaborator Mark Goldenberg) and "I Won't Let You Down" (a cover of the Ph.D single from 1980).
