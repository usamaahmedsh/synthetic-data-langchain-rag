The COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan was part of the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Afghanistan when its index case, in Herat, was confirmed on 24 February 2020.
As of 05 December 2025, there have been 235,214 confirmed positive cases and 7,998 deaths. As of 13 September 2021, there have been 118,180 recoveries. Kabul Province has had the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan, at 18,896, followed by Herat with 9,343 cases, and Balkh with 3,431. However, on 5 August 2020, an official survey from the Ministry of Public Health reported that approximately a third of the country's population, or roughly 10 million people had contracted COVID-19.


== Background ==


=== Origins ===
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Model-based simulations for Afghanistan indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t was below 1.0 and falling from November 2020 to February 2021.


=== Mass returnees from Iran and Pakistan ===

In March 2020, at least 150,000 Afghans returned from Iran, due to the outbreak across the country, at the Islam Qala border in Herat Province. As many as over 1.000 people a day crossed the border during the month. Between March and April 2020, the number of cases surged in Herat Province to over 200. At the Chaman and Torkham borders, over 60,000 Afghans returned from Pakistan in three days.

The Ministry of Public Health announced that this would be important in slowing the spread of COVID-19 and would also help decrease the surge in prices for surgical masks. On 14 April, a factory opened in Kabul, which is the first in Afghanistan that produces personal protective equipment (PPE). It produces 10,000 masks per day.


=== Facemasks Usage at Healthcare Settings ===
The general ministry of public health's policy indicates that during the COVID-19 outbreak wearing a mask has been mandatory in public spaces in Afghanistan since 2020. However, political turmoils, poverty, and the recent withdrawal of support from the United States and other international allies make it impossible for many Afghans to adhere to the country's health rules and regulations.
Remarkably, private and government hospitals tend to have distinctive approaches to facemask usage. Some private hospitals aiming to please their affluent visitors do not have strict rules about facemask usage and do not prevent those not wearing masks from entering the hospital premises. On the contrary, governmental hospitals generally provide free healthcare, mainly to poor people who cannot afford to use private hospitals. So, it is reasonable to suggest that the poor group of Afghans who visit government hospitals may not be able to afford to be compliant with preventive practices such as mask-wearing due to poverty.
A study found that while 71% of all participants adhered to wearing facemasks, 94% of these users wore surgical masks, and 86% wore all types of facemasks correctly. Gender plays a role in mask-wearing. While women have a higher adherence rate to wearing facemasks than men, gender socialization of women and girls to wear the niqab or hijab interacts with their adherence to wearing facemasks.
