The precise definitions of and punishments for aggravated sexual assault and aggravated rape vary by country and by legislature within a country.


== Effects on victims ==
 
Aggravated sexual assault can lead to short- or long-term effects. Many people who have been sexually assaulted have experienced a continuing effect,  of mental or physical nature, or both; such effects may include trauma to the body, emotional trauma, or again, both. Some mental effects include post-traumatic stress, sexual disorders, and depression. Effects to the body include bruising, bleeding from the vaginal area, soreness, and/or a dislocated bone.


=== Post-traumatic stress ===
When people are abused they tend to push aside the memories of the event. The victim may begin to relive the event and experience anxiety. After a person experiences aggravated sexual assault they experience a sense of fear and helplessness. It may also lead to the victim being impaired in a social environment.


=== Sexual disorder ===
Children who have been subject to aggravated sexual assault tend to develop a mental and sexual disorder. A person who has felt powerless as a child may be confused over the differences between affection, sex and abuse.


=== Depression ===
An individual who has been subjected to aggravated sexual assault as a child may experience depression, typically more often and to a greater degree than any other person. Depression is a sense of sadness, and can cause a person to isolate themselves from society, and lose interest in activities they once enjoyed. Symptoms of depression include feeling worthless, hopeless, a change in eating habits, irrational anger or anxiety. Depression can also lead to suicide or thoughts on suicide.


== Laws by country ==


=== Australia ===
Every jurisdiction in Australia has its own legislation for sexual offences, and sexual assault of children is separately defined. There is variation in the terminology and definitions used to describe sexual offences between states and territories; for example, different states and territories define rape, sexual assault, and sexual penetration or intercourse without consent in different ways. It is extremely difficult to obtain a conviction for sexual assault; approximately 85% of sexual assaults never come to the attention of the criminal justice system, and of those offences that are reported, only a small proportion proceed to trial, with an even smaller percentage of these cases resulting in a successful conviction.

== Court cases ==
R v Cuerrier was a Supreme Court of Canada in 1998, ruled that intentionally exposing a sexual partner to HIV, without letting them know is considered aggravated sexual assault. Currier was aware of being HIV positive and how the diseases can be transmitted, but did not want to reveal that he is HIV positive because he lived in a small community. He began to have a relationship with a woman in which they frequently engaged in sexual activities. Weeks within their relationship, the woman began to question about sexual transmitted diseases, Curreier told her that he took a test a few months ago and was tested HIV negative and did not mention his current HIV status. During the same time, Currier begin to have another sexual relationship with a woman and when she asked about Sexual Transmitted Diseases he did not mention that he was infected. She then discovered that Currier had HIV and ended the relationship. He then was charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault. That is then when the Supreme Court determined that if a person with HIV does not disclose that they are infected it is considered aggravated sexual assault. More recently, Canadian courts have ruled that failing to disclose one's HIV status prior to sexual intercourse will not immediately result in a criminal conviction where it can be shown that the risk of HIV transmission is effectively zero.  In Murphy, the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed an appeal, overturning a historic criminal conviction for aggravated sexual assault. Though Murphy engaged in unprotected vaginal sex with the complainant knowing she was HIV positive, without disclosing this information to her sexual partner,  her undetectable viral load at the time of the sexual contact meant that that there was no realistic possibility she could transmit HIV to the complainant at the time they had sexual intercourse. In such cases, the complainant's consent is not vitiated by non-disclosure of one's HIV-positive status.
(Trevis Smith court case) An ex CFL player name Trevis Smith was convicted of Aggravated Sexual Assault. In November 2003. Smith was tested HIV positive, Trevis Smith was accused of having unprotected sex with two women, their identities were not revealed.
