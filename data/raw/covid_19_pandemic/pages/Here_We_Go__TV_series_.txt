== Production ==


=== Pandemonium ===
The show's pilot, Pandemonium, was confirmed as part of the announcement of the BBC's 2020 Christmas slate of programming in November 2020, having been commissioned earlier that autumn.
The pilot was shot over six days, and involved finding crew that were experienced in dealing with COVID precautions, which producer Tom Jordan admitted was initially difficult due to the amount of productions that were restarting at the time of filming; he said that a crew "who had worked on Covid-safe sets before was very helpful indeed as the masks and social distancing was second nature to them". Cast and crew were subject to a 'coloured band system', with different colour bands assigned to different members to ascribe how stringent COVID testing and precautions they should be subjected to. Cast and crew "wore masks at all times" and had their temperatures checked each day by COVID supervisors.
The show being filmed from the perspective of the Jessops' teenage son, Sam, and his handheld camera, meant that the scene at the end of the pilot involving the crashing of the family's car off a cliff onto the beach below would only have one take available, and "required incredibly detailed planning for weeks before". Director Ella Jones said this way of filming was something the crew "wanted to embrace", but had to balance the "home-video look" with ensuring it worked well with "comedic timing", and the expectations of the "broad BBC1 audience" meaning the show needed to be "both distinctive but also accessible". This meant "second camera perspective[s]" were added into the narrative at some points that were not as restrictive to what the audience saw, with the aim overall for "choreographed chaos" to "create something that felt amateur and spontaneous, thus enabling our audience to believe the home video conceit but not be distracted by it".


=== Here We Go ===
The pilot's commission to series was announced in November 2021. Basden explained that the premise of the series was inspired by his grandfather filming their family holidays as a child, and the "videos were often very funny by accident", and that he "liked the idea of a family talking to the camera and being aware that they were being filmed as it puts them under even more pressure to project positivity while everything is going wrong around them". He said that he had "wanted to write a sitcom about a family going on holiday for some time, as I think there's something really funny and high stakes about people under pressure to have a good time together, and the stress and anger this tends to produce instead".
The show's production team won an award at the Broadcast Tech Innovation Awards in 2022, with the Excellence in Audio Post-Production (Scripted) being awarded to Joe Cochrane and Elliot Bowell of Splice, who did post-production for Here We Go.
The second series was due to air in late 2023 but was pushed to early 2024. The third series was made available on BBC iPlayer on the morning of 25 July 2025, prior to the broadcast of the series starting later that day. The series was filmed from late October 2024.


== Reception ==


=== Viewership ===
The first series averaged 1.4 million viewers on the night of broadcast, rising to 1.7 million with on-demand viewership.
The third series saw viewership on iPlayer increase by 70% compared to the second series, and viewership among 16-34 year-olds double.


=== Critical reception ===
Flora Carr reviewing on behalf of the Radio Times called the pilot episode "a lockdown comedy special with gallows humour" and gave it three stars out of five, while Ed Cumming for The Independent called it "a valiant effort at exploring our current predicament" and gave it four out of five stars.
Rachel Sigee, reviewing the first full series for the i gave series four out of five stars, stating that "there's great charm to its characters and their eccentricities" but having the sitcom supposedly filmed by the son "feels like a meta-complication it doesn’t need". Benji Wilson for The Daily Telegraph rated the series five stars out of five and as "an instant stone-cold comedy classic".
Broadcast's Miriam McHugh said the show was "a criminally underrated gem" that "didn't get the credit due when it was released, but is an entertaining entrant to the mockumentary canon".
