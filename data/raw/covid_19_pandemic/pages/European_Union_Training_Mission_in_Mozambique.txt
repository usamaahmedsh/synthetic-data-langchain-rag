EUTM-Moz (European Union Training Mission in Mozambique) is a European Union multinational military training mission headquartered in Maputo, Mozambique.
11 EU members (Portugal, Greece, Italy, Finland, Romania, Spain, Belgium, Lithuania, Austria, Luxembourg and Estonia) are engaged in this mission and have sent soldiers to the Republic of Mozambique.


== Mandates ==
The decision to create EUTM-Moz was first adopted by the European Council at a meeting in July 2021 and it was requested by the Mozambican Government. The goal of the mission is to provide training and support to the Mozambican Armed Forces in order to protect civilian populations and restore security in the Cabo Delgado Province. The mission will end two years after full operational capacity is achieved. It has a budget of €15.16 million. In May 2024, the mission, now known as the European Union Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM) in Mozambique, was extended until June 2026.


== Objectives ==
The mission will train 11 companies: 5 companies of Mozambican Navy marines in Katembe and 6 companies of Mozambican Army Special Forces in Chimoio with the goal of equipping the Mozambican Armed Forces with a capable Quick Reaction Force with around a total of 1,100 soldiers undergoing training during the entire mission. To do so, it will provide:

Military training including operational preparation
Specialised training, including on counterterrorism
Training and education on the protection of civilians and compliance with international humanitarian law  and human rights law, including specific training on Women, Peace and Security
The EUTM Mozambique Mission builds on the existing Portuguese Army Training Mission, first created in January 2021, with the goal of training Mozambican special forces, marines and quick reaction forces, in response to the Cabo Delgado Crisis.
