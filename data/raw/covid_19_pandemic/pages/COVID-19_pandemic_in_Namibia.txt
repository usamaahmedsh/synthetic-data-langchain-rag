The COVID-19 pandemic in Namibia is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Minister of Health and Social Services, Kalumbi Shangula, announced on 14 March 2020 that the virus had reached Namibia. A Romanian couple constituted the two first cases and recovered 79 days after their initial diagnosis.
On 17 March 2020, President Hage Geingob declared a state of emergency which introduced measures such as the closure of all borders, suspension of gatherings and economic related resolutions. The Ministry of Health and Social Services also established an Emergency Response team, operating 24/7, which aimed to intensify the surveillance of COVID-19 in the country, especially at the borders of Namibia. On 28 March 2020, the country went into a full lockdown.
No infections were reported from 6 April 2020 to 20 May 2020, however there was a notable increase in cases after this period - possibly due to local transmission. A second and higher rise of infections began in July 2020, following relaxed restrictions in several regions. The first death was reported 116 days after the arrival of COVID-19 in Namibia.
On 31 July, the Health Minister announced a relaxation in quarantine protocols that would account for faster recovery rates. Patients with a positive COVID-19 result will automatically be regarded as recovered 10 days after their infection, given that they do not display symptoms anymore. According to the Minister, "it has been proven that a person may test positive for COVID-19, for many more week after the symptoms have resolved. However, this does not mean such person is still infective or poses a risk to infect others (sic)".
As of September 2020, Namibia was within the top 18 number of countries with the most COVID-19 cases reported in Africa. Although Erongo lead with the most cases and deaths, Khomas region started to experience a community outbreak and numbers rose exponentially to match that of Erongo. In mid-September, most restrictions were lifted after a significant decrease in daily cases.


== Background ==
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.
The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

=== Confirmed cases ===


==== March 2020 ====

On 14 March, Namibia reported its first cases of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2. They were a Romanian couple who arrived in Windhoek from Spain via Doha, Qatar, on 11 March. They had been screened on arrival at Hosea Kutako International Airport but showed no symptoms at that time. The couple presented to a private health facility with flu-like symptoms in Klein Windhoek and was referred for testing. At that time, Namibia did not have the capacity to test for COVID-19, so tests had to be sent to South Africa. Their results came back on 14 March and were announced for the first time by the Minister of Health and Social Services.
On 19 March, a third case was confirmed. A 61-year-old German citizen, who arrived in Namibia on 13 March, was tested positive. On 23 March, the fourth case was confirmed.

== Statistics ==


=== Cumulative confirmed cases ===


=== Confirmed new cases per day ===


=== Cumulative confirmed deaths ===


=== Confirmed deaths per day ===


=== Figures per region ===
All 14 regions are known to have COVID-19 positive patients.


=== Testing data ===

Testing for COVID-19 is done by two entities (one public and one private) throughout Namibia. State testing is done by Namibian Institute of Pathology (NIP) while private testing is done by PathCare.
Erongo region, which is the region with the most cases nationwide, leads with the number of tests performed.
Khomas and !Karas regions also have high number of tests carried out. Windhoek, the capital, is situated in Khomas region and is where the initial infections were reported. !Karas region houses many quarantine facilities for Namibians returning from abroad. Many people enter here from South Africa (which it borders at the south) and have thus a higher number of tests carried out compared to other regions.
As of 29 September 2020, a total of 97,008 tests were carried out.


== Government preparation and responses ==


=== Initial reactions ===


==== Suspension of flights and state of emergency ====

Later, on 18 March 2020, all ports of entry were closed from highly affected countries (i.e. most Schenghen countries). All public and private schools were closed for a month, and large gatherings were prohibited. This included celebrations for the 30th anniversary of Namibian independence that was to take place on 21 March. Libraries, museums, and art galleries were also closed.
On 17 March President Hage Geingob declared a state of emergency as a legal basis to restrict fundamental rights, e.g. to freely move and assemble, guaranteed by the Constitution. The prohibition of large gatherings was clarified to apply to 50 or more people.


==== Access to information, surveillance ====
A COVID-19 communication hotline (0800100100) was established on 15 March 2020 which is run by the Ministry of Health and Social Services and the Centre for Disease Control of Namibia (CDC). The hotline serves to answer general enquiries of the public, assisting persons seeking guidance from the Ministry and reporting possible symptoms or cases of COVID-19.
The Government also announced on 18 March that it will strengthen their communication to the public via various platforms, such as the COVID-19 communication centre operated by NBC, in an attempt to "mitigate and refute misinformation, fear and panic especially from social media". The centre was fully functional by middle April 2020.
With the establishment of a multi-disciplinary Emergency Response team, the Ministry intensified their surveillance in monitoring the situation of COVID-19 in the country, especially at the borders of Namibia. The response team operates 24/7.
Screening at all points of entry has become mandatory. All Namibians returning from high risk areas were to go under mandatory quarantine for 14 days; all costs are covered by the Government.


==== Schools, tertiary education ====
As per the regulations of stage 1 and the proclamation of the State of Emergency, all schools, early development childhood centres and tertiary institutions should be closed, and attendance is prohibited. Schools are to reopen in a phased manner - necessitating the grades with higher priorities and workload (see below).


==== Military field hospital ====
A class two military field hospital was established at the Hosea Kutako International Airport to deal with persons identified with possible symptoms and as a quarantine facility.
The Central State Hospital, amongst others, also underwent renovations to its emergency rooms and ICU wards to allow it to operate in a COVID-19 environment.


==== Testing ====
Before the confirmation of COVID-19 in Namibia, tests could not be done locally. Instead, samples had to be sent to South Africa for testing, which accounted for longer than usual waiting times. Namibian Institute of Pathology (NIP) started testing locally in Windhoek at the end of March 2020. In late April, private laboratory PathCare started testing samples. Namibia was hit by a lack of reagents at the end of April, which slowed down testing. Private testing at PathCare is expensive (about N$850) compared to state (NIP) testing which is free to the patient. At the end of April, 362 tests had been conducted, 206 by the Namibian government through the Namibian Institute of Pathology (NIP), and 156 by South African laboratories.
On 1 July, the Health Ministry announced that there is substantial backlog of laboratory results. Results announced at this time dated back to samples tested almost a week before that. The Ministry however said they were "working on this matter" together with the Namibian Institute of Pathology. As of 1 July, 9,551 tests were carried out.


==== Economic stimulus package ====
An Emergency Income Grant was set up by government to distribute N$ 750 to every person that lost income or faces otherwise difficult conditions due to the lockdown. Over 800,000 people applied for this grant. 346,000 of them were paid by the end of April.


=== Lockdown ===


==== Khomas & Erongo regions ====
Beginning 27 March, a 21-day lockdown of the regions of Erongo and Khomas was announced as per regulations of stage 1 (see below).
This was the initial lockdown of the two main economic hubs; the "heart" of the Namibian economy.


==== National ====
On 14 April the lockdown was extended to 4 May. It now officially applied to all regions, although the stay-at-home order had already been enforced countrywide. Some of the lockdown conditions were amended, such that now fishing counted as essential service, and open markets as well as informal trade were allowed to operate. Namibia moved into stage 2 on 5 May 2020. Namibia moved to stage 4 on 29 June 2020. Namibia reverted to stage 3 for 16 days on 13 August.


==== Erongo region ====
The city of Walvis Bay was moved back to stage 1 on 28 May because two infected people came into contact with local people. The rest of the country entered stage 3 on 2 June 2020. On 8 June the lockdown of Walvis Bay was extended to all of Erongo Region for 14 days after a worrying spike in cases in the region - constituting a full lockdown. This lasted until 23 June, when the whole region migrated to stage 3. The constituencies of Walvis Bay, Swakopmund and Arandis are excluded, although travel are allowed for emergency reasons only.


== Reopening of the economy ==


=== Lockdown stages ===
President Hage Geingob announced on 30 April the gradual reopening of the economy in various stages. Each stage will have an observance period of 28 days - twice the incubation period of COVID-19.
The addition of stage 5 was announced on 22 June 2020 by the President, Hage Geingob. This stage constitutes the "new normal" which will last until the end of the state of emergency.


=== Return to normal ===
Prior to the lapse of the lockdown a 4-stage strategy was developed to gradually ease restrictions:

The lockdown itself is stage 1.
In stage 2 most businesses are allowed to operate again, and people are allowed to move around. Employees over 60 and those chronically sick are to work from home. In public a face mask is to be worn, and social distancing is still to be implemented. Gatherings of more than 10 people, contact sports, bars and gyms are not allowed, alcohol may not be sold, and international borders remain closed.
Stage 3 is envisaged to follow 28 days after stage 2, twice the incubation period of the virus. It will allow the reopening of schools and universities and a gradual opening of borders. Public gatherings of up to 20 people will be permitted.
Stage 4, again 28 days after stage 3, is planned as the full return to pre-pandemic regulations with the exception of large gatherings. Borders remain closed and health protocols remain in place. Public gatherings increase to 250+ people.
Stage 5 is the final stage where most restrictions are lifted or reviewed. This stage is intended to last until there is a vaccine for the virus.
Namibia moved into stage 2 on 5 May 2020. The city of Walvis Bay was moved back to stage 1 on 28 May because two infected people came into contact with local people. The rest of the country entered stage 3 on 2 June 2020. On 8 June the lockdown of Walvis Bay was extended to all of Erongo Region for 14 days.


=== Education ===
The resumption of face-to-face teaching was phased to resume during August, but has subsequently changed due to changing conditions. The Namibian Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture have on multiple stages altered the resumption of face-to-face teaching mainly due to student and teacher unions' demands.
The academic year was extended to 18 December 2020 for all grades.


=== Curfew, revert to stage 3 ===
On 12 August 2020 when President Hage Geingob addressed the nation in his 15th COVID-19 media conference, it was announced that all 14 regions will revert to stage 3 after "the confirmation of clustered community transmission". The President announced that a curfew will be introduced in the local constituencies of Windhoek (and surround areas), Walvis Bay, Swakopmund and Arandis. The curfew will be in effect from 20:00 until 05:00 the next morning. Additional measures (amongst others) included:

Restaurants may only operate on a take-away basis (stage 2 restrictions).
Nightclubs, casinos and gambling houses not allowed to operate.
Increased mass testing in Windhoek where "clustered community transmission" has been confirmed.
On 28 August, this stage was extended until 11 September. The curfew now applied to everyone nationwide.


=== End of COVID-19 measures ===
In July 2022, government ended all national restrictions. In August 2022, six small border posts that had remained closed throughout the pandemic, were reopened. The only remaining restriction is that international travellers have to produce a document showing they are vaccinated, or a negative PCR test.


== Assistance ==


=== Aid ===


==== Diagnostic kits ====
On 18 March 2020, Kalumbi Shangula, on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Social Services, received a donation of 1 000 diagnostic test kits from the Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yiming. This was to increase the testing capacity of COVID-19 in the country.
On 28 March, Namibian bank Bank Windhoek donated 500 reagent- and swop testing kits.


==== Financial, electronics ====
On 21 March 2020, the Ministry of Health received a monetary donation from the Rössing Uranium Limited company to help fight the spread of COVID-19 in Namibia. Incident Manager, Mrs. M. Kavezembi received N$200 000.00 on behalf of the Ministry.
Old Mutual Namibia donated electronics worth N$998 030.46 to the Health Ministry "to facilitate the process of rapid case search, contact tracing and data management". The donation included 35 laptops and 37 tablets.


==== Humanitarian ====
The Indian community in Namibia, with support from the High Commission of India in Windhoek (India's diplomatic mission) contributed food packets and essential supplies for Namibian people severely affected by the COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020.


==== PPE, other medical supplies ====
In the first months of the pandemic, the Namibian Health Ministry received face masks and other personal protective equipment from various international sources.

The CDC country director, Eric Dziuban, provided such supplies for the staff operating at the Emergency Operations Centre.
Sanlam Namibia (via its CEO, Tertius Steers) donated face masks and a mobile van for testing and screening.
WHO, through its representative in Namibia, Charles Sagoe-Moses, donated face masks and testing kits.
The Republic of Turkey donated surgical masks, N95 masks, medical overalls, and other equipment. According to Namibia's Health Ministry, "it has been very difficult ... to secure a desirable stock level of these essential supplies". The Ministry said "the donation is appreciated indeed and will go a long way in addressing the shortfall".


=== Cooperation ===
On 2 June 2020, The President had a telephonic call with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. President Geingob "expressed appreciation to Canada for the support during the liberation struggle and the principled positions leading to the implementation of Resolution 435." The President also shared concerns with regard to COVID-19 figures in Namibia and the reopening of the economy. Prime Minister Trudeau also pledged support to President Geingob on the issue of classification of Namibia as an upper middle-income country, informing that with "climate change, other countries, specifically those from the Caribbean also faced a similar challenge of classification as upper middle-income countries".


== Impact on society ==


=== Misinformation ===

In early April 2020, reports on social media originated stating that 5G is a direct cause of COVID-19. Namibia's mobile telecommunications monopoly, MTC, denied these claims in a statement saying that Namibia does not have 5G installed yet.


=== Panic buying ===
Caused by ambiguous information from government, a short wave of panic buying ensued in the last week of March in the Erongo Region and selected shops in Windhoek. Several shops increased prices for hygiene products and fruits for private brewing. The events were being investigated by the Namibian Competition Commission.


=== Crime rates ===
Due to the lockdown, crime rates, road accidents and rape decreased significantly. Hospitals reported fewer admissions due to alcohol-related violence but went "back to normal" on the first day the alcohol sales ban was lifted again.


=== Education ===
Many students expressed their concerns regarding the late reopening of schools. A change.org petition, labelled "Motion for schools to open earlier for grade 11s and 12s in Namibia" has gained over 2,500 signatures in an attempt to convince the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture to open schools earlier.
After a concerning spike in cases in the country in late July, especially in the capital, classes for pre-primary grades and grades 1-9 were suspended. Only grade 10-12 were allowed to attend face-to-face classes.
