== History ==
The village is named after E. H. Harriman, former president of the Union Pacific railroad, whose estate — Arden — is adjacent to the village. Previously, the village was known as Turner, from the early restaurant of Peter Turner.


=== Charles Minot's achievement ===
In 1851, Erie Railroad executive Charles Minot was waiting in a train parked at Turner Station, until seeing the new telegraph wires next to the tracks. He ran into the station and wired to Monroe, to see if the eastbound train had passed them already, to which they responded no. Minot then ordered the train engineer to proceed to Goshen, but he refused. Instead of giving up, Minot got into the cab and drove the train himself to Goshen, then all the way to Port Jervis, hours ahead of schedule. Minot's way of communication was a first for the railroad industry at the time, which prompted a monument to be erected in 1912 along with a large ceremony, with many notable people attending such as the Erie president Frederick Underwood, Mrs. Harriman and more. In the 1980s, the bronze tablet on the monument was briefly removed by Conrail for "preservation purposes" but was placed back after community backlash. The tablet was then stolen again by an unknown party and has yet to be returned. It is unknown whether Conrail removed it again or if it was stolen.


=== Railroad service in Harriman ===

In 1838, Peter Turner had constructed a large train depot named the Orange Hotel. It was 3 stories tall, with a large dining hall and lavish rooms. It sat along the train tracks for the New York & Erie Railroad and was a fairly popular place for people to stop. But on December 26, 1873, the hotel caught fire in the attic. Due to a lack of fire suppression equipment in the area, it was unable to be extinguished, and the building completely collapsed within half an hour.
The station was replaced with a small depot until in 1909, when Mary Harriman (widow of E. H. Harriman) donated land farther south to build a new station, since the shack was on the verge of collapse. In 1910, with the death of E. H. Harriman, the Turner Village Improvement Association proposed renaming Turner to Harriman. The association voted 58 to 13 to change the name. The village was divided on this matter, with one church putting up a banner reading "LONG LIVE TURNER," with the village responding by tearing it down. After this controversy had subsided, work began on the new station depot. With $6,000 donated from Harriman's widow, the station was much better designed, with a style that closely matched Tuxedo's station to the south.

The new station served the Erie Railroad for decades, until its bankruptcy, where service was transitioned into the newly formed Erie Lackawanna Railway, then into Conrail only 16 years later, and finally the Metro-North Railroad. By the 1980s the station was boarded up and train service had been transitioned onto the present day route, with a new station being constructed south of Harriman on Route 17. The station remained decaying until 2006 where the Harriman building inspectors told Norfolk Southern Railway (the current owners of the land it stood on) to either refurbish the station or tear it down, which the railroad chose the latter. Presently, the former railroad from River Road, Harriman to East Main Street, Middletown has been converted into a 19.5 mile long shared-use path named the Heritage Trail.


=== Harriman Bicentennial Capsule ===
On July 4, 1976, a time capsule was placed in a small park between South Main Street and Grove Street. It was named the Harriman Bicentennial Capsule and will be opened on July 4, 2026.


=== New Village Hall ===
In 2019, the Village Hall was demolished with plans to build a larger one combining the Village Hall and Police station, but plans had been halted with the 2020 COVID Outbreak. In the meantime, village services were moved to the back portion of a closed school just a little down North Main Street. Construction finally started in June 2023, and the building was finished in September 2024, with an opening ceremony on October 19, 2024.

=== Harriman State Park ===
Harriman State Park, just east of the village, is the second biggest state park in New York. The park is located in Orange and Rockland counties, 30 miles north of New York City. The park is known for its 31 lakes, vistas, and public camping areas. Harriman State Park borders Bear Mountain State Park and the United States Military Academy's forest reserve, as well as partially borders Sterling Forest State Park to the southwest. 
E.H. and Mary Harriman owned 30,000 acres of land on part of their estate in Arden, New York. The state decided to build a prison at Bear Mountain. The Harrimans opposed this action and wanted to donate some of their land to the state to build a park. Once E.H. died, Mary proposed to the Governor that she would donate 10,000 acres and $1 million for the establishment of a new state park. The state must stop the plan to build the prison with $2.5 million to gain more land and construct park facilities. 
By 1913, Major William A. Welch began constructing the road from Bear Mountain to Sloatsburg, which is known today as Seven Lakes Drive. Several roads were being created around Bear Mountain to make it easier for the public to get to the new park. There was even a steamboat service from Manhattan that would transport people back and forth for the cost of 85 cents for adults and 45 cents for children.
There are more than 40 known hiking trails located in Harriman, as well as over 30 lakes and ponds.


=== Woodbury Common Premium Outlets ===
The Woodbury Common Premium Outlets is a major tourist attraction in New York. This is a shopping center located in Central Valley, New York, which is only 5 minutes from Harriman when traveling north on Route 17. The outlet opened in 1985, expanded 8 years later, and again in 1998. The center has 220 stores covering over 800,000 square feet of land and is one of the largest outlet centers in the world. Because of the immense size, different sections are arranged by color to make it easier for the public to find the store they are looking for. On the weekend, there is a trolley service that is available to transport shoppers around the center and from the parking lots. 
Woodbury Common is a major attraction for foreign tourists visiting the area. The most common tourists are Japanese because the outlet has cheaper prices than if the people were to get the same item in their country. Some stores claim that 40-50% of the profit they make comes from Japanese tourists. There are shuttle buses from New York City that make the trip to the commons. This outlet goes down in history as one of the most popular centers for tourism in the United States.

The New York State Thruway (I-87) runs along the eastern perimeter of Harriman. New York State Route 17 also serves the village. The business route, New York State Route 17M, runs through the main village core. US Route 6 runs along the northern perimeter of Harriman.
Harriman is served by Transit Orange, a bus service in Orange County, New York. They provide a Dial-A-Ride bus service along with The Main Line, which runs daily and follows the path of the Erie Railroad from Woodbury Commons to Middletown, making a stop in Harriman.
Harriman station on the Metro-North Railroad's commuter rail Port Jervis Line is to the southeast, off Route 17. An older stop on Grove Street in the village downtown served the Erie Railroad main line until 1983.
