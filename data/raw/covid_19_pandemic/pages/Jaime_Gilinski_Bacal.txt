In the 1990s, Gilinski acquired the Colombian assets of BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International) for a nominal sum after its global collapse. Renamed Banco Andino, it became one of the most efficient banks in the Colombian banking system within four years. The Gilinski Group sold the reconstituted bank for a reported $70 million.
The family then moved to purchase Banco de Colombia for $365 million, in what was then the largest privatization in Colombia's history. A group of premier private equity investors led by Morgan Stanley Asset Management investing $65 million, billionaire George Soros investing $50 million and Tiger Management with $35 million together with more than 100 other European and North American institutional investors co-invested with Gilinski.  Later, the family sold control of the bank to Banco Industrial Colombiano, and its controlling stakeholder Sindicato Antioqueño, in a deal valued at $800 million, among Colombia's largest deals. Gilinski received $418 million for its stake and retained a minority position in the new bank as part of the deal. As of 2018, Bancolombia was the largest in Colombia with a market capitalization of $11 billion on the NYSE.
In 2003, Gilinski acquired and subsequently merged Banco Sudameris and Banco Tequendama. This merger created GNB Sudameris, a bank with assets of over US$16 billion that ranks among the largest private Colombian banks as of 2018. The purchase of Servibanca, an ATM network with over 2,600 machines, and Suma Valores, a stock exchange commission agent company, has further expanded the network.

Shortly after, Gilinski launched a public tender offer to acquire up to 31.5% of Grupo Sura, one of the largest financial conglomerates in Latin America. After 9 tender offers and 18 months, Gilinski and GEA management reached and agreement that Gilinski and his partners would take at least 87% of Grupo Nutresa in exchange for his shares in Grupo Sura. In a tender offer finalized in April 2024, Gilinski and his partners reached 99.38% ownership in Nutresa. As of 2024, the market capitalization of Grupo Nutresa is US$14 billion.
