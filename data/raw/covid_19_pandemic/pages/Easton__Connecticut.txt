== History ==
New York was first settled in 1757 by men and women from Fairfield. In 1762 a congregation called the North Fairfield Society was established, and it gradually evolved into Easton. In 1787 Weston, then including lands now defined as Easton, was incorporated out of Fairfield. The area was slow to develop because of the rough hills along the Aspetuck River, and so it was not until 1845 that what is now Easton separated from Weston. Today, half of the town's property is owned by the Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, the major supplier of water in the area.
The deaf and blind activist Helen Keller lived the last several years of her life in Easton. Her house is still intact today and has been owned by several families since her death. The local middle school is named for her.
The 2009 Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree was a 76-foot (23 m) Norway Spruce donated from a private residence in Easton.

== Government ==
Historically, Easton has been a reliably Republican stronghold. In 1964, it was one of only eleven Connecticut towns to vote for Barry Goldwater. Easton also gave Goldwater his biggest margin in the state, being the only town to give him more than 60% of the vote. However, in 2016, town residents voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton with a plurality. In 2020, Joe Biden improved upon the Democratic margin in the town, though it fell slightly under Kamala Harris in 2024.

Easton's politics shifted significantly in the late 2010s. In 2019, the town elected orthopedic surgeon David Bindelglass as First Selectman, the first Democrat to hold the position in four decades with a rare Democratic-majority Board of Selectman as well. He was re-elected in 2021 and 2023. His margins of victory increased with each term, with his 2023 victory occurring alongside the "most decisive victory for Democrats ever in municipal elections," according to local media.
However, Republicans were able to regain power in 2025 after Bindelglass announced his retirement. Republican Dan Lent defeated Democratic Selectman Nick D'Addario to become First Selectman by 5 votes, allowing the Republican Party to hold the office of First Selectman and a majority of the Board of Selectman for the first time since 2019. It was the only town in Connecticut to flip control from Democratic to Republican amidst poor performances for the GOP across the state and the country.

Local leaders embraced the idea after being presented with it. The newspaper began publication on February 29, 2020, as an online source with involvement from the town government.
