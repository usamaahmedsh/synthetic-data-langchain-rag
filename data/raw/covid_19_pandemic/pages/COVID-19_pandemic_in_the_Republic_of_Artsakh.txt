The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread in April 2020 to the Republic of Artsakh (a de facto independent republic which existed on territory de jure part of Azerbaijan between 1991 and 2023). The first infected person was from the village of Mirik in the province of Kashatagh who contracted the virus from Armenia.
Through May 2021, Artsakh is reported to have performed 25,040 tests, of which 2,749 were positive.

On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.
The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 was much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission was significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.
