Cosmopolis is a city in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,638 at the 2020 census. It lies on the Chehalis River and U.S. Route 101, immediately southeast of Aberdeen. Cosmopolis historically had an economy that centered around its pulp mill, which closed in 2006.


== History ==
The area around the mouth of the Chehalis River is the ancestral home of indigenous Coast Salish peoples who are today referred to as the Lower Chehalis. The first white settler in the area, James Pilkington, staked a Donation Land Act claim to 155.5 acres (62.9 ha) on the south bank of the river in 1852. The site was later used for unsuccessful negotiations between indigenous representatives and the Washington territorial government for the 1855 Chehalis River Treaty. Pilkington built a cabin on the land, but later sold the property in 1853 to Kentucky-born emigrants David F. Byles and Austin E. Young. Byles and Young proposed a plat for a town named Cosmopolis on the south bank of the Chehalis River. The origin of the name is unclear; one account is that it came from an indigenous chief's name, and another claims that an earlier settler asked for a name that means "city of the whole world".
Cosmopolis was platted in 1861 and is considered the oldest modern settlement in Grays Harbor County (then known as Chehalis County). Several settlers had attempted to build the townsite as planned, but failed due to various business issues. A lumber mill opened in 1881 and soon became profitable, bringing other businesses to Cosmopolis, which was incorporated as a town in 1891. The Northern Pacific Railway constructed a spur line through the new town in 1892 that traveled across a bridge to Junction City on the north side of the Chehalis River, with onward connections to Tacoma. The mill grew in the early 20th century under various owners until it was sold to Weyerhaeuser in 1957.

== Economy ==
In 2006, Weyerhaeuser pulp mill operations shut down, costing the local community approximately 350 jobs and the city government about 40 percent of its tax revenue. A year earlier, Weyerhaeuser had closed their large-log saw mill in Aberdeen, losing 83 jobs. The Cosmopolis mill was purchased in late 2010 by the Gores Group and renamed Cosmo Specialty Fibers, which manufactured specialty pulps for export to Asia when it reopened in 2011. The mill closed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and briefly reopened in 2022 before closing again. Cosmo Specialty Fibers was fined several times for environmental violations by state and federal agencies, including a $2.3 million penalty issued in 2025 for chemical leaks by the Washington State Department of Ecology.


== Infrastructure ==
Cosmopolis lies along U.S. Route 101, a major highway that connects area of the Pacific Coast.
As part of the Chehalis Basin Strategy, a concrete, steel, and earthen dam was constructed on Mill Creek. Completed in 2018, the $3.1 million project replaced a 1913 dam that collapsed in 2008, forcing the closure of Mill Creek Park. While the old dam had hampered migrating fish, the new structure included fish ladders and local species of salmon and trout were recorded soon thereafter migrating past the dam.
As of 2023, the city services approximately 765 residents with water, sewer and stormwater utilities, generating approximately $1.33 million in annual revenue.
