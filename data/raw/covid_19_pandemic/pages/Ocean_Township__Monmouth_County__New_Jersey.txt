== Government ==


=== Local government ===

Ocean Township operates within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager form of government (Plan A), implemented based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission as of July 1, 1963. The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The Township Council is comprised of five members who are chosen at-large by the voters on a non-partisan basis to serve concurrent four-year terms of office in elections held as part of the May municipal election. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Council selects one of its members to serve as Mayor. The five-member Council sets policy and adopts local ordinances while the Council-appointed Township Manager oversees the day-to-day administration of the Township. The Mayor presides over the Council and, as a member, has a voice and a vote in its proceedings.
As of 2025, members of the Township Council are Mayor John P. Napolitani Sr., Robert V. Acerra Sr., David J. Fisher, Gitta D. Kaplan (elected to serve an unexpired term) and Jeffrey Weinstein (appointed to an unexpired term), all serving concurrent terms of office ending on June 30, 2027.
In February 2025, Board of Education trustee Jeffrey Weinstein was selected to fill the seat expiring in December 2025 that became vacant when Kelly Terry stepped down from office the previous month. Weinstein will serve on an interim basis until the November 2025 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.
Gitta Kaplan was appointed in January 2024 to fill the seat vacated by Margie Donlon after she resigned to take office in the New Jersey General Assembly. In November 2024, Kaplan was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.
Christopher P. Siciliano stepped down as mayor in October 2022 after receiving confirmation as the Monmouth County superintendent of elections. John Napolitani was chosen to fill the vacant mayoral seat and Kelly Terry was sworn in to fill the vacancy on the Township Council the following month.
In January 2017, John Napolitani was chosen to fill the seat vacated by Deputy Mayor William Garofalo when he resigned from office in December 2016; Napolitani will serve on an interim basis until the November 2017 general election, when voters will select a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.
In the May 2015 municipal election, the One Ocean slate won, with incumbents William Garofalo, Richard Long, Donna Schepiga and Christopher P. Siciliano winning re-election together with Robert Acerra, who won his first term of office.
At its January 1, 2015, meeting, the Township Council chose Christopher Siciliano to fill the position of mayor that was vacated when William Larkin resigned from office the previous November after 24 years on the council and the previous 12 years as mayor. The council appointed Richard Long to fill Larkin's vacant council seat.
In October 2002, former mayor Terrance D. Weldon, who was also the city manager of Asbury Park, pleaded guilty in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark to taking $64,000 in bribes from developers. His arrest was part of the first phase of a federal investigation known as Operation Bid Rig. On August 25, 2007, after almost five years, Weldon was sentenced to 58 months of prison and assessed a fine of $20,000 by Senior U.S. District Judge William H. Walls.
