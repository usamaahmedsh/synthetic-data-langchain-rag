The COVID-19 pandemic in Panama was a part of the worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Panama on 9 March 2020. One of the dead was a 64-year-old male, who also had diabetes and pneumonia. Of those infected, 83 were hospitalized. The infected individuals belonged to the 29-59 age group and had each recently travelled abroad. A 13-year-old girl died of COVID-19 on 23 March 2020.
The government declared a state of emergency on 13 March 2020. The move freed US$50 million for a period of 180 days to purchase goods and services to combat COVID-19.
A gender-based quarantine system was established, where only women were allowed to leave their homes on some days and only men were allowed out on other days. The quarantine system allowed police to easily tell whether someone was violating their quarantine. However, the plan led to harassment of transgender and non-binary people.
