"Nobody's Love" is a song by American band Maroon 5, released through 222 and Interscope Records on July 24, 2020, as the second single from the band's seventh studio album Jordi (2021). It is their first single without bassist Mickey Madden. The song was inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and the George Floyd protests.
Peaking at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100, it became their first single to fail to chart in the Top 40 since 2015's "Feelings" failed to chart altogether. However, the single became their seventh consecutive top-ten hit on Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart and record-extending 26th overall.
The remix, a collaboration with Jamaican singer-songwriter Popcaan, was released on October 16, 2020.


== Background ==
On July 20, 2020, Maroon 5 announced that "Nobody's Love" will be released at midnight on July 24, 2020. The band also unveiled the single's cover art, which shows a mysterious, vivid and colorful image of a woman looking at the ocean. This cover also has three different versions, all made in Technicolor and with a Smiley face logo.
The song was inspired by the George Floyd protests and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to Adam Levine, who said: "The entire process of perfecting this song was done with the whole world in mind. I'm hoping that "Nobody's Love" is a song that can give everyone a moment of peace and reflection during this unprecedented moment in our world's story. Whether you are an essential worker on the front lines, an outspoken citizen fighting for social justice, or just someone who needs a break to remember the potent power of love, this song is for everyone".


== Music video ==
The music video for "Nobody's Love" premiered on YouTube, at midnight 12AM (EST) and was directed by David Dobkin. It was shot on the Apple iPhone and filmed in isolation in Los Angeles, California. The video features an alone Adam Levine, sitting in a wooden chair in a backyard at night and smoking a marijuana  cigarette. In a joint letter with ACLU, Maroon 5 explained the events in the video:"It’s time to end the War on Marijuana. The aggressive enforcement of marijuana possession laws needlessly ensnares hundreds of thousands of people into the criminal justice system and wastes billions of taxpayers' dollars,". "What’s more, it is carried out with staggering racial bias. Despite being a priority for police departments, the War on Marijuana has failed to reduce marijuana use and availability and diverted resources that could be better invested in our communities."


=== Lyric video ===
A lyric video of the song was released on August 26, 2020. The visual employs the same color-changing aesthetic of the single's cover art, with calming scenes of waves crashing against the coastline.


== Live performances ==
On August 10, 2020, Maroon 5 performed "Nobody's Love" for the first time on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (as part of #Play at Home series), with the band members playing instruments separately in their own homes while in quarantine.
