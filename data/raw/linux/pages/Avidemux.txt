Avidemux is an application for non-linear video editing and transcoding multimedia files. The developers intend it as "a simple tool for simple video processing tasks" and to allow users "to do elementary things in a very straightforward way". It is written in C++ and uses Qt for its graphical user interface (GUI), and FFmpeg for its multimedia functions. Since version 2.4, it has two user interfaces: a GUI and a command-line interface. Since version 2.6, the original GTK port has been unmaintained and is now discontinued. It is free and open-source software released with a GNU General Public License 2.0 or later.
Avidemux is developed for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Unofficial builds exist for FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.


== Features ==
Avidemux is capable of non-linear video editing, applying visual effects (called Filters in Avidemux) to video, and transcoding video into various formats. Some of the filters were ported from MPlayer and Avisynth. Avidemux can so insert audio streams into a video file (an action known as multiplexing or muxing) or extract audio streams from video files (an action known as "demuxing").
An integral and important part of the design of the program is its project system, which uses the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine. Whole projects with all options, configurations, selections, and preferences can be saved into a project file. Like VirtualDub's VCF scripting abilities, Avidemux has advanced scripting available for it in GUI and command line interfaces. It supports a non-project system like VirtualDub, which allows simply creating all user configurations and saving a video directly without making a project file. A project queue system is available.
Avidemux has built-in subtitle processing, both for optical character recognition of DVD subtitles and for rendering hard subtitles. It supports various subtitle formats, including MicroDVD (.SUB), SubStation Alpha (.SSA), Advanced SubStation Alpha (.ASS) and SubRip (.SRT).


=== Components ===
Avidemux was written from scratch, but code from FFmpeg, MPlayer, Transcode, and Avisynth has been added on occasion. It is a standalone program that needs no other programs to read, decode, or encode. The built-in libavcodec library from the FFmpeg project is used to decode and encode various audio and video formats, such as MPEG-4 ASP.
The primary (though not the only) Avidemux programmer uses the nickname 'Mean' on the Avidemux forum.


=== Multithreading ===
Multithreading is implemented in the following areas of Avidemux (some partially via libavcodec):

Encoding
MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 (using libavcodec)
MPEG-4 Part 2 SP/ASP (using libavcodec or Xvid)
Earlier versions of Xvid are not compatible with this feature.
H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10 AVC (using x264)
H.265/HEVC (using x265)
Decoding
MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 (using libavcodec)
MPEG-4 Part 2 SP/ASP (using libavcodec)


=== Supported formats ===
Avidemux supports following file formats:
