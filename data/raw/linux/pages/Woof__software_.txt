Woof is a software application used to build a Puppy Linux distribution from another Linux distribution. This application must be run inside Puppy Linux, and an internet connection is required in order to download the other Linux distro's binary packages.
The CD-Remaster program available in Puppy Linux can be used to build variants of the Puppy Linux distribution.
In 2013, Woof was forked to Woof-CE, which uses a git version control system hosted on GitHub.
