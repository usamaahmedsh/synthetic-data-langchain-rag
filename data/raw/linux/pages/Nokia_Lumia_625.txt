The Nokia Lumia 625 is a Windows Phone with a 4.7-inch IPS LCD WVGA (480x800) screen and 4G support. It was presented on July 23, 2013.

It borrows features from the Nokia Lumia 1520, the Lumia 1020 and the Lumia 925.


== Release ==
It is set to cost €220 or £200 in Europe. $300–$350 CAD  It was released in China, Europe, Asia Pacific, India, Middle East, Africa and Latin America initially, starting September.


== Specifications/features ==
It features:

Support for up to 128 GB external memory via microSD card
Choice of colors - black, white plus translucent shades of orange, green, yellow
Signature Camera Apps - Smart Cam, Cinemagraph and Panorama
FM Radio
It has one of the lowest pixel densities seen in recent smartphones, as it uses the standard Windows Phone 8 resolution (800×480) but on a large display, so the screen will not appear super-sharp.
The 512 MB RAM according to some reviewers prevents one from playing high-end games and sometimes mar the multi-tasking experience for power users.
