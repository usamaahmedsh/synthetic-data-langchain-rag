== Bitbucket Server ==
 
Bitbucket Server (formerly known as Stash) is a combination Git server and web interface product written in Java and built with Apache Maven. It allows users to do basic Git operations (such as reviewing or merging code, similar to GitHub) while controlling read and write access to the code. It also provides integration with other Atlassian tools.
Bitbucket Server is a commercial software product that can be licensed for running on-premises. Atlassian provides Bitbucket Server for free to open source projects meeting certain criteria, and to organizations that are non-profit, non-government, non-academic, non-commercial, non-political, and secular. For academic and commercial customers, the full source code is available under a developer source license.


== History ==
Bitbucket was previously an independent startup company, founded by Jesper Nøhr in 2008. On 29 September 2010, Bitbucket was acquired by Atlassian. In September 2015, Atlassian renamed their Stash product to Bitbucket Server. In July 2016, Bitbucket added support for Git Large File Storage (LFS).
In March 2020, Bitbucket Server controversially dropped support for viewing three way diffs and in July 2020, Bitbucket Cloud removed support for its original repository format Mercurial.
