Detana!! TwinBee, released in Europe as Bells & Whistles, is a 1991 vertically scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Konami for arcades. It is the fifth entry in the TwinBee series and the second to be released for arcades following the original TwinBee (previous sequels were released directly to home consoles). Set several years after the events of TwinBee, players assume the role of Light and Pastel (marking their debut appearance) taking control of TwinBee and WinBee to defeat invading forces of the evil alien Iva and save planet Meru after receiving an SOS message sent by Princess Melora.
Detana!! TwinBee marked the debut of Japanese animator Shūjirō Hamakawa (credited under the pen name Shuzilow.Ha) as primary character designer for subsequent installments of the TwinBee series. The game proved popular among Japanese arcade players, earning several awards from Gamest magazine, while its ports to other platforms were also met with positive response from critics. A direct follow-up, Pop'n TwinBee, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993.


== Gameplay ==

Detana!! TwinBee is a vertically scrolling shooter game following the same conventions established in the original TwinBee, where players assume the role of Light and Pastel (whose names are given in the audio drama TwinBee Paradise) taking control of TwinBee (P1) and WinBee (P2) across seven levels to defeat invading forces of the evil alien Iva and save planet Meru after receiving an SOS message sent by Princess Melora.
The control configuration differs between regions; in the Japanese version, one button is used to fire the gun at airborne enemies while the other is used to drop bombs to the ground, while both buttons are used to do shoot and drop bombs at the same time in the European version. Holding down the shot button will cause a power-meter at the bottom of the screen to fill up, allowing the player to fire a "Big Shot" attack when releasing the button. Power-up items consist of bells which can be uncovered by shooting the floating clouds, as well as items uncovered by destroying land enemies. As with TwinBee, players can shoot the floating bells to change their colors. Besides the five different colors from the original TwinBee (yellow, white, blue, green, and red), two new bells are introduced: a purple bell that provides a "tail shield", activating barriers around the player's ship and a black bell that decreases speed of the ship.
Mini-bells and the lucky star from the first TwinBee return as well. GwinBee, a ship similar to TwinBee and WinBee also appears, allowing players to combine their ship with GwinBee to fire wider fire beams. Two players can also align their ships side by side to achieve the same effect or align their ships vertically for a powerful five-way spread. If both players align their ships with GwinBee between them, he will spring out and destroy all on-screen enemies. After the first loop is completed, players can replay it for a harder second loop. The game will be entirely over if the final stage is cleared again, but running out of lives results in a game over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue and receive a "free" power-up.


== Development ==
Detana!! TwinBee was created by most of the same team that worked on several projects at Konami such as the Gradius series, with director Masato Ohsawa leading its development and Toru Shimomura served as sole programmer of the game while Hiroshi Matsuura also served as engineer. Ryouhei Shogaki, Hiroyuki Ashida and K. Ishimoto acted as co-designers. The title marked the debut of Japanese animator Shūjirō Hamakawa (credited under the pseudonym Shuzilow.Ha) in his first project as game designer, serving as character illustrator for subsequent installments of the TwinBee series. Konami Kukeiha Club members Hidenori Maezawa, Masae Nakashima and Michiru Yamane scored the soundtrack. Yamane said that she wrote the music as colorful and fun to match the "cute bee world" of the project.
