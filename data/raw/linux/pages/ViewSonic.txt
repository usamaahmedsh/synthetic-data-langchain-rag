ViewSonic Corporation is an American privately held multinational electronics company with headquarters in Brea, California, United States.
The company was founded in 1987 as Keypoint Technology Corporation by James Chu and was renamed to its present name in 1993, after a brand name of monitors launched in 1990. Today, ViewSonic specializes in visual display hardware—including liquid-crystal displays, projectors, and interactive whiteboards—as well as digital whiteboarding software. The company trades in three key markets: education, enterprise, and entertainment.

The company was initially founded as Keypoint Technology Corporation in 1987 by James Chu. In 1990, it launched the ViewSonic line of color computer monitors, and shortly afterward the company renamed itself after its monitor brand.
The ViewSonic logo features Gouldian finches, colorful birds native to Australia.
In the mid-1990s, ViewSonic rose to become one of the top-rated makers of computer CRT monitors, alongside Sony, NEC, MAG InnoVision, and Panasonic. ViewSonic soon displaced the rest of these companies to emerge as the largest display manufacturer from America/Japan at the turn of the millennium.
In 2000, ViewSonic acquired the Nokia Display Products' branded business.

On July 2, 2007, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $143.8M in an IPO on NASDAQ.
On March 5, 2008, the company filed a withdraw request with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying "terms currently obtainable in the public marketplace are not sufficiently attractive to the Registrant to warrant proceeding with the initial public offering".
