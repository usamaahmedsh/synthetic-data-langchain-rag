The Nokia 3510 is a mobile phone for the GSM network, introduced by Nokia on 12 March 2002. It was the first Nokia phone to bring GPRS internet services to the mass market. It was also the first Nokia phone to ship with Beatnik's miniBAE engine, allowing for playback of polyphonic ringtones.
The 3510 is the successor to the Nokia 3310 and is built on the upgraded Nokia DCT4 hardware platform and a Series 30 user interface. The phone also supports MMS messaging, likely the only produced monochrome display device with MMS capability. A colour display variant, 3510i, was released later in 2002. The Nokia 3510i model supports Java 2 ME that makes it possible for users to download and use Java applications, background images and polyphonic ringtones.
