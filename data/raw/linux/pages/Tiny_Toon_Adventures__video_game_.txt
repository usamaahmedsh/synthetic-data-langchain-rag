== Gameplay ==

The player initially controls Buster Bunny in the effort to rescue Babs Bunny from her kidnapper, Montana Max (aka Monty). Before each world, the player can select an alternate character that they can switch into if they find a star ball. The three alternate characters are Dizzy Devil, Furrball, and Plucky Duck. Dizzy, Furrball, and Plucky have unique abilities that Buster lacks: Plucky can briefly fly and swim better than others, Dizzy can destroy walls and most enemies with his spin mode, and Furrball can climb many vertical surfaces, slowly sliding down them rather than plunging down. However, Buster can jump higher than others.
The first four worlds (The Hills, The Wetlands, The Trees, and Downtown) have three levels each while the remaining two worlds (Wackyland and Monty's Mansion) only have one level. Aiding Buster is Hamton, who will give Buster an extra lives for 30 carrots each. The second level in each world concludes with an enclosed area where the player must avoid Elmyra and exit through the door; if the player is grabbed by Elmyra, they must start the world over. The third level in each world concludes with a boss battle.
