The main aim of BackBox is providing an alternative, highly customizable, and well performing system. BackBox uses the light window manager Xfce.  It delivers a fast, effective, customizable, and complete experience. It also has a very helpful community behind it.
It includes some of the most used security and analysis Linux tools, aiming for a wide spread of goals, ranging from web application analysis to network analysis, from stress tests to sniffing, also including vulnerability assessment, computer forensic analysis and exploitation.
Part of the power of this distribution comes from its Launchpad repository core, constantly updated to the latest stable version of the most known and used ethical hacking tools.
