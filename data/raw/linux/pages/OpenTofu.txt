OpenTofu is a software project for infrastructure as code that is managed by the Linux Foundation.


== History ==
The last MPL-licensed version of Terraform was forked as OpenTofu in August 2023 after HashiCorp announced that all products produced by the company would be relicensed under the Business Source License (BUSL), with HashiCorp prohibiting commercial use of the community edition by those who offer "competitive services". In April 2024, HashiCorp sent a cease and desist notice to the OpenTofu project, stating that it had incorporated code from a BUSL-licensed version of Terraform without permission and "incorrectly re-labeled HashiCorp's code to make it appear as if it was made available by HashiCorp originally under a different license." OpenTofu denied the allegation, stating that the code cited had originated from an MPL-licensed version of Terraform.
