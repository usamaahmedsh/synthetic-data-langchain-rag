esbuild is a free and open-source module bundler and minifier for JavaScript and CSS written by Evan Wallace. Written in Go instead of JavaScript, esbuild claims to be "10 to 100 times" faster than other bundlers by using parallelism and shared memory usage. It supports TypeScript, JSX, tree-shaking and is extensible through plugins.


== Usage ==
esbuild is used in Vite, a front-end build-tool and development server, and the Phoenix Framework. It is included as a bundler for Angular since v17, Ruby on Rails since v7, and for Netlify Functions.
