Mermaid is an open-source JavaScript-based diagramming and charting software that generates diagrams from text-based descriptions. Created by Knut Sveidqvist in 2014, the project originated from a need to simplify diagram creation in documentation workflows after experiencing issues with proprietary software file formats.


== Features ==
Mermaid allows users to create various types of diagrams using a Markdown-like syntax, including:

Flowcharts
Sequence diagrams
Class diagrams
State diagrams
Gantt charts
Entity–relationship diagrams
The software provides both text-based and visual editing interfaces, allowing users to switch between the two modes. Users can create diagrams through the Mermaid Live Editor, a web-based tool that provides real-time preview capabilities without requiring local installation.


== Integration ==
Mermaid is supported natively by several platforms and services:

Azure DevOps (in project wikis)
GitHub (in Markdown files)
Gitea
GitLab
Joplin
Tuleap
Notion
Obsidian
Quarto 


== Development ==
As of 2024, the project is developed under both open-source and commercial models. The core functionality remains open-source under the MIT License, while a commercial offering called Mermaid Chart provides additional features and hosted services. The open-source project has garnered significant community engagement, with over 74,000 GitHub stars and 6,800 forks as of early 2025.
In March 2024, the commercial entity raised $7.5 million in seed funding from investors including Open Core Ventures, Sequoia, and Microsoft's M12 fund.


== Recognition ==
The project received the JS Open Source Award in 2019 for "The Most Exciting Use of Technology."
