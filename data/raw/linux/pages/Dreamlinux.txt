Dreamlinux was a Brazilian computer operating system based on Debian Linux. It can boot as a live CD, from USB flash drive, or can be installed on a hard drive. The distribution's GUI aims to have a centered animated toolbar.  As of October 2012, The Dreamlinux Project has been discontinued.


== Editions ==


=== Dreamlinux 2.2 MM GL Edition (2007) ===
DreamLinux Multimedia Edition 2.2 with AIGLX provides Beryl-AIGLX by default, which can be utilized after the initial installation. One of its key features is its ability to configure AIGLX for NVIDIA and ATI cards automatically. The distribution received a favorable review for its appearance and functionality.


=== Dreamlinux 3.0 (2008) ===
Dreamlinux Desktop Edition 3.0 features a complete redesign. It supports a totally independent architecture named Flexiboost, based on overlaid modules. The feature allows the co-existence of two (or more) separate window managers (currently Gnome and Xfce), sharing the same customized appearance. Both working environments share all the applications available.
In addition to the 700MB iso file (CD image), a 130MB Multimedia Module is also available, including DVD support.  This is primarily intended for use when running from USB flash drive, rather than from live-CD mode.
