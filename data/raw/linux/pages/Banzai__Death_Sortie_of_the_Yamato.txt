== Reception ==
H. E. Dille reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that "Since this particular designer has provided hours of enjoyment in the past, one can only hope his next effort does not require such a Sisyphus-like effort in terms of play balance."
The book The PC Games Bible describes the game system as "idiosyncratic" and that "it seems impossible to avoid anything other than the historical result", and concludes by saying that "GQS products are an acquired taste, and if this is to be your first nibble, another GQS title - for example the Midway titles might give more balanced game play. A title for the naval enthusiast."
