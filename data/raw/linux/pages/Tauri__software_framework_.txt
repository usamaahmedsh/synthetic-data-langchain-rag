Tauri is an open-source software framework designed to create cross-platform desktop and mobile applications on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android and iOS using a web frontend. The framework functions with a Rust back-end and a JavaScript front-end that runs on local WebView libraries using rendering libraries like Tao and Wry. Tauri aims to provide a more lightweight alternative to similar existing frameworks such as Electron.
Tauri is governed by the Tauri Foundation within the Dutch non-profit Commons Conservancy. As of 2024, Tauri is licensed and distributed under the MIT license, and Apache 2.0 license. 
Tauri 1.0 was released in June 2022. In early 2024, Tauri v2 Beta was released, which included mobile support for iOS and Android systems. On 2 October 2024, Tauri v2 was released as a stable release.


== Architecture ==
Central to Tauri's architecture are core components such as the Tauri crate, which serves as a hub for managing various functionalities like runtimes, macros, utilities, and APIs. The toolkit also includes essential tooling such as bundlers, CLI interfaces, and scaffolding kits, to streamline the development and deployment processes. Tauri supports cross-platform application window creation (TAO) and WebView rendering (WRY), which allows compatibility across macOS, Linux and Windows platforms.
Tauri is built using Rust, a programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and memory safety. It also allows users the function to switch individual APIs on and off, and provides an isolation pattern to prevent untrusted scripts from accessing the back-end from a WebView.
