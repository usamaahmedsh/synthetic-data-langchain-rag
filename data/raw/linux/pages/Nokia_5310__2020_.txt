The Nokia 5310 (2020) is a Nokia-branded feature phone developed by HMD Global, one of the Nokia Originals. It was announced on 19 March 2020 alongside the Nokia 1.3, Nokia 5.3 and Nokia 8.3 5G, as a revival of the original Nokia 5310 XpressMusic produced c. 2007.


== Functions and design ==
The 5310 functions primarily as a media-player with FM-radio, an MP3-player, support for Bluetooth 3.0 and front-facing stereo-speakers. A 3.5 mm audio jack is also present, and dedicated music buttons are located on the side. The phone has a 2.4" QVGA resolution display. On the rear, there is a VGA camera accompanied by an LED-flash. Internal storage is limited to 16 MB, but can be expanded up to 32 GB via a microSD card slot. The battery is rated at 1200 mAh and can provide 7.5 hours of talk time; standby ranges between 30 days for Single-SIM and 22 days for Dual-SIM. The device only supports dual-band 2G.
The design is styled after the original 5310 with the same color-schemes, Black/Red and White/Red.


== 2024 version ==
In April 2024, HMD Global announced the 2024 version of revival Nokia 5310, with design similar to the 2020 version, but with some improvements, like a larger screen at 2.8 inches IPS LCD (compared to the 2.4-inch TFT LCD of the 2020 version), bigger 1450 mAh battery (compared to the 1200 mAh battery), Unisoc 6531F chipset (compared to the MediaTek MT6260A chipset) and USB-C support (compared to the micro USB 1.1 support) and run Mocor RTOS with Series 30+ user interface (compared to MediaTek MAUI), meaning MRE (.vxp) apps are no longer supported. It is unlikely that the new 5310 will support any user-installed applications.
