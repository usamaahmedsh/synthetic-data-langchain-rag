Winux, previously known as Wubuntu and LinuxFX is a Linux distribution for personal computers based on the Kubuntu distribution and themed close to Windows 11. It bundles OnlyOffice and other software reminiscent of Windows. The Register claimed the distribution likely infringes on trademarks by Canonical and Microsoft, while ZDNet warns that it might be a scam.
As of August 2025 Winux's website is now at winuxos.org, after winuxos.com became inaccessible in July 2025.
