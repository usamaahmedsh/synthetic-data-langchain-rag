LinuxWorld Conference and Expo (renamed to OpenSource World in its final year) was a conference and trade show that focused on open source and Linux solutions in the information technology sector. It ran from 1998 to 2009, in venues around the world.
The show was owned and managed by IDG World Expo, a business unit of International Data Group (IDG). Keynote speakers included Linux creator Linus Torvalds, One Laptop Per Child founder Nicholas Negroponte, and Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig. Another IDG business unit, Network World, operated the LinuxWorld.com web site, which often carried audio, video, and presentation materials from the show, as well as interviews with the show's speakers.
This event should not be confused with the "Open Source World Conference", an annual Spanish-language event that ran from 2004 to 2012.
