Kallo.ng (Hausa language, viewing, watching, looking) is a Nigerian Hausa-language subscription streaming service based in Kano State. Launched on November 26, 2021, it is the first streaming platform to offer programming solely in Hausa. The platform is owned by Spacekraft Media Limited, which was founded in 2021 by Maijidda Shehu Modibbo. In an interview, Moddibo said the platform garnered 35,000 subscribers within eight months of its launch.
The Nigerian federal government says it is planning regulations for streaming and content providers such as Kallo and Netflix, worried that they can be used to “cause chaos” and undermine Nigeria's democratic processes.
