John Madden Football '92, released as Pro Football in Japan, is a 1991 American football video game developed by Park Place Productions and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Genesis. It was the second Madden title released for the console, following the original John Madden Football from the previous year, starting the tradition of annual installments.
New aspects of this version include instant replay, two-player cooperative play, quarterback injuries, highlights, and more audibles. There are also new play modes, such as pre-season games, regular season games, playoffs, and sudden death, which was a way to simulate overtime in NFL games. Quarter lengths have been adjusted in this version to be set at 5, 10, or 15 minutes. As in previous versions of the video game, there are no NFL or NFLPA licenses for authentic teams, player names, and stadiums. Teams are organized by city name and colors.
