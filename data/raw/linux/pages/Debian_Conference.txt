DebConf, the Debian developers conference is the yearly conference where developers of the Debian operating system meet to discuss further development of the system.
Besides the scheduled workshops and talks, Debian developers take the opportunity to hack on the Debian system in a more informal setting. This has been institutionalised by introducing the DebCamp in the Oslo DebConf in 2003: a room is set aside and computing infrastructure provided.
