== Information ==
The main characters of the game are Punk and Funk Croc. They are the suitors of the croquette, Daisy. The game is played in a screen by screen and level to level challenges in order to get Daisy. There is a cute introduction to the game with SoundBlaster tunes. If the game is not being played in two-player, a computer plays as the second player.


== Gameplay ==
In two-player mode, the gamers need to jump, bash, and catch upgrades faster than the competitor. In order to win the game, the player must light up all the light bulbs and bump them with the characters' head. If the bulb is hit three times it will completely light up, and when every bulb is lit up, the player can continue onto the next level. On the higher levels, some of the light bulbs are invisible. Gravity is not an issue in this game. Punk and Funk race to light their bulbs first in order to win. There are obstacles such as walls and blocks that block the route to get the light bulbs. The player can have three movements that include:

clockwise
counter clock-wise
jumping
mirrored movement
walking upside-down
