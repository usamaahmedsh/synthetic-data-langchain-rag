== History ==
GetTaxi was founded by Israeli entrepreneurs Shahar Waiser and Roi More. In the summer of 2009, Waiser came up with the idea during a thirty-minute wait for a taxi to the airport in Palo Alto, California. GetTaxi's beta version in Hebrew started operating in Tel Aviv two years later, in the summer of 2011, and the service was launched in London in August 2011.
In March 2012, GetTaxi branched out to Moscow, and opened its first United States offices in New York City.  In May 2016, the Volkswagen Group invested $300 million in Gett.
In 2017 Gett acquired Juno, a ride-hailing company primarily operating in New York City. Gett sold Juno in November 2019 in an agreement with Lyft, that saw Gett form a partnership with Lyft.
Gett's marketplace model saw further partnerships with Ola in 2020, and Curb Mobility in 2021.
In May 2024, Pango announced its acquisition of Gett and its operations in Israel and internationally for $175 million. The deal is subject to the approval of the Competition Commissioner.[1]
