The Nokia 6101, 6102, and 6102i are a line of mid-level GSM clamshell cell phones created by Nokia, announced on February 14, 2005. It was one of the last Nokia phones that still had an external antenna. The design of the 6101 was noticeably different than the company's previous flip phones that were more experimental, but with the 6101, Nokia chose a safer and established clamshell look.

The differences between the 6101 and 6102 are very small and the only visible differences are the style of the keypads and front bezel plate. These were also the first Nokia flip phones to get mass market distribution in the US. It was released there in September 2005 on T-Mobile as 6101 followed by Cingular as 6102. Nokia 6102 is also the name of the version made specifically for China Mobile. 
The 6102i is an updated version of the 6102 featuring Bluetooth capabilities and increased memory space. This was introduced in January 2006. Another updated version of the 6101/6102 is the Nokia 6103.
Its direct successor is the Nokia 6131/6125, which includes microSD card slot and native USB connectivity.
