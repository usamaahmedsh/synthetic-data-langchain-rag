JBoss Operations Network (or JBoss ON or JON) is free software/open-source Java EE-based network management software. JBoss Operations Network is part of the JBoss Enterprise Middleware portfolio of software. JBoss ON is an administration and management platform for the development, testing, deployment, and monitoring of the application lifecycle. Because it is Java-based, the JBoss application server operates cross-platform: usable on any operating system that supports Java. JBoss ON was developed by JBoss, now a division of Red Hat.
