Planet CCRMA (pronounced karma) Planet CCRMA (Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics) software is a collection of open-source tools and applications designed for music composition, sound synthesis, and audio processing. It is primarily built on the Linux operating system and integrates various software packages, making it suitable for music researchers, composers, and educators. It is a collection of Red Hat packages (RPMs ) to help set up and optimize a Red Hat-based workstation for audio work.


== Overview ==
The entire environment, called Planet CCRMA, was developed and tested at Stanford University and made available to the public free-of-charge from a central repository — Planet CCRMA at Home [1] The Planet CCRMA repositories are maintained at CCRMA by Fernando Lopez-Lezcano.
Installing the packages, transforms a Linux workstation or server into a low-latency system for sound and video production and distribution. The ALSA sound card drivers and other applications are provided without installation hassles, and the low-latency is achieved by having applied the real-time preemption patch to the Linux kernel.
