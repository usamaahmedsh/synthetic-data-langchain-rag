The Nokia 1110 and Nokia 1110i/1112 are low-end GSM mobile phones which were made by Nokia.  The 1110 was released in 2005; the 1110i/1112 was released in 2006.  Both were aimed at first-time mobile phone users.  In Nokia's view, the 1110i had the advantage of ease-of-use, reliability and a low price. These phones are very similar to the Nokia 1100.
Between January and May 2007, the 1110 was marketed by Nokia as their standard low-end monochrome model before being superseded by the Nokia 1200. One of its key markets was that of developing countries.
The Nokia 1110 is the second-highest-sold mobile device of all time, selling about 250 million units.
