nl is a Unix utility for numbering lines, either from a file or from standard input, reproducing output on standard output.


== History ==
nl is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification. It first appeared in System V release 2.
The version of nl bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Scott Bartram and David MacKenzie.
The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.


== Syntax ==
The command has a number of switches:

a - number all lines
t - number lines with printable text only
n - no line numbering
string - number only those lines containing the regular expression defined in the string supplied.
The default applied switch is t.
nl also supports some command line options.


== Example ==

The following example numbers only the lines that begin with a capital letter A (matching on the regular expression /^A/).  filename is optional.

It can be useful as an alternative to grep -n:
