== Reception ==
Frank Lewis of CNET gave the Nokia 2310 a rating of 2 out of 5 stars: he praised its call quality and battery life and noted it was "a bargain at just £25", but found weaknesses in its lack of camera, lack of mobile data and "poor" CSTN LCD screen, concluding that it was not a "sensible budget buy".
