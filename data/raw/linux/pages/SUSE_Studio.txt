SUSE Studio was an online Linux software creation tool by SUSE. Users could develop their own Linux distro, software appliance, or virtual appliance, mainly choosing which applications and packages they want on their "custom" Linux and how it looks.
Users could choose between openSUSE or SUSE Linux Enterprise as a base and pick from a variety of pre-configured images including jeOS, minimal server, GNOME, and KDE desktops.
The SUSE Studio service was shut down on February 15, 2018.

On SUSE Gallery Archived 2018-04-22 at the Wayback Machine one can find a catalog of the images created in SUSE Studio. These are available for download as well as immediate deployment on the supported cloud platforms. Upon logging in, cloning and test-driving images is possible.
A number of projects, both related to the openSUSE Project and independent, use SUSE Gallery as the preferred way to get virtual- and disk images to their users.
SUSE Studio is what powered the fan-made ChromeOS, which was a semi-stripped-down system loaded with the developers' version of Google Chrome, Google web application links, and OpenOffice.org (not to be confused with Google's "ChromeOS").
The many desktop environments supported (not limited to):

brltty
JeOS

LXQt
GTK+ only
GNOME
