The Nokia 6600 fold was a clamshell-style mobile phone made by Nokia, and announced on 28 April 2008. The phone ran the Series 40 5th Edition platform and supported the 3G standard.
The phone had an external OLED display that brought up a clock and other information by double tapping, as also seen on Nokia 8800 Arte. Similarly to the Nokia 6131/6126, it had a flip opener mechanism with the key on the right hand side of the device.
The Nokia 6600 fold had a "sleek", metal construction with external mirror. It was sold in three color variants: blue, black (Mysterious Black) and purple (Sophisticated Purple). The Nokia 6600 slide shares the same design language but in a slider form.
