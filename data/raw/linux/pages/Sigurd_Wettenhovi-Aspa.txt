Georg Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa (born. Wetterhoff-Asp, 7 May 1870 – 18 February 1946) was a Finnish multiartist: painter, sculptor, writer, and a pseudo-linguist. He is best known for his fantastical theories about the past of the Finnish people, whom he believed to have descended from Ancient Egypt.
Born in Helsinki, his parents were Georg August Asp (1834–1901), professor of anatomy at the University of Helsinki and Mathilda Sofia Wetterhoff (1840–1920), developer of female gymnastics.
Wettenhovi-Aspa studied art in Copenhagen in the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1888 to 1891. He organized several art shows known as the Free Exhibitions. He died in Helsinki.
