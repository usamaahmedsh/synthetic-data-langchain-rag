LMMS (formerly Linux MultiMedia Studio) is a digital audio workstation application program. It allows music to be produced by arranging samples, synthesizing sounds, entering notes via computer keyboard or mouse (or other pointing device) or by playing on a MIDI keyboard, and combining the features of trackers and sequencers. It is free and open source software, written in Qt and released under GPL-2.0-or-later.


== System requirements ==
LMMS is available for multiple operating systems, including Linux, OpenBSD, macOS, and Windows. It requires a 1.5 GHz CPU, 1 GB of RAM and a two-channel sound card.


== Program features ==
LMMS accepts soundfonts and GUS patches, and it supports the Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API (LADSPA) and LV2 (only master branch, since 24.05.2020). It can use VST plug-ins on Win32, Win64, or Wine32. The nightly versions support LinuxVST. Currently MacOS doesn't support them.
It can import Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and Hydrogen files and can read and write customized presets and themes.
Audio can be exported in the WAV, FLAC, Ogg and MP3 file formats.
Projects can be saved in the compressed MMPZ file format or the uncompressed MMP file format.


== Editors ==
Song Editor – for arranging instruments, samples, groups of notes, automation, and more
Beat+Bassline Editor – for quickly sequencing rhythms
FX Mixer – for sending multiple audio inputs through groups of effects and sending them to other mixer channels, infinite channels are supported
Piano Roll – edit patterns and melodies
Automation Editor – move almost any knob or widget over the course of the song


== Audio plug-ins ==
LMMS includes a variety of audio plug-ins that can be drag-and-dropped onto instrument tracks in the Song Editor and Beat+Bassline Editor.
