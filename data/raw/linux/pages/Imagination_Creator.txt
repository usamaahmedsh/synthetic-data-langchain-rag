Creator is a family of single-board computers developed by Imagination Technologies to promote educational research and software development based on the MIPS architecture. The first board in the platform, the Creator Ci20, was released in August 2014. A second development kit called Creator Ci40 was introduced through a Kickstarter campaign in November 2015.


== Hardware ==


=== Creator Ci20 ===
The Creator Ci20 board is based on an Ingenic JZ4780 mobile-class application processor, which contains a dual-core 1.2 GHz MIPS32 CPU with 32k I&D L1 cache and 512k L2 cache and an IEEE754 Floating Point Unit, coupled with a PowerVR SGX540 GPU. This processor supports MXU, a 32-bit SIMD extension. In addition, the board provides:

8 GB of flash and 1 GB of DDR3 SDRAM memory
Video playback up to 1080p
AC97 audio, via 4-pin input/output jack and HDMI connector
Camera interface – ITU645 controller
Connectivity – 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0
HDMI output up to 2K resolution
2 x USB – host and OTG
14-pin EJTAG connector
2 x UART, GPIO, SPI, I2C, ADC, expansion headers


=== Creator Ci40 ===
The Creator Ci40 board  is based on a cXT200 chip optimized specifically for IoT applications which contains a dual-core, dual-threaded 550 MHz MIPS interAptiv CPU with 32k I&D L1 cache and 512k L2 cache and an IEEE754 Floating Point Unit coupled with an Ensigma C4500 Wi-Fi radio processor. In addition, the board provides:
