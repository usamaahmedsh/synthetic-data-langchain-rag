lsmod is a command on Linux systems that lists each loadable kernel module that is loaded.
Example output from lsmod:

The Module column contains the name of a module. The Size column indicates the size in bytes of a module (not memory used). The Used by column indicates how many times the module is in use by running programs. To the right of that is a list of other modules which refer to this one, but this list is sometimes incomplete. If the module controls its own unloading via a can_unload routine then the used-by count shows as -1, irrespective of the actual count.
