Nokia Originals is a line of feature phones produced since 2017 by HMD Global, the exclusive licensee for Nokia branded mobile devices. It consists of modern revivals of past Nokia mobile phones. All include features such as keypads with non-touchscreen displays, cameras with flash, expandable memory, Bluetooth and FM radios. Some models have 4G modems, while some run on KaiOS and therefore provide extras such as Wi-Fi, GPS and more web services.
