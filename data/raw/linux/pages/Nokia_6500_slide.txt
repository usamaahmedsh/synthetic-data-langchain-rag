The Nokia 6500 slide is a slider feature phone released in 2007 by the Finnish company Nokia. The phone runs the Nokia Series 40 platform. It is the slider variant of the 6500 Classic, and more multimedia focused.


== Design ==
The case is made of brushed stainless steel with piano black plastic accents on the bottom. On the front, there is a D-pad mainly used for navigation with a trigger button in center, accompanied by a set of selection buttons (that can also be assigned shortcuts) and call keys. A camera shortcut and a volume rocker is placed on the right side, with the camera shortcut also functioning as a shutter key. The key design follows a minimalist approach, with bars favored over icons.
A rubberized grip is placed beneath the display for sliding the upper housing. On top, there's a notch containing the video camera, the earpiece grill and the light sensor.
The keypad is illuminated and contains standard keys, as well as a browser and silent mode shortcut.
The overall design is well-received by critics.


== Interface ==
The 6500 Slide runs Nokia's S40 5th Edition with Feature Pack 1 (with the latest firmware), being one of the first to come with 5th Edition. The UI is praised by critics for its speed and simplicity.
