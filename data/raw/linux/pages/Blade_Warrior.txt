== Gameplay ==
The game is a mix of adventuring and battling, in which players are tasked with collecting magical items and exploring the landscape of the game via the in-game map while fighting off enemies. Various facilities in the game are accessible only when a certain number of artifacts have been collected. A notable feature of Blade Warrior is the graphical interface: all objects in the game are seen in silhouette, except for obtainable items, and the effects of magic spells. The background is made up of a night sky, with clouds and hills, etc.


== Plot ==
The world has been enslaved by Murk, and players are challenged to free it by collecting the seven fragments of a tablet which are in the possession of seven wizards who inhabit seven towers.
