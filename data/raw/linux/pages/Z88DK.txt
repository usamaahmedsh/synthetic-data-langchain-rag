Z88DK is a Small-C-derived cross compiler for a long list of Z80-based computers. The name derives from the fact that it was originally developed to target the Cambridge Z88. Z88DK is a collection of software development tools that targets the 8080 and Z80 families of machines. It allows the development of programs in C, assembly language, or any mixture. What makes z88dk unique is its ease of use, built-in support for many Z80 machines, and its extensive set of assembly language library subroutines implementing the C standard and extensions.
It has been used for many software and hardware projects, notably the REX DK (targeted to the REX 6000 platform) and the S1 SDK (targeted to the S1 MP3 Player) teams.
The compiler is highly portable, and is known to run on AmigaOS, BeOS, HP-UX 9, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, Win64, Win32, Win16, and MS-DOS.
