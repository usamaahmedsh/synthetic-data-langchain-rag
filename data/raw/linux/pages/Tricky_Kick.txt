== Reception ==

Tricky Kick received average reviews. GamePro's C.T. Asian wrote that it is "an extensive and challenging game that's great to take on with an audience. It's one of those carts that's bound to stir up a lot of group participation - everyone has their own strategy". Nevertheless, C.T. Asian criticized the poor translation of the text from Japanese.
