GTK (formerly GIMP ToolKit and GTK+) is a free open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) targeted at Linux and specifically GNOME (though with some use in other desktop environments). It is licensed under the terms of the GNU LGPL, allowing both free and proprietary software to use it.
The GTK team releases new versions on a regular basis. GTK 4 and GTK 3 are actively maintained, while GTK 2 is no longer supported. GTK 1 is independently maintained by the CinePaint project.


== Software architecture ==

The GTK library contains a set of graphical control elements (widgets); version 3.22.16 contains 186 active and 36 deprecated widgets. GTK is an object-oriented widget toolkit written in the programming language C; it uses GObject (that is, the GLib object system) for object orientation. While GTK is mainly used with windowing systems based on Wayland (and prior to that on Wayland's predecessor X11), it works on other platforms, including Microsoft Windows (interfaced with the Windows API), and macOS (interfaced with Quartz). There is also an HTML5 back-end named Broadway, although this was deprecated in 2025 with the X11 backend to indicate both would be removed in GTK version 5. GTK uses Vulkan or GL to draw most graphical elements.
GTK can be configured to change the look of the widgets drawn; this is done using different display engines. Several display engines exist which try to emulate the look of the native widgets on the platform in use.


=== GTK Drawing Kit (GDK) ===

GDK acts as a wrapper around the low-level functions provided by the underlying windowing and graphics systems.


=== GTK Scene Graph Kit (GSK) ===

GSK is the rendering and scene graph API for GTK. GSK lies between the graphical control elements (widgets) and the rendering. GSK was finally merged into GTK version 3.90 released March 2017.


=== GtkBuilder ===
GtkBuilder allows user interfaces to be designed without writing code. The interface is described in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file which is written by hand or generated by a GUI designer, which is then loaded at runtime and the objects created automatically. The description of the user interface is independent from the programming language being used.


=== Language bindings ===

Language bindings are available for using GTK from languages other than C, including C++, Genie, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Vala, and others.


=== Backends ===
GTK supports various backends, which provides different ways to display GTK applications depending on the system and environment. Examples of GTK backends are:

Wayland – Used with the Wayland display server on some Unix-like systems, it is a modern replacement for X11.
X11 – The default on Unix-like systems using the X.Org display server.
Win32 – For running GTK applications on Windows.
Quartz – For macOS support.
Broadway – Allows GTK applications to run in web browsers using HTML5 and WebSocket.


== Development tools ==


=== GUI designers ===

There are several GUI designers for GTK. Here is a selection of GTK GUI designers:

Cambalache - a successor to Glade, supports GTK 4.
Glade - supports GtkBuilder, which is a GTK built-in GUI description format. (not actively maintained)
Gazpacho - GUI builder for the GTK toolkit written in Python
Crow Designer - relies on its own GuiXml format and GuiLoader library.
Stetic - part of MonoDevelop, oriented toward Gtk#.
Gambas (since version 2.0 atop BASIC)
Xojo
Lazarus (on Linux defaults to interfacing with GTK 2)


=== GTK Inspector ===

The GTK Inspector is a built-in interactive debugging tool in GTK, allowing developers to inspect and modify UI elements, test CSS changes, and analyze widget structure in real time. It can be enabled using the Control + Shift + I or Control + Shift + D shortcuts, or by setting the GTK_DEBUG=interactive environment variable. It was introduced with GTK version 3.14.


==== Features ====
Interactive debugging
Real-time CSS testing and modifications
Widget magnification for detailed inspection
UI structure analysis and object property examination
Customizable display settings via environment variables
Detailed object inspection (type, state, properties, CSS, actions, etc.)
Global application information display
CSS rule debugging
Rendering pipeline recording and inspection


== Development ==
GTK is mainly developed by The GNOME Project, which also develops the GNOME Development Platform and the GNOME Desktop Environment. GTK is mainly written in C. Many language bindings are available.
GNOME developers and users gather at an annual GNOME Users And Developers European Conference GUADEC meeting to discuss GNOME's current state and future direction. GNOME incorporates standards and programs from freedesktop.org to better interoperate with other desktops.
Many GNOME applications have been ported to GTK 4, which was released in December 2020, however some still use GTK+ 3 (GIMP being a major one).


=== Build automation ===
The master branch of GTK utilizes Meson for its build automation. GTK (and GNOME, GLib, etc.) formerly utilized the GNU Build System (named Autotools) as the build automation system of choice. Since August 14, 2017, the Autotools build system files have been dropped.


== Criticism ==
The most common criticism of GTK is the lack of backward-compatibility in major updates, most notably in the application programming interface (API) and theming. The result is that application developers or theme developers have to rewrite parts of their code to make it work with a newer version of GTK.
The compatibility breaks between minor releases during the GTK 3.x development cycle was explained in 2013 by Benjamin Otte as due to strong pressures to innovate, such as providing the features modern users expect and supporting the increasingly influential Wayland display server protocol. With the release of GTK 4, the pressure from the need to innovate will have been released and the balance between stability and innovation will tip toward stability. Similarly, recent changes to theming are specifically intended to improve and stabilise that part of the API, meaning some investment now should be rewarded later. However, in 2025, GTK 5 is described in the official documentation as "a major new version of GTK that breaks both API and ABI compared to GTK 4.x.", like GTK 3 and 4.

Aurélien Gâteau started Gwenview as GTK application but switched to Qt early in development.
Dirk Hohndel, codeveloper of Subsurface and member of Intel's Open-Source Technology Center, criticized the GTK developers for being abrasive and ignoring most community requests.
Hong Jen Yee, the creator of LXDE, expressed disdain for the GTK3 toolkit's radical breaking API changes and increased memory usage, leading him to port the project to Qt, renaming it LXQt.
The Audacious music player moved to Qt in version 3.6. The reasons stated by the developers for this include a transition to client-side window decorations, which they claim cause the application to look "GNOME-y and out of place."
Wireshark has switched to Qt due to not having a good experience with GTK's cross-platform support.
EasyEffects, a popular audio equalizer, is being ported to Qt.

GTK programs can be run on desktop environments based on X11 and Wayland, or others including ones not made with GTK, provided the needed libraries are installed; this includes macOS if X11.app is installed. GTK can be also run on Microsoft Windows. It is used by some popular cross-platform applications like Pidgin and GIMP. wxWidgets, a cross-platform GUI toolkit, uses GTK on Linux by default. Other ports include DirectFB (for example used by the Debian installer).


=== Desktop environments ===

Several desktop environments utilize GTK as the widget toolkit.


==== Current ====
GNOME, based on GTK, meaning that programs native to GNOME use GTK
Budgie, built from scratch for the SolusOS successor, Solus Operating System
Cinnamon, a fork of GNOME 3 which uses GTK version 3
MATE, a fork of GNOME 2 which uses GTK 3 since version 1.18
Xfce, based on GTK 3 since version 4.14
Pantheon uses GTK 3 & 4, being developed by elementary OS
Sugar, a desktop environment for youth primary education, which uses GTK, especially PyGTK
Phosh, a mobile UI designed for PureOS
LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is based on GTK 2
Unity, the former default desktop environment of Ubuntu


==== Inactive ====
Access Linux Platform (successor of the Palm OS PDA platform)
Consort, the GNOME 3.4 Fallback Mode – fork from Solus
GPE, the GPE Palmtop Environment
ROX Desktop, a lightweight desktop, with features from the GUI of RISC OS


=== Window managers ===
The following window managers use GTK:


=== GtkSourceView ===
For syntax highlighting there is GtkSourceView, "source code editing widget". GtkSourceView is maintained by GNOME separately from GTK as a library: gtksourceview. There are plans to rename to gsv.


=== GtkSpell ===
GtkSpell is a library separate from GTK. GtkSpell depends on GTK and Enchant. Enchant is a wrapper for ispell, hunspell, etc., the actual spell checker engine/software. GtkSpell uses GTK's GtkTextView widget, to highlight misspelled words and offer replacement.


== History ==
GTK was originally designed and used in the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) as a replacement of the Motif toolkit; at some point Peter Mattis became disenchanted with Motif and began to write his own GUI toolkit named the GIMP toolkit and had successfully replaced Motif by the 0.60 release of GIMP. Finally GTK was re-written to be object-oriented and was renamed GTK+. This was first used in the 0.99 release of GIMP. GTK was subsequently adopted for maintenance by the GNOME Foundation, which uses it in the GNOME desktop environment.


=== GTK 2 ===
The GTK 2.0.0 release (2002) series introduced new features which include improved text rendering using Pango, a new theme engine, improved accessibility using the Accessibility Toolkit, transition to Unicode using UTF-8 strings, and a more flexible API. Starting with version 2.8, released in 2005, GTK 2 depends on the Cairo graphics library for rendering vector graphics. 


=== GTK 3 ===
GTK version 3.0.0 (2011) included revised input device handling, support for themes written with CSS-like syntax, and the ability to receive information about other opened GTK applications. All rendering was done using Cairo.
The '+' was dropped returning to simply 'GTK' in February 2019 during a Hackathon.


=== GTK 4 ===
Release of the first GTK 4 version was in December 2020. At the 2018 edition of DevConf.cz, Matthias Clasen gave an overview of the then-current state of GTK 4 development, including a high-level explanation of how rendering and input worked in GTK 3, what changes were being made to GTK 4, and the reasons for those changes. Examples of things that have become possible with GTK 4 were given as well.
One of the main changes made during the GTK 4 development cycle (i.e. GTK 3.92, etc.) was the removal of user customization options (like individual keyboard shortcuts that could be set in GTK+ 2), and the delegation of functionality to ancillary objects instead of encoding it into the base classes provided by GTK. Other changes include:

Event handling from signal handlers described by GtkWidget is delegated to event controllers.
Rendering is delegated to GtkSnapshot objects.
The layout mechanism is delegated from GtkWidget to GtkLayoutManager.
Cairo was de-emphasized and Vulkan or GL were used instead to draw most graphical elements.
