Papyrus is an open-source UML 2 tool based on Eclipse and licensed under the EPL. It has been developed by the Laboratory of Model Driven Engineering for Embedded Systems (LISE) which is a part of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA-List).
Papyrus can either be used as a standalone tool or as an Eclipse plugin. It provides support for Domain Specific Languages and SysML. Papyrus is designed to be easily extensible as it is based on the principle of UML Profiles.
