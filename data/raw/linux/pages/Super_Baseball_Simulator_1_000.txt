Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 is a 1991  traditional baseball simulation video game by Culture Brain for the Super NES that is the sequel to the NES game Baseball Simulator 1.000. This game is called Super Ultra Baseball (スーパーウルトラベースボール) in Japan.
In the game, there are three leagues: Atlantic, Northern, and Ultra. Each league has six teams. In the Ultra League, pitchers and batters have special power-ups that boost their abilities which gives the game a surrealistic feel that is rare in the sports genre. Players can even create their own baseball teams and assign special moves to the players that they name themselves. The game can be played in exhibition mode and season mode.
In May 2021, Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 was added to the Nintendo Classics service.
