balenaEtcher (commonly referred to and formerly known as Etcher) is a free and open-source utility used for writing image files such as .iso and .img files, as well as zipped folders onto storage media to create live SD cards and USB flash drives. It is developed by Balena, and licensed under Apache License 2.0. Etcher allows users to write images to portable storage media such as USB flash drives and SD cards. Etcher was developed using the Electron framework and supports Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems. balenaEtcher was originally called Etcher, but its name was changed on October 29, 2018, when Resin.io changed its name to Balena.


== Features ==
Etcher is primarily used through a graphical user interface, but there is also a command-line interface available for download on GitHub.
Future planned features include support for persistent storage allowing live SD card or USB flash drive to be used as a hard drive, as well as support for flashing multiple boot partitions to a single SD card or USB flash drive.
