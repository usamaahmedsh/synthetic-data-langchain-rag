Wife carrying (Finnish: eukonkanto or akankanto, Estonian: naisekandmine, Swedish: kärringkånk) is a contest in which competitors race while each carrying a partner. Whilst most teams consist of a man carrying a woman there are generally no rules about gender or marital status. The objective is for the runner to carry their team-mate through a special obstacle track in the fastest time. The sport was first introduced in 1992 in Sonkajärvi, Finland.
Several types of carrying may be practised: either a classic piggyback, a fireman's carry (over the shoulder), or Estonian-style ("wife" upside-down on his back with their legs over the neck and shoulders).


== History ==

Eukonkanto originated in Finland. Tales have been passed down of a man named Herkko Rosvo-Ronkainen (aka Ronkainen the Robber). This man was thought to be a robber in the late 1800s who lived in a forest. He supposedly ran around with his gang of thieves causing harm to villagers. From what has been found, there are three ideas as to why/how this sport was invented. Firstly, that Rosvo-Ronkainen and his thieves were accused of stealing food and abducting women from villages in the area he lived in, then carrying these women on their backs as they ran away (hence the "wife" or woman carrying). The second suggestion is that young men would go to neighbouring villages, and abduct women to forcibly marry, often women who were already married. These wives were also carried on the backs of the young men; this was referred to as "the practice of wife stealing". Lastly, is the idea that Rosvo-Ronkainen trained his thieves to be "faster and stronger" by carrying big, heavy sacks on their backs, from which this sport evolved. Though the sport is often considered a joke, competitors take it very seriously, just like any other sport.
Wife carrying contests have taken place in Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, India, Germany, the UK and other parts of the world besides Finland and nearby Sweden, Estonia and Latvia, and the sport has a category in the Guinness Book of Records.


== Rules ==
The original course was a rough, rocky terrain with fences and brooks, but it has been altered to suit modern conditions. There is now sand instead of full rocks, fences, and some kind of area filled with water (a pool). These are the following rules set by the International Wife Carrying Competition Rules Committee:

The most important rule is to have fun when carrying a wife
The length of the official track is 253.5 metres (832 ft).
The track has two dry obstacles and a water obstacle about one metre deep.
The wife to be carried may be your own, or the neighbour's, or you may have found her further afield; the wife must, however, be over 17 years of age.
The wife is a gender free term that is used over the carried person (Gender rule changed in February 2023)
The minimum weight of the wife to be carried is 49 kilograms (108 lb). If she weighs less than 49 kg, she will be burdened with a rucksack containing additional weight to bring the total load to be carried up to 49 kg.
All participants must enjoy themselves.
The only equipment allowed is a belt worn by the carrier and a helmet worn by the carried.
The contestants run the race two pairs at a time, so each heat is a contest in itself.
Each contestant takes care of his/her safety and, if deemed necessary, insurance.
The contestants have to pay attention to the instructions given by the organizers of the competition.
There is only one category in the World Championships, and the winner is the couple who completes the course in the shortest time.
Also, the most entertaining couple, the best costume, and the strongest carrier will be awarded a special prize.
While the International rules are the basis for all competitions, rules and prizes do vary for each competition.
The Wife Carrying World Championships have been held annually in Sonkajärvi, Finland, since 1992 (where the prize is the wife's weight in beer).
The Sonkajärvi Wife Carrying Ltd (Sonkajärven Eukonkanto Oy in Finnish) owns the trade mark Wife Carrying (Eukonkanto in Finnish) and has official partners globally who have the right to hold licensed wife carrying competitions.
