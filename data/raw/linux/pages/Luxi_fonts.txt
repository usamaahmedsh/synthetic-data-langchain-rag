Luxi is a family of typefaces originally designed for the X Window System by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow from Bigelow & Holmes Inc. The Luxi typefaces are similar to Lucida – their previous font design.
Luxi fonts were once commonly distributed with free software operating systems, such as Linux. They were featured as the default fonts for Red Hat's Bluecurve theme. Released under a licence which permits free distribution but not modification, the Luxi fonts are not free software.  This led to their removal from Debian package of XFree86 as well as Fedora.
