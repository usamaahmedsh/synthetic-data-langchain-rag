== Biography ==
Love was born in 1981 in south Florida. He attended and graduated from Charles W. Flanagan High School. For his undergraduate studies, he attended the University of Florida, where he graduated with both a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
While still in college, Love was employed as a kernel hacker at MontaVista Software. At MontaVista, he worked on procps and several kernel-related projects, including one of his most notable, the preemptive kernel.
Love began work at Ximian on December 15, 2003, where he first served as Senior Engineer in the Linux Desktop Group. At Ximian, he spearheaded an effort, named Project Utopia, to better integrate hardware management into the Linux desktop. After Ximian's acquisition by Novell, Love rose to the position of Chief Architect of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop. At Novell, he worked on various kernel and GNOME projects, including inotify and Beagle.
Love resigned from Novell on May 4, 2007, to work at Google on their mobile device platform, Android. Joining the project before it was announced, he engineered several kernel and system-level solutions for Android, including its novel shared memory subsystem, ashmem. Love worked at Google as Director of Engineering for Search Infrastructure through May 2021. Love now works as VP of Engineering at Toast where he builds cloud platforms for restaurants.
Love lives in Boston, Massachusetts.
