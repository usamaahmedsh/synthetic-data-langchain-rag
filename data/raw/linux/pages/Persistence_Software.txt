== History ==
Persistence Software was founded in 1991 by Derek Henninger, Christopher Keene, and Richard Jensen in San Mateo, California.
The company started life as a spinoff from Lighthouse Design. As the original NeXTSTEP computer shipped with a relational database and Objective-C, Lighthouse engineers created a simple mapping utility called Exploder to store objects in a relational database.
The Persistence team worked with Stanford University's professors Gio Wiederhold and Arthur M Keller, who was the chief technical advisor, to extend the object-relational mapping technology by adding the concepts of mapping related objects.
Persistence created a series of products that integrated object-to-relational mapping, caching, and cache synchronization with automated cache management.
The products were marketed under the names PowerTier, EdgExtend, and DirectAlert.
Sun Microsystems licensed the Persistence technology in 1998, which was later incorporated into the Enterprise JavaBeans standard.
In 2004, Progress Software bought Persistence for $16 million.
