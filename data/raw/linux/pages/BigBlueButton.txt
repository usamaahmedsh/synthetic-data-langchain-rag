BigBlueButton is a virtual classroom software program designed for online education. It is accessed through Learning Management Systems, providing engagement tools and analytics which enable educators to interact with their students remotely. BigBlueButton is open source, except for some versions of its database software.


== History ==
The project was started at Carleton University in 2007 by the Technology Innovation Management program.
The first version, initially referred to as the Blindside project, was written by Richard Alam under the supervision of Tony Bailetti. BigBlueButton is an affiliate member of the Open Source Initiative. The BigBlueButton name derives from the idea  that starting a web conference should be as simple as "pressing a (metaphorical) big blue button".
In 2009, Richard Alam, Denis Zgonjanin, and Fred Dixon uploaded the BigBlueButton source code to Google Code and formed Blindside Networks, a company pursuing the traditional open source business model of providing paid support and services to the BigBlueButton community.
In 2010, the core developers added a whiteboard for annotating the uploaded presentation. Jeremy Thomerson added an application programming interface (API) which the BigBlueButton community subsequently used to integrate with Sakai, WordPress,  Moodle 1.9,  Moodle 2.0, Joomla, Redmine, Drupal, Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware, Foswiki, and LAMS. Google accepted BigBlueButton into the 2010 Google Summer of Code program. To encourage contributions from others, the core developers moved the source code from Google Code to GitHub. The project indicated its intent of creating an independent, not-for-profit BigBlueButton Foundation to oversee future development.
In 2011, the core developers announced that they were adding record and playback capabilities to BigBlueButton 0.80.
In 2020, the project released BigBlueButton 2.2, a full rewrite of the client and server to support HTML5.
In March 2020, BigBlueButton 2.2 was awarded by the President of the ENTD, Pasquale Aiello, as the best web conferencing system and used in the project UNIOPEN, approved by the European Commission for Digital Skills and Job Coalition action plan.
In 2021, version 2.3 was released. BigBlueButton continued to depend on MongoDB, which became proprietary in version 3.6 and later, released in 2018. BigBlueButton 2.3 is the first which recommends using a proprietary MongoDB version but remains compatible with the free software 3.4 MongoDB.
In 2022, BigBlueButton was directly embedded into the Moodle 4.0 core, the largest Learning Management System. It also released two new updates that included BigBlueButton 2.4 in January and BigBlueButton 2.5 in late September. BigBlueButton continues to be used by organizations including the Ministry of National Education (France), the Air Education and Training Command, not-for-profits such as School on Wheels, and schools throughout the world for remote learning and teaching.


== Architecture ==
As a web page application, the BigBlueButton frontend uses React and the backend uses MongoDB and Node.js. It also uses Redis to maintain an internal list of its meetings, attendees, and any other relevant information. As of version 2.5, the server runs on Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit and can be installed either from packages or an install script.


== Adoption among non-profits ==
In 2020, BigBlueButton was adopted by many FLOSS focused non-profits including Wikimedia Australia, Constant vzw and new FLOSS focused coops like Catalan's The Online Meeting Cooperative. In France it is recommended since May 2020 by the Digital Interministry Direction defining the state's information and communication systems.
