== Products ==
Dejal's first products were for Apple's System 7; today, the company's products are developed exclusively for Mac OS X. Older software for Mac OS 9 and earlier are still available as freeware, but are no longer supported.
In 2002, Dejal released version 1.0 of Simon, a server monitoring tool. Simon can perform a variety of tests, such as pinging a server or checking the content of a web page for changes, at user-specified intervals, and report on the results of the tests. Version 2.1 of the software was rated 3.5 out of 5 by Macworld, which praised the software's extensive notification and report options. The current version is 4.0.3.
In 2006, Dejal released version 1.0 of Caboodle, which is designed to collect and organize small pieces of information, which may be simply text (such as a shopping list or a snippet of code) or more complex items, such as images and internet links. Macworld rated version 1.3.1 of the software 2.5 out of 5, noting in its review that the software was built on a "superb concept" while being somewhat difficult to use and prone to bugs.
