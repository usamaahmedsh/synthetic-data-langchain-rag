The COOL-ER is a discontinued e-book reader from UK company Interead. The device is compatible with both Mac and Windows computers, comes in a variety of colors, and supports e-books in English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, French, Dutch, Russian, Korean, Ukrainian, Mandarin and Japanese. The device is commonly compared with the Amazon Kindle. Reviewers cite the lower price, MP3 support, and lighter weight as advantages; but complain of the COOL-ER's lack of wireless connectivity and button insensitivity. On 8 June 2010, Interead went into liquidation after failing to secure funding.
