James Bond Jr. is an American animated television series based on Ian Fleming's James Bond. Produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson in association with United Artists and Danjaq, the show follows the adventures of James Bond's nephew, James Bond Jr. It premiered on September 16, 1991, and ran for 65 episodes before concluding on December 13. It is the first and only animated spin-off within the franchise.


== Background ==
In February 1988, Variety reported that screenwriter Kevin McClory was producing an animated series titled James Bond vs S.P.E.C.T.R.E. with an unnamed Dutch company. This series never came to fruition. EON Productions later began development on James Bond Jr. alongside Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and MGM Television. It was officially licensed by Danjaq and United Artists, the rights holders of the James Bond franchise. It was the first successful attempt to bring the series to television since the 1954 adaptation of Casino Royale.
The show features James Bond Jr., who, while attending Warfield Academy, works alongside his friends—IQ, the grandson of Q; Gordo Leiter, the son of Felix Leiter; and Tracy Milbanks—to combat the terrorist organization S.C.U.M. (Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem), a group modeled after SPECTRE. His catchphrase, "Bond, James Bond... Junior", is a nod to his uncle's famous introduction.
The series often surpasses the Bond films in terms of outlandish technology, though it notably lacks the violence associated with the franchise. Several villains from the films make recurring appearances, including Jaws, Nick Nack, Auric Goldfinger, and Oddjob. Many of the episode titles parody those of the original movies.
