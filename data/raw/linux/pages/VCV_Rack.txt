VCV Rack is a free and open-source cross-platform software modular synthesizer.


== Overview ==
VCV Rack is a free open-source virtual modular synthesizer: multiple modules can be connected to synthesize a sound. By default, the software contains several VCOs, LFOs, mixers, and other standard synthesizer modules. However, more can be added as plugins through the VCV Rack website.
Version 1.0.0 added a stable API, a multithreading engine and support for polyphonic signals.
Version 2.0.0 was officially announced in September 2021 and released on November 30, 2021.


=== Interconnectivity ===
In addition to the above features, VCV Rack can also connect to other hardware and software by outputting analog CV/gate and digital USB or MIDI signals. The software can also connect to other VST plugins though the module "host". The ability to use VCV Rack itself as a VST plugin within other audio applications was added upon the release of Rack 2.0.
