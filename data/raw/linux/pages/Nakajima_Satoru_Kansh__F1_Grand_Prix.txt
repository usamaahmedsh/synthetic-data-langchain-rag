Nakajima Satoru Kanshū F1 Grand Prix (中嶋悟監修 Ｆ１ ＧＲＡＮＤ ＰＲＩＸ; "Supervisor Satoru Nakajima F1 Grand Prix") is a 1991 Sega Mega Drive Formula One video game based on the career of Satoru Nakajima, who was the first full-time Japanese racer in the history of Formula One. In fact, this was the first game that Nakajima endorsed for a Japanese video gaming system. The entire 1991 Formula One season can be re-enacted with any of the notable contenders from the prestigious Formula One racing organization.


== Gameplay ==


=== General gameplay ===
The action is viewed from the top and practice sessions can be done before actually racing. Player's name is entered using ASCII letters that are traditionally used for the English language, but the options and track details are in Japanese and literacy is required in order to understand the rules and principles of the game.

In the season mode, the player makes up the last name of his character. He must audition for a team and must qualify for all of his races on time. If the player fails to qualify for a race, he automatically receives zero points and sees a picture of himself looking at the night time sky. Each teams has requirements and if they are not met, then the player is fired from the racing team. Depending on how good a player qualifies in the test teack (known in the game as Auto Police), either many or few teams will be knocking on the player's metaphorical door. Different teams have different requirements in order to stay employed. Unlike its sequel F1 Super License: Nakajima Satoru, going to the pit stop is needed to do repairs on the car. Repairing the car can either be set to automatic or manual on the setup menu.
Transmission can also be shifted from manual transmission to automatic transmission, but the player still needs to shift from neutral to first gear even while in automatic transmission, like in most Formula One games. The maximum number of laps that can be attempted is five. The five-lap rules applies to practice, qualifying, in addition to the actual race itself.

Perrari (Ferrari) (automatic transmission)
This car is competitive, it only has the advantage when there is fast cornering. The car has automatic transmission and is easy to manage.
Muken (Mugen) (4-speed manual transmission)
It is a medium-fast speed car and has high speed, but its acceleration is different. The rest is all balanced and decent. This car is the ace in medium-fast or medium-slow curves.
Suharu (Subaru) (4-speed manual transmission)
It is the game's car, but it fails on acceleration and speed. The player doesn't have an advantage in anything. In addition, the Suharu is easy to move forward.
