== Major features ==


=== UMA ===
Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) allows mobile devices to utilize a wireless router to make phone calls.  The phone and router are recognized as being similar to a phone and GSM tower by the carrier's system. This allows for seamless handoffs between the router and the GSM tower at the point where the device is no longer in range of the router.


=== 802.11b/g WiFi ===
A WiFi connection for data transfer to the service provider means downloading content such as ringtones, games and wallpapers moves considerably quicker than EDGE or GPRS speeds.


=== Music capability ===
The device includes a multi-format music player and an FM radio feature. Stereo output is accomplished through the 2.5 mm Nokia AV port at the bottom of the device or the Bluetooth A2DP provision. Operation of the FM radio requires a wired device to be attached to the AV port to function as the radio antenna. The music player supports MIDI, AAC, AAC+, enhanced AAC+, MP3, and WMA files. There is an equalizer to allow for some adjustment of the sound's tonal quality.


=== Photography and Videography ===
A 2.0 megapixel CMOS sensor is mated to a fixed focus lens without auxiliary lighting. Maximum resolution is 1600 x 1200. Digital zoom allows for in-camera cropping before taking the shot. The still image camera has High, Normal and Basic quality settings. Image size choices are 160 x 120, 320 x 240, 640 480, 800 x 600, 1280 x 960 and 1600 x 1200. Available effects are Normal, False Color, Grayscale, Sepia, Negative and Solarize. White Balance choices are Auto, Daylight, Tungsten and Fluorescent.
Video is shot through the same lens as still images. Video resolution choices are 176 x 144 and 128 x 96 and appear to be 15 frames per second. Video clip length choices are Maximum and Default. Default will produce a clip suitable for sending via MMS, or roughly less than 300KB. Other menu choices for video mirror those for still images. Both still and video images may be saved either to the phone memory or to the storage card.


== Other features ==


=== Browsing ===
Model 6301 includes an xHTML browser for internet browsing. It is capable of displaying many web pages as intended with some side-to-side scrolling. It handles mobile-designed web pages without scrolling. It handles google.com both in mobile and classic form without incident. The phone's rendering of Nokia.com was different from a desktop browser's rendering, which appears to strictly be an Adobe Flash Player related issue.


=== Connectivity ===
There is a mini USB plug behind a cover at the bottom of the device. Nokia does not specify if this device is USB 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 compliant. 
The Bluetooth radio is another avenue for connection. This device implements Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR supporting these profiles: A2DP, AVRCP, DUN, FTP, GAP, GAVDP, GOEP, HFP, HSP, OPP, SAP, SDAP, and SPP.
Sideloading of information may be accomplished by way of the microSD or micro SDHC card. This device supports up to 4 gigabytes.


=== Memory ===
Device memory is up to 30 megabytes for end user purposes. A Flash memory of 64 MB for handling the device firmware is also present.


== Nokia 6300 ==
The Nokia 6300 is virtually identical in exterior appearance to the Nokia 6301. There are several internal and functional differences causing it to occupy a different functional niche than is occupied by the Nokia 6301.


=== Memory ===
The user memory available is 7.8 MB. The microSD storage capacity is 2 GB.


=== Connectivity ===
Connectivity is limited to Bluetooth,  There is no 802.11b/g (WiFi) associated with this device.
