Spock is a Java testing framework capable of handling the complete life cycle of a computer program. It was initially created in 2008 by Peter Niederwieser, a software engineer with GradleWare. A second Spock committer is Luke Daley (also with Gradleware), the creator of the popular Geb functional testing framework.
