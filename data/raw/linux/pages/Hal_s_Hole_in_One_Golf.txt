HAL's Hole in One Golf is a golf video game developed and published by HAL Laboratory for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991.


== Summary ==
The game is essentially a standard 18-hole golf video game, which is played from a top-down perspective. Players can enter up to four characters (letters and numbers) for their name. Wind speeds are shown in meters per second. Water hazards notifications appear in big gray letters.
In addition to stroke and match play, players can obtain passwords that allow spectacular shots to be re-enacted as if they were the spectator (eagles, holes in one, and double eagles). Beginners can learn gameplay strategies from watching expert players while they use their hard-earned passwords. Mode 7 effects permits the usage of elevation in certain camera angles.


== Development ==
During the mid-1980s, various Hole in One video games were released in Japan by HAL Laboratory for the NEC PC88 and MSX. The Super Famicom version can be considered as the sequel to the Family Computer video game Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional released in 1988. The Japanese version was named after legendary Japanese golfer Jumbo Ozaki, who has played golf on a professional basis since 1973. Takashi Saitou designed the stages.
