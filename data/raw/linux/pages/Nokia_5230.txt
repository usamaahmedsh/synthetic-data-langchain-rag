A cost-reduced variant called the 5233 (5228 in some markets) was released in 2010. It also shares the same form factor as the base 5800 and 5230, but is further cut down as it lacks support for 3G networks.

In January 2010, Nokia announced that Ovi Maps will be available for free for certain smartphones which includes the Nokia 5230, thus enabling free offline voice guided navigation for more than 180 countries.
