== Nokia 7250i ==
The Nokia 7250i is a slightly improved version of the Nokia 7250, introduced in June 2003. It includes XHTML browser, OMA Forward lock digital rights management, zoom function to magnify images and a more advanced camera. The phone has exactly the same design as the 7250.  
The Nokia 6610i was essentially the same phone in terms of features, but featured a more conservative design to appeal more to business users while the 7250i was intended to be a fashion-oriented phone. The Nokia 3200 also had a similar feature set, however, the 3200 was intended to be a more affordable youth-oriented phone and featured a different style graphical user interface derived from that of the Nokia 3100.
