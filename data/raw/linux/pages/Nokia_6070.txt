== Known issues ==
When installing applications whose size is 130-150kb using the Nokia PC suite, an error message appears saying that the file is too large to be installed on the phone although the maximum size that can be installed on the Nokia 6070 is 150kb. Applications which have a size of 130-150kb can be installed via OTA (over-the-air) download using GPRS.
Sometimes, when the phone is using GPRS and the memory is about to become full (due to the internet cache being enabled), the phone crashes and White Screen of Death appears.
When accessing the text message inbox whilst receiving a text message at the same time, the phone crashes and the White Screen of Death appears.
Some users reported that they got a Nickel allergy because of too much exposure of the user's fingers to the navigation key which is made from nickel although, it is documented in the user's manual that users must avoid too much exposure to nickel which may lead to an allergic reaction. Several new Nokia phones in the market use the same navigation key as in Nokia 6070 to presumably cut cost.
