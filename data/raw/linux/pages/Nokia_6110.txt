The Nokia 6110 is a GSM mobile phone from Nokia announced on 18 December 1997 and released in 1998. It was a hugely popular follower of the Nokia 2110 (1994), and the first of the many Nokia 6xxx series business-targeted phones. Main improvements over the 2110 were reduced size and improved talk time. It was built on the new third generation, Nokia DCT3 hardware platform, and was the first GSM phone to use an ARM processor and the first running on Nokia's Series 20 user interface.
The phone shared the same platform as the Nokia 5110 targeted at the consumer market; unlike the 5110, however, it had the advanced user interface with menu icons (it was the first phone with this new interface that would become the future standard), and featured an infra-red port (once again being Nokia's first phone with it). It was also the first phone from Nokia to have the popular Snake game pre-installed.
It was succeeded/complemented by the similar but enhanced 6150.


== Variants ==

Nokia 6190 is a version of the phone for the North American market, although the infra-red port was removed. Several non-GSM variants were also released aimed at the North American market, including the 800 MHz D-AMPS 6120 (not to be confused with the Nokia 6120 classic), the 800/1900 MHz D-AMPS 6160, and the 800/1900 MHz CDMA 6185.  This was also known as the NK702 on the Orange UK network with a slightly different fascia, however the inside was identical. The GSM 1800 MHz variant was labeled 6130 and had the same exterior design changes, as the dual band GSM 900/1800 MHz 6150 model.
A license-built variant of the 6120 was manufactured and marketed by Gradiente in Brazil as the Gradiente Concept.
