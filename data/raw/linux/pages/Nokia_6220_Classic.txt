Nokia 6220 classic is a Symbian OS mobile phone announced by Nokia on 11 February 2008. It is notable for featuring a xenon flash for its 5-megapixel camera, similar to the Nokia N82 released a year prior. As such, it is often considered as a “budget” counterpart of the N82. Despite its compact size, it offers features comparable to the N series line-up, though it lacks Wi-Fi and a 3.5 mm audio jack, probably to cut design and production costs.
