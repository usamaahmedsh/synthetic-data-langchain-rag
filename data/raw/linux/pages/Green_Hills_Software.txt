Green Hills Software is a privately owned company that builds operating systems and programming tools for embedded systems. The firm was founded in 1982 by Dan O'Dowd and Carl Rosenberg. Its headquarters are in Santa Barbara, California.


== History ==
In the 1990s, Green Hills Software and Wind River Systems, both makers of embedded system software development tools, entered into a 99-year agreement to cooperatively support customers using products from both companies. The agreement was terminated after a lawsuit in 2005. After parting ways, Wind River publicly embraced Linux and open-source software while Green Hills initiated a public relations campaign decrying the use of open-source software in projects related to national security.
In 2008, the Green Hills real-time operating system (RTOS) named Integrity-178  was the first system to be certified by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), composed of National Security Agency (NSA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 6+.
In November 2008, it was announced that a commercialized version of Integrity 178-B would be offered to the private sector by Integrity Global Security, a subsidiary of Green Hills Software.
On March 27, 2012, a contract was announced between Green Hills Software and Nintendo. This designates MULTI as the official integrated development environment and toolchain for Nintendo and its licensed developers to program the Wii U video game console.
On February 25, 2014, it was announced that the operating system Integrity had been chosen by Urban Aeronautics for their AirMule flying car unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), since renamed the Tactical Robotics Cormorant.
