== Gameplay ==

The game allows players to do combat strategies with tanks, airplanes, military bases, and non-nuclear missiles. These advanced weapons allow players to stage a fictional World War III and to simulate modern warfare.
Players can assume the persona of various Hollywood action film stars like Sylvester Stallone (シルヴェスター・スタローン), Chuck Norris (チャックノリス), Eddie Murphy (エディマーフィー), Bruce Lee (ブルースリー), and Arnold Schwarzenegger (アーノルドシュワルツェネッガー). Stages include a jungle, forest, swamp, and urban terrain.
The player chooses a tank, and then must decide either to move a unit or destroy the enemy on sight. Destroyed units can be rebuilt for money and the first person to run out of cash loses the war. Both players are granted more than $250 million of virtual game currency to spend on military weapons to fire at each other.
