== History ==


=== 2010–2017: PLUS7 ===
PLUS7 was a catch up TV service run by the Seven Network through its Yahoo7 joint venture with Yahoo!. The service became available on 18 January 2010.
Some titles were exclusively available in Australia on PLUS7, including Other Space and Sin City Saints, as well as the British version of My Kitchen Rules, which were not broadcast on the Seven Network. In 2014, PLUS7 became the first commercial television catch-up service to provide optional closed captioning on most of its programming.
On 3 November 2015, PLUS7 launched a live streaming service called 7Live in time for Melbourne Cup day. In December 2015, 7live added Channel 7 digital channels, 7two and 7mate.
PLUS7 was available across several platforms including iOS mobile operating systems (e.g. iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch), Apple TV, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows 10, Sony internet-enabled TVs & Blu-ray players, LG internet-enabled TVs, Samsung internet-enabled TVs & Blu-ray players, Panasonic internet-enabled TVs, Hisense internet-enabled TVs, Humax set top boxes, Windows Mobile 7 & 8 and Samsung devices running Android OS 4.0+ and above.


=== 2017–present: 7plus ===
Following the acquisition of Yahoo! by Verizon Communications in June 2017, Seven announced plans to launch a wholly owned standalone service to replace PLUS7 within the following six months. In September 2017, Seven announced the new service would be known as 7plus and would launch in November 2017. With the introduction of 7plus, PLUS7 was shut down, becoming unavailable on most platforms from 12 December 2017, and on remaining devices on 31 March 2018.
In March 2019, the service added two American-based linear channels, Pac-12 Network and Outdoor Channel, as well as on-demand offerings from these providers.
On 23 July 2020, 7plus introduced a new logo styled as 7+.
On 4 August 2022, 7plus began airing Heartbreak Island, a reality television competition/contest, being deemed "too hot for TV".
