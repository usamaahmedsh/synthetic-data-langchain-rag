Hiri was (now defunct) a business focused desktop e-mail client for sending and receiving e-mails, managing calendars, contacts, and tasks. It was developed as an alternative to existing e-mail clients and calendar applications such as Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird.
Although Hiri was developed actively with many releases in primarily 2017 and the first half of 2018, there have been no new releases and no active development anymore since August 2018. Also, Hiri Suggestions, a dedicated subdomain for acquiring new ideas for development, has not received replies from the development since last year.
Hiri uses the cross-platform Qt framework to run on Windows, macOS and Linux. Hiri does not support IMAP and only uses Microsoft Exchange Server infrastructure.
Hiri has been funded by Telefonica, Delta Partners, ACT Venture Capital, Enterprise Ireland and Angel investors Facebook and LinkedIn.
In March 2017, Hiri began charging a subscription service ($39 yearly; $119 lifetime).
