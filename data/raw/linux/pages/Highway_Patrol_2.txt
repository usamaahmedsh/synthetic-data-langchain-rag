Highway Patrol 2 (shown on the title screen as Highway Patrol II) is a racing video game published by Microïds in 1991 for Atari ST, Amiga, and MS-DOS compatible operating systems. The player is a police officer trying to capture criminals before they reach the border of the state. The game begins with choosing a target, each one with different rewards: the tougher the criminal, the higher the reward will be. The game is played in a first-person view, with a map and a compass to help in locating the criminal. To arrest him, players may choose to use the soft way (siren), or the hard way (shotgun).
