8 Man (8エイトマン, Eitoman), Eightman (エイトマン), or 8th Man (1960s anime English dub) is a manga and superhero anime created in 1963 by science fiction writer Kazumasa Hirai and manga artist Jiro Kuwata. 8 Man is considered Japan's earliest cyborg superhero, predating Kamen Rider.
The manga was published in Weekly Shōnen Magazine and ran from 1963 to 1966. The anime series was produced by TCJ (nowadays Eiken). It was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System and ran from November 17, 1963, to December 31, 1964, with a total of 56 episodes, as well as a special "farewell" episode, "Goodbye, Eightman".


== Plot ==
Detective Azuma is murdered by criminals and his body is retrieved by Chief Tanaka (in the manga), or Dr. Tani (in the anime). In Tani's laboratory, Tani attempts to transfer Azuma's mind into an android body, an experiment that has already failed seven times. Azuma is reborn as the armour-skinned android 8 Man and is able to dash at impossible speeds as well as shape-shift into other people. He typically takes on the form of his former body, and keeps the fact that he is a robot secret from everyone, even his secretary Sachiko and his assistant Ichiro. To rejuvenate his powers, he smokes "power" cigarettes that he carries in a case on his belt.
The character's origin varies between the original manga, the TV series, and the live-action movie. In the 1992 movie, 8 Man's name before being murdered was "Detective Yokoda", and he is given the name "Detective Azuma" to cover up his death and revival. In the manga, Detective Azuma is trapped in a warehouse and gunned down, while the TV series has him killed when he is run over by a car. The manga has several origins for the name 8 Man, such as that this is Tani's eighth attempt to transfer a human mind, that the android body was given the designation "008" by the American military, or that there are seven regular police precincts in Tokyo and 8 Man is treated as a detective not belonging to any of them (thus, an unofficial eighth precinct).
The Japanese manga was presented as serial novella stories along with a set of one-shot stories. Many of these stories were edited down and adapted for the TV series. The novella stories were originally printed every week in Shukuu Shōnen Magazine in 16-page increments that consisted of 15 story pages and one title page. Ten additional one-shot stories were presented in seasonal and holiday specials of Shuukuu Shōnen Magazine. These stories were generally between 30 and 40 pages in length.
In the North American version of the 1960s anime series, the resurrected detective/android is known as "Tobor", the word "robot" spelled backwards. Dr. Tani is referred to as "Professor Genius" and the sobriquet of 8 Man is slightly changed to "8th Man," the name explained as he is the 8th attempt to be a super-robot. The story content was directed toward a wider audience of both young and adult viewers. As such, much of the violence was toned down for Western audiences.

The strip's artist Jiro Kuwata was imprisoned for possession of a handgun before the final 16-page serial of "The Demon Kozuma" was completed. The final serial was drawn by Takaharu Kusunoki for the magazine version. Jiro Kuwata later redrew the final pages of the story himself by request of Kazumasa Hirai and Rim Publishing, so that they could publish a complete version of the final story. The publishers were not able to use Kusunoki's artwork, so the story was omitted or left incomplete in previous official releases.

===== Theme song =====
There's a prehistoric monster who came from outer space


===== Release =====
Mental Brain Media released the first volume containing a few select episodes on February 25, 2019 under The Best of Tobor the 8th Man.


== Reception ==
8 Man was ranked ninth in the Mania Entertainment's 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes. The author of the ranking, Thomas Zoth, commented, "Before Cyborg 009, The Six Million Dollar Man, and RoboCop, there was 8 Man: The first cyborg manga and anime hero. Building on Astro Boy, 8 Man helped to shape the trajectory of robot and cyborg heroes for the next decade."


== Legacy ==
The 8 Man franchise was revived in the early 1990s with a live-action film, video game, and OVA series.


=== Video game ===
In 1991, SNK released a video game edition of Eight Man for the Neo Geo arcade and home video game system (both versions are identical), where the player took the role of 8 Man and his Robo-comrade 9 Man in a fight against an invading evil robot army. The game was released internationally. While the game stayed true to the concept of a crime-fighting super-robot, it was widely criticized for being tedious and relying too much on the gimmick of its speed-running effect.
In 2009, he appeared in the crossover Shonen Sunday & Shonen Magazine White Comic for the Nintendo DS.


=== Live action movie ===
In 1992, a live-action film version of 8 Man was produced in Japan. Titled 8 Man: For All Lonely Nights (8マン・すべての寂しい夜のために, Eitoman: Subete no Sabishī Yoru no Tame ni), released as simply 8 Man in some English and Spanish-speaking areas, it was directed by Yasuhiro Horiuchi and starred Kai Shishido as the title character and Toshihide Wakamatsu as Detective Yokoda. Distributed in the United States by Fox Lorber video simply as 8 Man, the movie was widely panned for its choppy editing, mediocre direction, and low-budget feel. Many modern American viewers, unfamiliar with the older animated series, felt the movie was an inferior version of RoboCop, although the latter was a much more recent franchise.


=== 8 Man After ===
In 1993, the mantle of 8 Man was taken up by Hazama Itsuru in the OVA series 8 Man After (エイトマン AFTER, Eitoman AFTER) . Animation was done by J.C. Staff with a total of four episodes.
Existing in a world far more corrupt than that of his predecessor, the new 8 Man had no qualms about being extremely violent towards the cybernetic criminals who had murdered him previously. It was licensed by Streamline Pictures where it went out of print until being released on DVD by Image Entertainment in 2001. It has since been released by Discotek Media in 2016 with Japanese audio, featuring English subtitles for the first time.
It's marketed for retail outside Japan by Enoki Films.


=== 8 Man Infinity ===
A manga sequel called 8 Man Infinity (8マンインフィニティ Eitoman Infiniti)  is being authored by Kyoichi Nanatsuki under Kodansha with six volumes published from 2005 to 2007. It was formerly serialized under Kodansha's Magazine Z.
On July 25, 2024, Star Fruit Books reported that the manga is licensed for an English release.


=== 8 Man vs. Cyborg 009 ===
A crossover between 8 Man and Cyborg 009 by Kyoichi Nanatsuki (script) and Masato Hayate (art), began serialization in Champion Red on July 18, 2020.
