Amazing Tater, known in Japan as Puzzle Boy II (パズルボーイII), is a puzzle video game for the Game Boy developed and published by Atlus. The game features a password system. It is the sequel to Kwirk.


== Gameplay ==

The player must guide a potato to the exit of each level, which consists of several obstacles. By pushing crates, the player fills up holes that can then be crossed. Different shaped crates and holes create puzzle like situations. The player must also manipulate rotation devices to reach the goal.
There are four different modes in the game. These include a practice mode, a "normal" puzzle mode, a mode specially designed for beginning players and an "action" mode containing two stories: Mega Picnic and Puzzle Forest.


== Reception ==
Contemporaneous reviews of Amazing Tater were generally positive. Most reviewers were complimentary of its charming presentation and moderate difficulty. Paul Rand writing for the magazine Go! said, "A-Mazing Tater has the same addictive qualities and, with a two-player option, a whole new challenge once you've completed the game on your own." Play Time called it, "a hot tip for fans of brain teasers and puzzle games!" The quality of the graphics were generally criticized but German publication Power Play called out the music as a highlight.
