Lingopie is a subscription-based video-on-demand (VOD) platform for language learning. Founded in 2018, Lingopie integrates interactive language learning tools with streaming content, featuring capabilities such as dual subtitles, video-based flashcards, and gamified review drills. The platform maintains a curated library of original productions and acquired international titles, including television shows, movies, and multimedia content in their original languages.
As of February 2025, Lingopie offers content in twelve languages: Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, English, Turkish, Dutch, Greek, Polish, and Hebrew. The platform is available on the web, mobile devices (Android and iOS), and smart TVs.


== History ==
Lingopie was founded by entrepreneurs David Datny and Roy Oppenheim after they met and discovered their similar experiences of learning a new language abroad through immersion. The concept originated when Datny moved to Israel and struggled with traditional Hebrew language lessons but noticed significant improvement when watching television with same-language captions. To make language learning more engaging, they developed the idea of creating an app that teaches languages through foreign television shows and movies.
After initial consultations with language academic Dr. Robert Vanderplank from the University of Oxford, who validated their approach to language learning, Lingopie was officially launched in 2019.
In March 2020, Lingopie secured seed funding from Entrée Capital and MassChallenge. The platform initially launched with Spanish and Russian content and gradually expanded its language offerings.
By 2021, Lingopie also added Portuguese, Italian, and German content. In the same year, Lingopie also rolled out its mobile application in the Google Play and Apple Store.
In April 2022, Lingopie added two Asian languages to its catalog: Japanese and Korean. The company also launched Lingopie Kids, a dedicated platform for children learning Spanish that features child-appropriate content while maintaining the core learning tools of the main platform. This was followed by the release of Lingopie Music, a free service that applies the platform’s language learning tools to music content.
By 2023, Lingopie had officially released its browser extension on Google Chrome and Safari, which initially allowed users to apply the platform’s language learning tools to selected third-party streaming content. The feature was discontinued in September 2025 as the company shifted its focus toward expanding its standalone applications and smart TV offerings.
In 2024, Lingopie expanded its platform by launching LingopieTV for smart TV devices and Lingopie Lessons for private language sessions. The company also enhanced its browser extension capabilities by adding support for selected Disney+ content.
Throughout 2025, Lingopie significantly expanded its content portfolio, launching Turkish and Dutch programming in the first half of the year, followed by Greek, Polish, and Hebrew content in mid-2025.


== Concept & Methodology ==
Lingopie employs an immersive language acquisition methodology integrating video-on-demand (VOD) content with interactive language learning tools and spaced repetition systems. The platform's primary pedagogical approach, known as “binge-learning,” synthesizes entertainment media consumption with structured language acquisition processes.
The methodology centers on authentic target-language content, including television programs, feature films, audiobooks, and podcasts, which expose learners to naturalistic language patterns, colloquialisms, and contextual grammar usage. This approach aligns with contemporary research on implicit language acquisition through meaningful input, as described in Krashen’s input hypothesis.
The "binge-learning” methodology structured by Lingopie operates through five progressive phases:

Silent Binge Phase: Initial exposure to native-level content through entertainment media
Interactive Phase: Content review using dual subtitles, translations, and interactive transcripts
Comprehension Phase: Reinforcement through games, quizzes, and interactive exercises
Speaking Phase: Oral practice through speech recognition and live sessions with native speakers
Advanced Fluency Phase: Progressive engagement with more complex native content
Lingopie’s core instructional design relies on dual-language subtitles. Every show includes two sets of subtitles, one in the user's native language and one in the target language. Users can click on the words they don't know and obtain an instant translation. All the words the users click on become flashcards that they can later review and study. Users can also play minigames and quizzes to review. The video player includes other language-learning tools to facilitate the learning process, such as different video speed options, grammar quizzes, and features to practice their listening and speaking skills.
Beyond its core platform, Lingopie developed specialized learning environments to cater to different learning preferences and needs. In 2025, the company launched Short Stories by Lingopie, an interactive reading feature that combines bite-sized narratives with language learning tools.  


=== Lingopie Kids ===
Launched as a child-focused extension of the main platform, Lingopie Kids provides age-appropriate content while maintaining the core interactive learning tools. The platform features curated content specifically selected for young language learners, including animated series, educational programs, and children's entertainment content.
As of early 2025, Lingopie Kids can be used to learn Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese. Lingopie Kids is also available for Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese speakers learning English.


=== Lingopie Music ===
As a complementary service, Lingopie Music applies the platform's interactive learning methodology to music-based content. The service integrates synchronized lyrics with music videos, allowing learners to interact with song lyrics while maintaining the platform’s immersive dual-subtitle functionality.
As of early 2025, Lingopie Music supports English speakers learning Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, and Korean.


=== Lingopie Lessons ===
Lingopie offers live language instruction, including private one-on-one and group lessons taught by native-speaking tutors. The platform utilizes an integrated scheduling system to provide live Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Japanese lessons.

Lingopie Private Lessons are designed to accommodate various proficiency levels and individual learning objectives.
Lingopie Group Lessons are organized around thematic structures. Each session focuses on specific topics and includes accompanying lesson materials.


=== Lingopie TV App ===
Developed for smart television platforms, the TV application extends Lingopie’s learning environment to television devices. As of 2024, the platform hosts approximately 3,000 hours of multilingual content, including feature films, television series, podcast content, and music videos. The Lingopie TV app maintains the platform’s interactive learning features while adapting them for television interface requirements.
