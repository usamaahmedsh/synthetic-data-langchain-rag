The Nokia 3-digit series are a series of feature and  smartphones by HMD Global and previously by Microsoft Mobile and Nokia, generally aimed at developing markets.


== History ==


=== Under Nokia ===
Nokia originally launched the brand for low end devices aimed at developing markets but among the series' original operating systems was the primarily smartphone-aimed operating system, Symbian which was discontinued in October 2011. And after the depreciation of Symbian Nokia started to exclusively use S30 and S40 as their feature phone platforms.


=== Under Microsoft ===
Microsoft completed its acquisition of Nokia's devices and services divisions in 2014 after which they continued developing and selling Nokia's feature phone range but decided to discontinue S30 and S40 in favour of S30+. With the release of newer devices Microsoft started to add their services such as Bing, MSN Weather, and GroupMe to the operating system. In June 2016, Microsoft sold the series as part of its feature phone sale to HMD Global.


=== Under HMD Global ===
HMD Global completed the acquisition from Microsoft and started manufacturing Nokia-branded phones in late 2016. Since 2019, most devices made by HMD run new Series 30+ based on UNISOC's Mocor OS platform, such as Nokia 220 4G. Also, Nokia 800 Tough was the only Nokia 3-digit series phone run KaiOS.
