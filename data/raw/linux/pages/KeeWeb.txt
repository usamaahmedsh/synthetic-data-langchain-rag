KeeWeb is a free and open-source password manager compatible with KeePass, available as a web version and desktop apps. The underlying file format is KDBX (KeePass database file).


== Technology ==
KeeWeb is written in JavaScript and uses WebCrypto and WebAssembly to process password files in the browser, without uploading them to a server. It can synchronize files with popular file hosting services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive.
KeeWeb is also available as an Electron bundle which resembles a desktop app. The desktop version adds some features not available on web:

auto-typing passwords
ability to open and save local files
sync to WebDAV without CORS enabled
KeeWeb can also be deployed as a standalone server, or installed as a Nextcloud app.


== Reception ==
KeeWeb was praised by Ghacks Technology News in 2016 as "brand-new" fixing the "shortcoming of a web-based version" of KeePass, and by Tech Advisor in 2020 as "well-designed cross-platform password manager".
