The ODROID is a series of single-board computers and tablet computers created by Hardkernel Co., Ltd., located in South Korea. Even though the name ODROID is a portmanteau of open + Android, the hardware is not actually open source because some parts of the design are retained by the company. Many ODROID systems are capable of running not only Android, but also regular Linux distributions.


== Hardware ==
Several models of ODROID's have been released by Hardkernel. The first generation was released in 2009, followed by higher specification models.
C models feature an Amlogic system on a chip (SoC), while XU models feature a Samsung Exynos SoC. Both include an ARM central processing unit (CPU) and an on chip graphics processing unit (GPU). CPU architectures include ARMv7-A and ARMv8-A, on board memory range from 1 GB RAM to 4 GiB RAM. Secure Digital SD cards are used to store the operating system and program memory in either the SDHC or MicroSDHC sizes. Most boards have between three and five mixed USB 2.0 or 3.0 slots, HDMI output, and a 3.5 mm jack. Lower level output is provided by a number of general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins which support common protocols like I²C. Current models have an Gigabit Ethernet (8P8C) port and eMMC module socket.
