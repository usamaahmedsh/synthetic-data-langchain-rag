Armbian is a software framework for building system images for single-board computers (SBCs). It is not a Linux distribution in its own right but builds upon Debian or Ubuntu, providing a minimal base system optimized for SBC hardware and maintaining its own kernels. The framework allows users and manufacturers to deploy ready-made images or create customized ones for specific hardware.


== Supported hardware ==
The Armbian project supports more than 200 single-board computers as of August 2025, including some with limited third-party support. Support is categorized as platinum, standard, community maintained, or staging. Platinum is reserved for boards whose maintenance is funded directly by a business partner. Standard refers to boards with active maintenance, which may be provided voluntarily or through financial support from users or companies. Community maintained covers images without active supervision or development, while staging refers to boards with an assigned maintainer that are not yet ready for stable releases.
