BlizzCon is an annual gaming convention held by Blizzard Entertainment to promote its major franchises including Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, and Overwatch.
The first BlizzCon was held in October 2005, and since then, all of the conventions have been held at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, near Blizzard's headquarters in Irvine. The convention features game-related announcements, previews of upcoming Blizzard Entertainment games and content, Q&A sessions and panels, costume contests, and playable versions of various Blizzard games. The Closing Ceremony has featured concerts by The Offspring, Tenacious D, Foo Fighters, Ozzy Osbourne, Blink-182, Metallica, Linkin Park, "Weird Al" Yankovic, and Muse. Blizzard also hosted a similar event outside the U.S. from 2004 to 2008, known as the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational.


== Tickets and pricing ==


=== General admission (since 2005) ===
General admission tickets are considered to be the baseline experience for BlizzCon. It grants access to attend all panels across both days; play new games, patches, and expansions; and order exclusive Blizzard merchandise online before the convention. Since its inception in 2005, the prices have changed drastically as its scope and attendees have grown.

For BlizzCon 2005, tickets were set at US$120.
For BlizzCon 2007 & 2008, the price was decreased by $20 to US$100.
For BlizzCon 2009, the price was increased by $25 to $125.
For BlizzCon 2010, the price was increased by another $25 to $150.
For BlizzCon 2011 & 2013, the price was increased by another $25 to $175.
For BlizzCon 2014–2018, the price was increased by another $24 to $199.
For BlizzCon 2019, the price was increased by $30 to $229.
For BlizzCon 2023, the price was increased by $70 to $299.
Each general admission ticket includes a goody bag with items like beta keys for upcoming Blizzard games, exclusive Blizzard paraphernalia, and in-game prizes. The in-game prizes have ranged from pets, transmog, mounts in World of Warcraft & Heroes of the Storm; exclusive card packs for Hearthstone; heroes for Heroes of the Storm; cosmetic wings & pets for Diablo III; skins for Overwatch; and portraits, unit skins, and console skins for Starcraft: Remastered and Starcraft II.


=== Benefit Dinner (2009–2019) ===
Starting with BlizzCon 2009, the BlizzCon Benefit Dinner, sometimes called the VIPs Dinner, was introduced as an additional ticket option. The dinner donates all net proceeds to the Children's Hospital of Orange County. Guests can meet with game developers, artists, executives, and other Blizzard Entertainment employees.
The tickets included the dinner, signed print of Blizzard artwork, and BlizzCon ticket. In later BlizzCons, reserved seating for the Opening Ceremony and Community Night on the first day of the show were added as additional benefits. These tickets usually had their own sale date separate from the main ticket. The price for these tickets were:

$500 for BlizzCon 2009, 2010, 2011 & 2013
$750 for BlizzCon 2014–2019


=== Portal Pass (since 2019) ===
Beginning with BlizzCon 2019, the Portal Pass was added as an additional ticket option for $550; it effectively replaced the Benefit Dinner option for BlizzCon 2023. It is considered an upgrade over the General Admission ticket. This price was increased by $229 to $799 with BlizzCon 2023. It granted additional access to:

"Night at the Faire" event in the Darkmoon Faire area the night before BlizzCon starts (BlizzCon 2019 Only)
Access to the convention halls before general admission (BlizzCon 2019 Only)
Private viewing lounge with video feeds of the panels

== Event cancellations ==
BlizzCon is typically held every year. However, it has been cancelled six times in 2006, 2012, 2020, 2022, 2024, and 2025.

The first cancellation came in 2006 with no reason given at the time.
Cancelled again in 2012, a Blizzard community manager claimed that Blizzard was working on "releasing multiple titles that year and so felt they may not have anything big, new or cool to talk about". World of Warcraft's fourth expansion, Mists of Pandaria, and Diablo III both launched in 2012 while StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm launched in March 2013.
The event was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A virtual event called BlizzConline was held in February 2021, in lieu of an in-person event.
BlizzCon 2022 was to be held in a modified format with virtual programming and "smaller, in-person gatherings". It was again cancelled in October 2021 in order to prioritize "supporting our teams and progressing development of our games and experiences", and to provide time to "reinvent" the event to be "safe, welcoming, and inclusive as possible". This cancellation came amid the California state government's employee discrimination lawsuit against parent company Activision Blizzard.
BlizzCon 2024 was cancelled in April 2024, with no reason given.
BlizzCon 2025 was similarly cancelled in March 2025 with no explicit reason, but in the announcement, Blizzard stated its 2026 BlizzCon plans.

=== 2020s ===


==== 2020 ====
In April 2020, Blizzard announced that they were still working on plans for the next BlizzCon, noting that it may occur in some other form or be cancelled entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, Blizzard confirmed they will not hold the physical event, but was considering some online replacement which would not likely occur until early 2021.


==== 2021 ====
On September 21, 2020, Blizzard announced that the virtual event BlizzConline would be held from February 19–20, 2021. It featured the unveiling of Diablo II: Resurrected and the remastered version of The Burning Crusade expansion for World of Warcraft Classic, as well as further details on Overwatch 2 and Diablo Immortal.
In May 2021, Blizzard announced that the in-person BlizzCon event was again cancelled due to COVID-19, as the "ongoing complexities and uncertainties of the pandemic" made it impossible to organize an event at the required scale for its traditional November scheduling. Blizzard stated that there were plans for a "global event" with online components and "smaller in-person gatherings" to be held in early 2022.


==== 2022 ====
On October 26, 2021, amid, but without mentioning, ongoing litigation against the company over its workplace culture and treatment of female employees, Blizzard announced that the previously announced "global event" had been "paused", and that it would "take the time to reimagine what a BlizzCon event of the future could look like."

Additionally, Blizzard included a Mature warning for BlizzCon content that would not permit children under the age of 7 and required an adult for those aged 7–17 to enter. Blizzard further announced that BlizzCon 2023 would be live streamed for free. However, the Virtual Ticket was still sold by offering in-game items for various Blizzard games. Seating for the opening ceremony was assigned with a lottery due to the smaller capacity of the BlizzCon Arena. In addition, all panels and Community Night events were held BlizzCon Arena using first-come, first-served seating. Events in the BlizzCon Arena were simulcast to screens across BlizzCon.
