The Neo Geo is a video game platform developed and designed by SNK and supported from 1990 to 2004. It was released in three different iterations: a ROM cartridge-based arcade system board called the Multi Video System (MVS), a cartridge-based home video game console called the Advanced Entertainment System (AES), and a CD-ROM-based home console called the Neo Geo CD. Each system features similar hardware and runs the same library of games through different media formats. Most games were first released on the MVS, then rereleased for the home consoles. However, some never saw a home console release, and a few were released exclusively for the Neo Geo CD. This page lists every officially licensed game released for all three formats.
