TeamSupport is an American software company that provides a cloud-based customer-support platform built specifically for business-to-business (B2B) SaaS companies. The platform is designed to help teams manage long-term customer relationships by enabling better collaboration between support, success, product, and development teams.
Founded in 2008, TeamSupport offers tools for ticketing, live chat, customer self-service, success management, analytics, and artificial intelligence. It is best known for introducing the Customer Distress Index® (CDI), a proprietary scoring model that helps companies proactively identify at-risk customer accounts.


== History ==
TeamSupport was founded in Dallas, Texas, in 2008 by Robert C. Johnson, Eric Harrington, and Kevin Jones, software industry veterans who saw a need for support software tailored to the unique dynamics of B2B environments. In 2018, the company secured a growth investment from Level Equity, a New York-based private equity firm, to accelerate its product development and market expansion.
In August 2020, TeamSupport appointed Pete Khanna, former CEO of Trackvia, as its new chief executive officer, succeeding co-founder Johnson.  In May 2021, the company acquired SnapEngage, a live chat software firm, to expand its support offering with native chat and real-time messaging capabilities.
In 2024, Grant Stanis became CEO and led the launch of AI Assist, a generative-AI feature that supports ticket summarization, response drafting, and customer insight generation.

== Reception ==
In a December 2020 review, PCMag praised TeamSupport’s “strong collaboration tools” and robust ticket tracking, while noting that the interface was less modern than some newer platforms. More recent reviews note that TeamSupport stands out for its focus on B2B customer support and is particularly well-suited for medium to large B2B organizations, as it facilitates better team collaboration on support tickets, has more advanced reporting capabilities, and provides a more comprehensive customer database for in-depth insights.
