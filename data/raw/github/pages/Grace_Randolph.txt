=== Film ===
In 2019, Randolph appeared in a post-credits scene in the film Zombieland: Double Tap in a cameo as an entertainment reporter alongside actor Bill Murray, who played a fictionalized version of himself.


== Controversies ==


=== James Gunn ===
Grace Randolph is known to have a contentious relationship with film director James Gunn. In November 2012, Randolph advocated that Marvel Studios fire Gunn for offensive comments he made in 2009. In 2017, Randolph claimed that Gunn did not give Thanos a large role in his Guardians of the Galaxy films because he did not find the character interesting. Gunn denied her claim and later stated that Randolph "likes to just make up stuff I've said because it helps her get clicks." After Randolph claimed that the character Bane would appear in Gunn's Peacemaker series, Gunn said that the character "does not show up at the end or anywhere and has zero lines." After Randolph reported that audience reactions to Peacemaker were "less than stellar"; Gunn responded that "Grace Randolph will spout bullshit."


=== Birds of Prey reshoots ===
In June 2020, Randolph reported that the film Birds of Prey underwent "massive reshoots" to take out an alleged dick pic storyline that contained elements of pedophilia. Director Cathy Yan vehemently denied the allegation while downplaying the severity of the reshoots, criticizing Randolph for her lack of research. Randolph defended her report, leading to an exchange between the two on Twitter with Yan questioning Randolph's credibility as a journalist.


=== Pedro Pascal and The Mandalorian ===
In September 2020, Randolph claimed in a reaction video on Beyond the Trailer that The Mandalorian star Pedro Pascal had quit halfway through filming the second season over being denied more screen time without the title character's helmet on. Randolph further alleged that Pascal's behavior led to Lucasfilm killing his character off and replacing him with Boba Fett (played by Temuera Morrison) for the third season. When Pascal was asked about these reports in an interview with The One Show, he categorically denied Randolph's claims, while Pascal's stunt double confirmed Pascal's involvement with the entire third season in an Instagram post. Randolph refused to retract her story, arguing that the post-credits scene from The Mandalorian's second season finale, which foreshadowed The Book of Boba Fett, corroborated her claims. Jon Favreau, the showrunner of The Mandalorian, later clarified that The Book of Boba Fett was separate from the third season of The Mandalorian. Randolph's handling of the Pascal story was criticized by journalists, who described her report as clickbait and singled out her lack of reliable sources; they also asserted that her claims of Pascal being uncooperative on set could have potentially damaged his reputation and career.
