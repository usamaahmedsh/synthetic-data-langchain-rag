Keyboard shortcuts for main functions
Ability to download podcasts
Automatic marking of items as read as they are scrolled past
Search in all feeds, across all updates from subscriptions
Current subscription lists and read/unread state of items in the application can be synchronized via a FTP or WebDAV server, allowing use from multiple computers
Feeds can be read from a Google Reader account, allowing the user to subscribe or unsubscribe from feeds, mark items as read or star them in RSS Bandit and have these changes reflected in Google Reader
Feeds can be read from Facebook accounts, to read their news feed and comment on the status updates of their friends.
