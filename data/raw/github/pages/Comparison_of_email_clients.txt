=== General features ===
For all of these clients, the concept of "HTML support" does not mean that they can process the full range of HTML that a web browser can handle. Almost all email readers limit HTML features, either for security reasons, or because of the nature of the interface. CSS and JavaScript can be especially problematic.


=== Messages features ===


=== Database, folders and customization ===


=== Templates, scripts and programming languages ===


== Internationalization ==

The Bat! supports Email Address Internationalization (EAI).
As of October 2016, email clients supporting SMTPUTF8 included Outlook 2016, mail for iOS, and mail for Android.
