== Company ==
Intaver Institute Inc. was founded in 2002. Intaver Institute develops quantitative and qualitative risk analysis and risk management software. Particularly Intaver Institute develops software for schedule and cost risk analysis using Event chain methodology. Intaver Institute also performs project management and risk management consulting and training. Intaver Institute published papers and books on project risk management and decision analysis with particular focus on application of psychology of judgement and decision making in project management.


== History ==
In 2004, Intaver launched RiskyProject 1.0 which featured project scheduling, Monte Carlo simulations of project schedules, multiple statistical distributions for task cost and durations, discrete risk event modelling, reporting, and integration with 3rd party project scheduling software. In 2005 Intaver Institute's reseller program launched its reseller program. In 2006 Intaver Institute started academic program, where RiskyProject software was offered with discounts for educational use.
In 2007, Intaver released RiskyProject 2 that included probabilistic and conditional branching, task success rate and crucial tasks analysis, reporting,
risk templates, probabilistic calendars, and probabilistic cost analysis charts. In 2009, Intaver released RiskyProject 3 that included an integrated risk register Risk register included risk customizable risk properties, risk categories. RiskyProject 3 also included integration with Microsoft Project using RiskyProject toolbars in Microsoft Project.
In 2010, Intaver release Risky Project 4 that included risk response and mitigation planning. Risk analysis of project cost was significantly improved. This release also included a management of non-schedule risks, such as safety, security, quality, etc. The release included a Microsoft Project 2010 Add-in that allows user to perform Monte Carlo simulations on cost and schedule inside Microsoft Project. In 2012, Intaver released RiskyProject 5 that included upgraded risk management features: history of risk changes, and risk reviews. Probability-Impact risk matrix included risk tolerance customization features and information about risk mitigation. In October 2014, Intaver released version 6 that included a new project portfolio risk management client/server application RiskyProject Enterprise to the existing RiskyProject Professional and Lite.
