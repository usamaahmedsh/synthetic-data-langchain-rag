TaskCracker for Outlook is a Microsoft Outlook add-in for task- and time-management. It allows managing tasks visually within Microsoft Outlook interface. It is based on the Eisenhower Method of arranging tasks by urgency and importance. It is also loosely based on David Allen's Getting Things Done methodology of improving productivity.
As per posts on the TaskCracker Facebook community page as early as March 2019, the software does not appear to be actively developed any longer.
