== History ==
In 2006, the purchase of the domain name for $500,000 by German entrepreneurs Julius and David Dreyer was a record sale for the year and one of the highlights of the domain name industry. The website launched as a closed beta in Shanghai on 17 May 2008, and was timed to coincide with the fourth International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. Gays.com became open beta on 10 September 2008.
