== History ==
Logistaas was founded in 2015 and is based in Amman, Jordan. The company started by building a cloud-based platform to help freight forwarders manage shipments, pricing, and documentation in one system. It was developed to meet the needs of logistics companies looking for easier ways to handle everyday tasks without relying on spreadsheets or disconnected tools.
In 2025, Logistaas added integrations with third-party freight platforms. A connection with Cargofive enabled users to access and compare ocean freight rates from over 25 carriers directly in the system. Another integration with WebCargo by Freightos provided access to multi-carrier rates and supported digital booking through API connectivity.
In 2025, Logistaas was ranked 16th in Deloitte's Middle East Technology Fast 50 list, a recognition based on revenue growth among technology companies in the region.
