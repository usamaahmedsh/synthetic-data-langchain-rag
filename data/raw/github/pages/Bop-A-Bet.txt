== Reception ==
Bob Proctor reviewed four educational games for Computer Gaming World, and stated that "In terms of simplicity, three of these four games can be used by the age groups for which they were intended. Bop-A-Bet would also qualify except for those questions at the start which set up the game. However, you also have to ask yourself if your children (or students) can be entrusted with the only copy of a $30 to $40 disk."
