Videoloft is a privately held British technology company that provides cloud-based video-surveillance-as-a-service (VSaaS). It is headquartered on Milton Park in Oxfordshire.


== History ==
Videoloft was incorporated on 27 June 2012 as Manything by James West and Mike Fischer. Its first product, released under the name Manything ("monitor anything"), was a mobile app that repurposed old smartphones as DIY security cameras.
Pivoting from consumer DIY to the professional channel, Manything partnered with camera maker Hikvision in 2017 and began selling cloud recording to security dealers. In August 2019, Manything was renamed as Videoloft, while keeping the Manything app for its legacy users.
From 2020 onward, Videoloft publicised a series of product milestones: the launch of cloud-based video analytics with object and text recognition capabilities, native 4K cloud recording, direct integrations with manufacturers such as Vivotek, and larger 16- and 64-channel Cloud Adapter models for enterprise sites. A 2021 feature in International Security Journal highlighted the company's push into the United States, describing multi-state deployments and a growing reseller base. In a later report, Videoloft announced it was expanding its presence in the United States through new U.S.-based sales staff and integrations with brands including Digital Watchdog, exacqVision, Vivotek and Lorex.
In 2024, Security Journal published an article by Videoloft’s VP of Marketing, Diana Lord, discussing the growth and implications of cloud-based CCTV systems and highlighting the increasing industry shift from local storage solutions to cloud video management platforms.


== Operations ==
Videoloft operates on a software-as-a-service model. It maintains its research-and-development and administrative headquarters in Abingdon, with sales staff in North America and channel distributors across Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.


== Services ==
Videoloft's core offering is a cloud video management system that records up to 8-megapixel (4 K) video directly to the cloud or in hybrid mode alongside local NVRs. Features reported by International Security Journal include AI-based object detection, people-counting dashboards and licence-plate recognition add-ons. In 2020, Videoloft opened a free beta of its cloud analytics suite, adding text and object recognition without requiring analytics-enabled cameras. In 2021, Security Info Watch reported that Videoloft’s cloud platform was being adopted across industries including retail, education, construction, and cannabis compliance, providing both primary recording and secure offsite backup solutions.
The Cloud Adapter range, 8-, 16- and 64-channel gateways, was launched between 2019 and 2022 to accommodate larger multi-site roll-outs. Benchmark magazine described the units as "no-latency local display bridges" that allow operators to view live streams on on-site monitors while keeping all recording off-premises.
