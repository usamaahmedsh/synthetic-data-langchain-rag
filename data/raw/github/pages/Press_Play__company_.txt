Press Play ApS was a Danish video game development studio based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Over the course of its 10-year lifespan from 2006 to 2016, Press Play released five titles, including Max & the Magic Marker, Max: The Curse of Brotherhood, and Kalimba.
In 2012, the studio was acquired by Microsoft, and Press Play was then part of the Microsoft Studios family along with other studios like 343 Industries, Rare, Lionhead Studios, Turn 10 Studios, and Twisted Pixel Games. On 7 March 2016 Microsoft announced their plan to close Press Play, and their title, Knoxville, was cancelled. Three days later, Press Play was officially closed by Microsoft Studios. After closure, Press Play founded a new studio called Flashbulb Games, who developed and published Trailmakers.
On 10 November 2016 Flashbulb acquired Press Play and its library of games to republish under the Flashbulb name, including Kalimba, Tentacles: Enter the Mind, and Max: The Curse of Brotherhood.
