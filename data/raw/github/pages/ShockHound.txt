== Content ==
ShockHound had an online social networking platform which allowed users to create and share content. Additional website content included music reviews, rock concerts, interviews, music videos, streaming audio, and original programming called Shock Shows, including Taco Tuesday and Stella Can't Cook. ShockHound opened its first retail store in Torrance, California in the Del Amo Fashion Center.

In addition to music downloads, music-related merchandise was also available on the website, including band T-shirts, accessories, posters, concert tickets, and Vinyl records. This type of cross merchandising was unique in the digital audio market. ShockHound utilized a proprietary shopping cart functionality which combined music downloads and merchandise purchases into a single transaction.

As part of their opening launch in 2008, ShockHound offered free concerts by No Age,  Titus Andronicus and Snow Patrol, to users in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and San Diego.
