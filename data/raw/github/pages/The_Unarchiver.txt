The Unarchiver is a free data decompression utility, which supports more formats than Archive Utility (formerly known as BOMArchiveHelper), the built-in archive unpacker program in macOS. It can also handle filenames in various character encodings, created using operating system versions that use those character encodings. The Unarchiver does not compress files.
A key feature of The Unarchiver is its ability to handle many old or obscure Mac OS Classic and Amiga archive formats, including StuffIt, Compact Pro, AmigaOS disk images, and LZH/LZX archives. The source code credits libxad, an Amiga file format library. Utility author Dag Ågren reverse engineered the StuffIt and StuffIt X formats. His work resulted in one of the most complete open source implementations of these proprietary formats.
