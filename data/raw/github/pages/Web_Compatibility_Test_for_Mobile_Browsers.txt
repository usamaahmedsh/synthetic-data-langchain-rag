Web Compatibility Test for Mobile Browsers, often called the Mobile Acid test, despite not being a true Acid test, is a test page published and promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to expose web page rendering flaws in mobile web browsers and other applications that render HTML. It was developed in the spirit of the Acid test by the Web Standards Project to test the relevant parts that a mobile browser needs to support. The browser has to accomplish 16 different subtests indicated by a 4 x 4 image of green or red squares.


== Web Compatibility Test for Mobile Browsers  – Version 2 ==
A second version of the Web Compatibility Test for Mobile Browsers was released in January 2010, this time testing HTML5 elements. The second test does not have an official explanation page, only a direct link to the test is available.


== Overview of standards tested ==
The mobile Acid test tests a variety of web standards published by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Internet Engineering Task Force.
Specifically, the mobile Acid test tests:

CSS2 min-width
Transparent PNG
gzip support
HTTPS
Cookies support
iframe including of XHTML-served-as-XML content
XMLHttpRequest
Static SVG (gzipped)
CSS Media Queries
JavaScript framework
Dynamic SVG
IRIs and IDN
DOM 'mutation' events

The second version of the test tests the following elements:

XmlHttpRequest
<canvas>
contenteditable
Geolocation
<input type='date'>
Appcache
<video>
<audio>
Web Workers
localStorage
sessionStorage
@font-face


== Passing Conditions ==
A green square indicates that the browser fully supports its assigned feature. A square colored red or a different color indicates that the feature is not fully supported. The second test shows a percentage bar indicating the percent of elements supported.


== Results ==
Due to the wide variety of web engines used at the time for mobile browsers, results varied between browsers used. Safari on iOS 3 received a 15/16 score on the first test and the Palm Pre web browser scored a 13/16 in revision 1.47 of the first test. In 2010, Firefox Mobile for Android scored a 75% while Safari scored a 67%. By 2012, versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox had scores of 80% or over on the second test. The most common failure on the second test was <input type='date'>, with a 61.45% failure rate.
