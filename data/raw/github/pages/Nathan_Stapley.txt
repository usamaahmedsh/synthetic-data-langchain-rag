== Career ==
Nathan Stapley started his career at LucasArts, where he worked as an artist on Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine and Star Wars Episode I: Racer.  He left LucasArts to work as an artist at LucasArts alumnus Tim Schafer's studio, Double Fine Productions.
While at Double Fine, Stapley created a comic called My Comic About Me, which led to the development of a free Flash sports game parody called My Game About Me: Olympic Challenge. This game was developed by Klint Honeychurch with art by Stapley.
He was working on Broken Age as the lead artist and has also been an artist on Psychonauts and Psychonauts 2. A poster he created was included as one of the reward tiers in the Broken Age Kickstarter campaign.


== Recognition ==
My Game About Me: Olympic Challenge received more attention than the average free online flash game.
The Broken Age (working title Double Fine Adventure) Kickstarter campaign became the most successful project on the platform at the time, attracting more record backers than any prior effort in the site's history.
