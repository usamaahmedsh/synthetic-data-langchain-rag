Scary Mommy was founded in March 2008 by Jill Smokler in Baltimore, Maryland. A companion book titled Confessions of a Scary Mommy was published by Smokler in April 2012 and became an instant bestseller. Scary Mommy Nation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, was established by Smokler in 2013, which raised money for families who weren't able to afford a Thanksgiving dinner. In 2014, the website and its service earned its first Webby Award in the "Family/Parenting" category, which was then followed by additional Webby Awards in 2015 and 2018.
In February 2015, the website was acquired by Some Spiders Studios, with Smokler staying on as chief content officer for the next three years. Smokler left Scary Mommy in May 2018. In 2020, Some Spider Studios acquired Fatherly, and in 2021, Bustle Digital Group acquired Some Spider.
