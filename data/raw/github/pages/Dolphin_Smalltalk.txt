Dolphin Smalltalk, or "Dolphin" for short, is an implementation of the programming language Smalltalk for Microsoft Windows.
The Dolphin 7 version release coincided with the project becoming free and open-source software under an MIT License.
Dolphin uses an integrated development environment. The toolset of this Smalltalk dialect include an integrated refactoring browser, a package browser and a WYSIWYG "view composer". Dolphin deviates from the conventional Smalltalk framework of model–view–controller (MVC), instead using model–view–presenter (MVP).


== Features ==
Integration of the Refactoring Browser tools from Refactory Inc.
Package-based browsing environment as an alternative to a conventional Smalltalk class hierarchy browser.
A tabbed container to manage Dolphin browsers and tools and associating them together with a given idea or workflow. The goal is to save screen space and clutter and to help developers focus on their train of thought.
Source code management very similar to the ENVY source code manager that was available for some other commercial Smalltalk dialects.
