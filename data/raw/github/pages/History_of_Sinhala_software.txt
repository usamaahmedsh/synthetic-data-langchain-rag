Sinhala language software for computers have been present since the late 1980s (Samanala written in C) but no standard character representation system was put in place which resulted in proprietary character representation systems and fonts. In the wake of this CINTEC (Computer and Information Technology Council of Sri Lanka) introduced Sinhala within the UNICODE (16‑bit character technology) standard. ICTA concluded the work started by CINTEC for approving and standardizing Sinhala Unicode in Sri Lanka.

1985

CINTEC establishes a committee for the use of Sinhala & Tamil in Computer Technology.
1987

"DOS WordPerfect" Reverend Gangodawila Soma Thero, who was the chief incumbent at the Springvale Buddhist temple in Melbourne, Australia asked the Lay members of the temple to produce a Monthly Newsletter for the temple in Sinhala, called "Bodu Puwath". A lay person named Jayantha de Silva developed two HP PCL Sinhala fonts called Lihil and an intelligent Phonetic keyboard that was able to select letters based on context, together with a printer driver and screen fonts. All this was possible because the utilities to create the keyboard and printer driver were supplied with WordPerfect. It was easy to use and was installed in many PCs owned by lay members and in the temple PC for typing articles. The program fell into disuse after Windows came online in 1990 as it did not support the WordPerfect macro keyboard.
1988/1989

== Machine Translation ==
In 2006, Rohan Manamudali and Sampath Godamunne, the original developers of the Thibus software suite, launched Sri Lanka’s first Sinhala–Tamil language translation initiative.

The system, known as the Thibus Translator, was developed to automatically convert textual content between Sinhala and Tamil—two constitutionally recognized national languages in Sri Lanka.
The initiative aimed to improve communication and accessibility across communities, and was one of the earliest efforts in rule-based machine translation for Sri Lankan languages. Though limited in scope compared to later AI-driven tools, it demonstrated the feasibility of interlanguage translation using structured lexicons, grammar parsing, and word substitution techniques.
This project followed the team’s previous achievements, including the Thibus Trilingual Word Processor (1989) and the Thibus Dictionary (2000), marking another significant step in local language computing and NLP (Natural Language Processing) development in Sri Lanka.

The servers and software for the site was provided free of charge by UCSC. ICTA developed 3 more websites in 2007 in order to extend the support provided by www.fonts.lk in local languages. While www.emadumilihal.lk provides information and software for using Tamil Unicode, http://www.locallanguages.lk provides information and software for using both Sinhala and Tamil Unicode.
