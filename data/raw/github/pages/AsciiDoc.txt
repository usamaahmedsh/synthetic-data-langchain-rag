AsciiDoc is a human-readable document format, semantically equivalent to DocBook XML, but using plain text mark-up conventions. AsciiDoc documents can be created using any text editor and read “as-is”, or rendered to HTML or any other format supported by a DocBook tool-chain, i.e., PDF, TeX, Unix manpages, e-books, slide presentations, etc. Common file extensions for AsciiDoc files are adoc and historically txt (as encouraged by AsciiDoc's creator).
The AsciiDoc format is being standardized by the Eclipse Foundation.


== History ==


=== Early history ===
 
AsciiDoc was created in 2002 by Stuart Rackham, who published tools (asciidoc and a2x), written in the programming language Python to convert plain text, human readable files to commonly used published document formats.
Implementations also exist in Ruby (named Asciidoctor, released in 2013), the Java ecosystem via JRuby, the JavaScript ecosystem via Opal.js, and in Haskell and Go.


=== Standardizing and primacy of Asciidoctor (2019–present) ===
Since the start of the technical standardizing process in 2019, the Asciidoctor project has aimed to produce an independent, compatible implementation of the AsciiDoc specification in the making, with the support of Stuart Rackham, the original author of the language. The official website of the AsciiDoc language has since begun linking to Asciidoctor's documentation of the language.
The start of the standardizing process in 2019 coincided with the release of Asciidoctor 2.0 and several parts of syntax being deprecated, such as single quotation marks (') to indicate italics. Legacy syntax remains available through a compatibility mode.
The original Python implementation by Stuart Rackham continues to be developed, and named AsciiDoc.py. Since 2021, its documentation describes it as legacy, and formally targets the older rendition of the language.


== Notable applications ==

Most of the Git project documentation is written in AsciiDoc.
Some of O'Reilly Media's books and e-books are authored using AsciiDoc mark-up.
Red Hat's product documentation is written in AsciiDoc.
Asciidoctor is usable within GitHub and GitLab.


== Example ==
The following shows text using AsciiDoc mark-up, and a rendering similar to that produced by an AsciiDoc processor:


== Tools ==
Antora – multi-repository documentation site generator for tech writers using git
AsciiBinder – (deprecated) documentation system built on Asciidoctor for people who have many docs to maintain and republish regularly
awestruct – static site generator inspired by Jekyll
Asciidoc FX – AsciiDoc Book Editor based on JavaFX 18
AsciiDocLIVE – free online AsciiDoc editor
DAPS – DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (DAPS) is command-line software to publish DocBook & AsciiDoc as HTML, PDF, and EPUB
