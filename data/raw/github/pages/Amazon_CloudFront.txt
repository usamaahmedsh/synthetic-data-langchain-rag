Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) operated by Amazon Web Services. The content delivery network was created to provide a globally-distributed network of proxy servers to cache content, such as web videos or other bulky media, more locally to consumers, to improve access speed for downloading the content.
CloudFront has servers located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Australia, South America, Africa, and several major cities in the United States. In May 2025, the service operated from 1600+ edge locations on every continent excluding Antarctica.
CloudFront operates on a pay-as-you-go basis.
CloudFront competes with larger CDNs, such as Akamai, Azion, Cloudflare, and Edgio (previously known as Limelight Networks). Upon launch, Larry Dignan of ZDNet News stated that CloudFront could cause price and margin reductions for competing CDNs.
