The INQ1 is the first product of the Hutchinson Whampoa subsidiary, INQ. The INQ1 was released in December 2008 as a social-networking phone. Retailing at a cheaper price than competitors such as the iPhone, Blackberry Storm, G1 and Nokia 5800, it also contains slightly fewer features than other 3G 'smartphones'. It is thus marketed as an entry-level phone for users wanting to access websites and web-base applications from their mobile. The phone was created for the 3 phone network.
The INQ1 integrates a range of services such as Skype, Last.fm, eBay, Facebook, Myspace and Windows Live Messenger. The inclusion of Facebook in a prominent position has led to its description as 'the Facebook phone'.


== Reaction ==
The phone received generally positive reviews upon release. Some were extremely positive, with its low price, easy integration of multiple social networking features and light weight all being quoted as positive features. In particular, the phone was seen as successful for a manufacturer's first handset. 
The phone was awarded 'best handset' at the 'Mobile World Congress' in February 2009
