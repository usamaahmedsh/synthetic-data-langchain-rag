The 3 Skypephone S2 is a UMTS, GSM and VoIP mobile phone. The phone is the successor to 3 Skypephone and the second phone from the 3 Skypephone Series.


== iSkoot ==
The 3 Skypephone S2 runs on the iSkoot for Skype platform to provide its Skype service. iSkoot's shutdown of this service on 20 January 2011 caused this phone to show a non-functioning "click to upgrade" link, although some other phones were not affected. No warning was given by Three for this shutdown, and visiting the Three website shows they removed the Skypephone from their product offerings. This violates Three's own terms and conditions and the "Free Skype forever" promise leaving customers very angry and unable to use the arguably main functionality of this phone.
