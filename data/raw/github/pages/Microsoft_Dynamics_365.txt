Microsoft Dynamics AX was one of Microsoft's Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software products. In 2018, its thick-client interface was removed and the web product was rebranded as Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations as a part of the Dynamics 365 suite. MDCC or Microsoft Development Center Copenhagen was once the primary development center for Dynamics AX. Microsoft Dynamics AX contained 19 core modules:

==== Presence on the internet ====
Information about Axapta prior to the Microsoft purchase was available on technet.navision.com, a proprietary web-based newsgroup, which grew to a considerable number of members and posts before the Microsoft purchase in 2002.
After Microsoft incorporated Axapta into their Business Solution suite, they transferred the newsgroup's content to the Microsoft Business Solutions newsgroup. The oldest Axapta Technet post that can be found dates to August 2000.


==== Events ====
Extreme Conferences: extreme365 is a conference for the Dynamics 365 Partner Community which now includes Dynamics AX, featuring an Executive Forum.


==== Personalization and predictive analytics ====
At the National Retail Federation (NRF) Conference 2016 in New York, Microsoft unveiled its partnership with Infinite Analytics, a Cambridge-based predictive analytics and personalization company.


== Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central ==
 
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (formerly Microsoft Dynamics NAV) – ERP and CRM software-as-a-service product meant for small and mid-sized businesses. Integrating both Dynamics NAV and Dynamics CRM features, consisting of the following modules: for Financials and Operations, for Sales Professionals, for Marketing. Easily connected with Office 365 and PowerBI.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (formerly Microsoft CRM). Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement contains modules to interact with customers: Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, Field Service. The Customer Service is a module used to automate customer service processes providing performance data reports and dashboards.


=== Online and on-premises deployment ===
The Dynamics 365 Business Central system comes in both an online hosted (SaaS) version and an on-premises version for manual deployment and administration.
Some features, such as integration with other online Microsoft services, are not available in the on-premises version and only in the online edition.


=== Localization ===
As an international ERP system, Business Central is available with 24 official localizations to work with the local features and requirements of various countries. Local partners provide an additional 47 localizations.
The system is compliant with various internal financial standards to meet local requirements, such as GDPR, IAS/IFRS and SOX.


=== Editions and licensing ===
There are two editions of Business Central, Essentials and Premium. Essentials covers Finance, Sales, Marketing, Purchasing, Inventory, Warehousing, and Project Management. Premium includes all of Essentials functionality plus Service Management and Manufacturing features.
With the arrival of NAV 2013, Microsoft introduced a new licensing model that operated on a concurrent user basis. With this model, user licenses were of two types: A full user or a limited user. The full user has access to the entire system, whereas the limited user only has read access to the system and limited write access. 
From the Business Central rebrand launch, the licensing model changed to a per-seat license model with a 3x concurrent seat multiplier added to any existing perpetual licenses from previous Dynamics NAV versions. Customers with a Dynamics NAV Extended Pack license were moved to the Premium edition.


=== Value-Added Resellers (VARs) ===
Business Central is primarily distributed and implemented through Microsoft’s global network of Value-Added Resellers (VARs) and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). VARs provide services such as consulting, implementation, customization, integration, training, and ongoing support. Because Business Central is highly extensible, VARs frequently tailor deployments to meet the specific requirements of industries such as manufacturing, distribution, retail, professional services, and field service.
ISVs supplement the core product by offering add-on applications and extensions through Microsoft AppSource. These extensions expand Business Central’s capabilities in areas such as reporting, payroll, manufacturing execution, commerce, document management, and integrations with third-party systems. Together, VARs and ISVs enable Business Central to support a wide range of industry and regional scenarios while maintaining a standardized cloud platform.


==== Examples of Value-Added Resellers (VARs) ====
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is supported by an international network of authorized partners. Examples of recognized VARs that provide implementation, customization, and support services include:

== Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales ==
 
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales is a customer relationship management software package developed by Microsoft. The current version is Dynamics 365. The name and licensing changed with the update from Dynamics 2016. 365 Sales comes with softphone capabilities.


== History ==
Microsoft Dynamics was a line of Business Applications, containing enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM). Microsoft marketed Dynamics applications through a network of reselling partners who provided specialized services. Microsoft Dynamics formed part of "Microsoft Business Solutions". Dynamics can be used with other Microsoft programs and services, such as SharePoint, Yammer, Office 365, Azure and Outlook. The Microsoft Dynamics focus-industries are retail, services, manufacturing, financial services, and the public sector. Microsoft Dynamics offers services for small, medium, and large businesses.


=== Business Central ===
Business Central was first published as Dynamics NAV and Navision, which Microsoft acquired in 2002.


==== Navision ====
Navision originated at PC&C A/S (Personal Computing and Consulting), a company founded in Denmark in 1984. PC&C released its first accounting package, PCPlus, in 1985—a single-user application with basic accounting functionality. There followed in 1987 the first version of Navision, a client/server-based accounting application that allowed multiple users to access the system simultaneously. The success of the product prompted the company to rename itself to Navision Software A/S in 1995.
The Navision product sold primarily in Denmark until 1990. From Navision version 3 the product was distributed in other European countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom.
In 1995 the first version of Navision based on Microsoft Windows 95 was released.
In 2000, Navision Software A/S merged with fellow Danish firm Damgaard A/S (founded 1983) to form NavisionDamgaard A/S. In 2001 the company changed its name to "Navision A/S".
On July 11, 2002, Microsoft bought Navision A/S to go with its previous acquisition of Great Plains Software. Navision became a new division at Microsoft, named Microsoft Business Solutions, which also handled Microsoft CRM.
In 2003 Microsoft announced plans to develop an entirely new ERP system (Project Green). But it later decided to continue development of all ERP systems (Dynamics AX, Dynamics NAV, Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL). Microsoft launched all four ERP systems with the same new role-based user interface, SQL-based reporting and analysis, SharePoint-based portal, Pocket PC-based mobile clients and integration with Microsoft Office.


==== Dynamics NAV ====
In September 2005, Microsoft re-branded the product and re-released it as Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
In December 2008, Microsoft released Dynamics NAV 2009, which contains both the original "classic" client, as well as a new .NET Framework-based three-tier GUI called the RoleTailored Client (RTC).
In first quarter of 2014 NAV reached 102,000 current customers.
In 2016, Microsoft announced the creation of Dynamics 365 — a rebranding of the suite of Dynamics ERP and CRM products as a part of a new online-only offering. As a part of this suite, the successor to NAV was codenamed "Madeira".


==== Dynamics 365 Business Central ====
In September 2017 at the Directions conference, Microsoft announced the new codename 
"Tenerife" as the next generation of the Dynamics NAV product. This replaced codename "Madeira".
On April 2, 2018, Business Central was released publicly and plans for semi-annual releases were announced.
Business Central introduced a new AL language for development and translated the codebase from Dynamics NAV (C/AL).


=== Dynamics SL, Dynamics GP, Dynamics C5 ===
Several variants of the Dynamics brand have migration paths to Business Central with most having not had a new release since 2018. The later releases of the SL, GP, and C5 products adopted the Dynamics NAV Role-Tailored Client UI which helped pave the transition to the Business Central product.


==== History of Dynamics C5 ====
Dynamics C5 was developed in Denmark as the successor to the DOS-based Concorde C4. The developing company Damgaard Data merged with Navision in 2001 which was subsequently acquired by Microsoft Microsoft in 2002 rebranding the solution from Navision C5 to Microsoft Dynamics C5.
The product handles currently more than 70,000 installations in Denmark.


==== History of Dynamics SL ====

Based in Findlay, Ohio, Solomon's roots go back more than 35 years, when co-founders Gary Harpst, Jack Ridge and Vernon Strong started TLB, Inc. in 1980. TLB, Inc. stands for The Lord's Business, "to remind the founders why the business was started: to conduct the business according to biblical principles." TLB was later renamed Solomon Software, and then Microsoft Dynamics SL.


==== History of Dynamics GP ====
The Dynamics GP product was originally developed by Great Plains Software, an independent company located in Fargo, North Dakota run by Doug Burgum. Dynamics Release 1.0 was released in February 1993. It was one of the first accounting packages in the United States that were designed and written to be multi-user and to run under Windows as 32-bit software. In late 2000, Microsoft announced the purchase of Great Plains Software. This acquisition was completed in April 2001.
Dynamics GP is written in a language called Dexterity. Previous versions were compatible with Microsoft SQL Server, Pervasive PSQL, Btrieve, and earlier versions also used C-tree, although after the buyout all new versions switched entirely to Microsoft SQL Server databases.
Dynamics GP will no longer be updated after September 2029, with security updates through April 2031.


=== Finance ===

=== Sales ===

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales has undergone several iterations over its history. 


==== Microsoft CRM 1.2 ====
Microsoft CRM 1.2 was released on December 8, 2003. Microsoft CRM 1.2 was not widely adopted by industry. 
It was not possible to create custom entities but there was a software development kit (SDK) available using SOAP and XML endpoints to interact with it.


==== Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 ====
The second version was rebranded as Microsoft Dynamics 3.0 (version 2.0 was skipped entirely) to signify its inclusion within the Dynamics product family and was released on December 5, 2005.
Notable updates over version 1.2 are the ease of creating customizations to CRM, the switch from using Crystal Reports to Microsoft SQL Reporting Services, and the ability to run on Windows Vista and Outlook 2007. 
Significant additions released later by Microsoft also allowed Dynamics CRM 3.0 to be accessed by various mobile devices and integration with Siebel Systems. This was the first version that saw reasonable take up by customers. 
You could create custom entities and (1xN) relations between the system/custom entities.


==== Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 ====
Dynamics CRM 4.0 (a.k.a. Titan) was introduced in December 2007 (RTM build number 4.0.7333.3 Microsoft CRM build numbers from version 4.0 to version 8). It features multi-tenancy, improved reporting security, data importing, direct mail merging and support for newer technologies such as Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 (Update Rollup 4).
Dynamics CRM 4.0 also implements CRM Online, a hosted solution that is offered directly by Microsoft. The multi-tenancy option also allows ISVs to offer hosted solutions to end customers as well.
Dynamics CRM 4.0 is the first version of the product, which has seen significant take up in the market and passed the 1 million user mark in July 2009.
Additional support for NxN relations was added, which solved a lot of 'in-between' entities. "Connections" were also introduced in favour of "Relations". The UI design was based on Office 2007 look and feel, with the same blue shading and round button as "start".


==== Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 ====
Dynamics CRM 2011 was released to open Beta in February 2010. It then went into Release Candidate stage in December 2010. The product was then released in February 2011 (build number 5.0.9688.583)
Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox browsers are fully supported since Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Update Rollup 12. Because of this browser compatibility R12 was highly anticipated but also caused a lot of stress for customers that had used unsupported customizations. R12 broke those customizations and clients had to rethink their changes. Microsoft offered additional wizards to pinpoint the problems.
