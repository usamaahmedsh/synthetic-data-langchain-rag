Gollum is wiki software that uses Git as the backend storage mechanism, and written mostly in Ruby. It started life as the wiki system used by the GitHub web hosting system. Although the open source Gollum project and the software currently used to run GitHub wikis have diverged from one another, Gollum strives to maintain compatibility with the latter.  Currently used by GitLab to store and interconnect wiki-pages with wiki-links; a complete move away from Gollum is planned for the future.
