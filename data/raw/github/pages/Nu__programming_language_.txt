Nu is an interpreted object-oriented programming language, with a Lisp-like syntax, created by Tim Burks as an alternative scripting language to program OS X through its Cocoa application programming interface (API). Implementations also exist for iPhone and Linux.
The language was first announced at C4, a conference for indie Mac developers held in August 2007.


== Example code ==
This Nu code defines a simple complex numbers class.

The example is a basic definition of a complex number: it defines the instance variables, and a method to initialize the object.  It shows the similarity between the code in Nu and the equivalent in Objective-C; it also shows the similarity with Ruby.

This sample, from the nuke tool bundled with Nu, also shows the influence of Objective-C, Lisp, and Ruby in the design of the language.
