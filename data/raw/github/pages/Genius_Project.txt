Cerri Consulting Group was founded in 1986 by Patrice Cerri. In 1997, the company launched Genius Project, a PPM software initially designed for IBM users, and became an IBM Premium Partner. Following its successful entry into the North American market in 2002, the company expanded into Asia in 2006 and established partnerships with Salesforce and SAP. In 2014, the company rebranded as Cerri.com AG, reflecting its broader focus on enterprise project management solutions.
In 2021, Cerri.com AG introduced Cerri Work, a new project collaboration software, and launched its updated website, www.cerri.com. The following year, the company joined the Microsoft marketplace and rebranded Genius Project as Cerri Project, aligning its products under a unified brand.
