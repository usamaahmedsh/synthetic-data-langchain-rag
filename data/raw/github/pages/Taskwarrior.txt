Taskwarrior is an open-source, cross platform time and task management tool, used to keep track of and handle tasks. It uses a command-line interface, although since its inception, graphical user interface wrappers have also been created.
Taskwarrior uses concepts and techniques described in Getting Things Done by David Allen, but is paradigm-agnostic in that it does not require users to adhere to any given life-management philosophy.
According to its author, Taskwarrior was created "to address layout and feature issues" in the Todo.txt applications popularized by Gina Trapani.
The authors offer an accompanying tool called Timewarrior for tracking time spent on projects. Configuration allows e. g. to define recurring breaks such as lunch time. The documentation notes that "Timewarrior focuses on accurately recording time already spent, whereas Taskwarrior looks forward to work that is not yet done."
Taskwarrior's source code is a free and open-source software and can be either compiled from source code to run on a variety of architectures and operating systems, or installed as a binary, which is available on many Linux distribution binary repositories.


== Typical Workflow ==
Taskwarrior comprises three main commands: add, list, and done. All other functionality – recurrences, tags, priorities, etc. – are optional.


=== Adding a task ===


=== Listing Tasks ===


=== Marking a task as completed ===


=== Creating a task with due dates, recurrences, and tags ===


== Syncing ==
When used in conjunction with Taskserver, can sync tasks into the cloud, and indirectly with other clients/devices.


== Accolades ==
Issue 124 of the UK Linux Format magazine (November 2009) featured Taskwarrior in its Hot Picks section.
RadioTux Talk #137 (July 2011, German) chose Taskwarrior as Hot Pick
