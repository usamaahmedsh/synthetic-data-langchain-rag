Mississippi Rising - The Concert in Support of the Hurricane Katrina Recovery Efforts (2005) telethon (2 DVD set) was quickly put together after Hurricane Katrina had devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States between 23 and 30 August 2005. This three-hour concert and telethon was broadcast live on MSNBC throughout North America on October 1, 2005.  It was marketed commercially as a 2 DVD set in very limited numbers.  All proceeds have gone to the Mississippi Hurricane Recovery Fund.


== Production ==
The production was telecast from the University of Mississippi (Oxford, MS) on 1 October 2005; C. M. Tad Smith Coliseum was converted into a television production facility in order to accommodate the media production, telecast, and live concert.   Native Mississippians, Sam Haskell III and Lanny Griffith produced the event.  The event was underwritten by a contribution to the Mississippi Hurricane Recovery Fund by UnitedHealth Group Foundation.
All proceeds went to the Mississippi Hurricane Recovery Fund (www.mississippirecovery.com) or a similar fund in Louisiana administered by Foundations for Recovery, The Hurricane Katrina New Orleans Recovery Fund (www.foundationsforrecovery.org). The event raised in excess of $15 million.
The event featured numerous celebrities backed by a live 50 piece studio orchestra.
After Hurricane Katrina, Whoopi Goldberg and director Penelope Spheeris collaborated to tell the stories of residents of Biloxi, Mississippi for MSNBC's "Mississippi Rising" telethon. Twelve two-three-minute short documentaries aired during the October 1, 2005 broadcast.
