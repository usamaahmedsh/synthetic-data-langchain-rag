Rubinius is an alternative Ruby implementation created by Evan Phoenix. Based loosely on the Smalltalk-80 Blue Book design, Rubinius seeks to
"provide a rich, high-performance environment for running Ruby code."


== Goals ==
Rubinius follows in the Lisp and Smalltalk traditions, by natively implementing as much of Ruby as possible in Ruby code.
It also has a goal of being thread-safe in order to be able to embed more than one interpreter in a single application.


== Sponsorship ==
From 2007 to 2013, Engine Yard funded one full-time engineer to work exclusively on Rubinius. Evan Phoenix now works at HashiCorp.


== PowerPC64 support ==
Since version 2.4.0, support on PowerPC64 is enabled.
