Dream11 is an Indian fantasy sports platform that allows users to play daily fantasy sports contests, primarily in cricket. The platform allowed users to take part in paid and free contests by assembling a virtual team of real-life players, and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance on the field of play. Paid contests were discontinued in August 2025 after the Parliament of India passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025.
In April 2019, Dream11 became the first Indian fantasy sport company to become a unicorn. In November 2021, Dream11 was valued at $8 billion. In October 2023, Dream11 claimed to have 200 million users.


== History ==
Dream11 was co-founded by Harsh Jain (son of Indian businessman Anand Jain) and Bhavit Sheth in 2008. In 2012, they introduced freemium fantasy sports in India for cricket fans. In 2014, the company reported 1 million registered users, which grew to 2 million in 2016 and to 45 million in 2018.
In April 2019, Steadview Capital completed secondary investment in Dream11. Apart from Steadview, Dream11's investors included Kalaari Capital, Think Investments, Multiples Equity and Tencent. In April 2019, they launched FanCode, an ad-free multi-sport aggregator platform offering content, commerce and community engagement.
In 2021, Dream 11's parent company, Dream Sports raised $840 million in a funding round led by Tiger Global, D1 Capital, Falcon Edge, DST Global, and Redbird Capital.


== Legality ==
In 2017, a case was registered against the company in an Indian High Court. The court, in its ruling, stated that playing the Dream11 game involves superior knowledge, judgement and attention. The Court also held that "the element of skill" had a predominant influence on the outcome of the Dream11 game. However, the law does not allow fantasy sports in a few Indian states like Assam, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. A challenge to this judgement was filed with the Supreme Court of India, which dismissed the appeal. The judgement provided legality to the company and allowed them to run their operations throughout the country.
In October 2021, Dream11 suspended its operations in Karnataka after the state prohibited online gambling, betting and wagering. In February 2022, Dream11 resumed operations in the state after the Karnataka High Court reversed the ban on online gambling and repealed a complaint lodged against the company.
Despite it being adjudged to be a "game of skill", experts believe that the company operates in the country's regulatory "grey area".


=== 2025 real money gaming ban ===

On 21 August 2025, after the Parliament of India passed an online gaming bill that outlawed all real money online games, Dream11 paused all paid contests on its platform, which accounted for over 90% of its revenue.
