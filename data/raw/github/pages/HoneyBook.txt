== History ==
HoneyBook was founded in 2013 by Oz and Naama Alon, along with Dror Shimoni. The concept originated while Naama Alon was planning her wedding in Tel Aviv, where she identified a lack of tools to organize event vendors. The company received its first institutional investment in 2013 from the accelerator UpWest Labs and investor Bobby Lent. Shortly after, HoneyBook moved its operations to San Francisco to target the U.S. market network,  while maintaining a technology office in Tel Aviv.
In 2015, HoneyBook raised $22 million in a Series B funding round to expand its services across major U.S. cities and broaden its focus beyond the wedding industry to general service professionals.
In 2021, HoneyBook raised $155 million in Series D funding, bringing the company’s valuation to $1.1 billion. A Series E round later that year brought in $250 million, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion. As of late 2021, the company reported that over $5 billion in business had been processed through its platform.
In 2025, HoneyBook introduced artificial intelligence features to assist users in pricing services based on aggregated data from comparable businesses.
