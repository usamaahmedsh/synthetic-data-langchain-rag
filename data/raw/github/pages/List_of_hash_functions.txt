This is a list of hash functions, including cyclic redundancy checks, checksum functions, and cryptographic hash functions.


== Cyclic redundancy checks ==

Adler-32 is often mistaken for a CRC, but it is not: it is a checksum.


== Checksums ==


== Universal hash function families ==


== Non-cryptographic hash functions ==


== Keyed cryptographic hash functions ==


== Unkeyed cryptographic hash functions ==
