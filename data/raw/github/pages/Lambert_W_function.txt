In mathematics, the Lambert W function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a multivalued function, namely the branches of the converse relation of the function 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        w
        )
        =
        w
        
          e
          
            w
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(w)=we^{w}}
  
, where w is any complex number and 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            w
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{w}}
  
 is the exponential function. The function is named after Johann Lambert, who considered a related problem in 1758. Building on Lambert's work, Leonhard Euler described the W function per se in 1783.
For each integer 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  
 there is one branch, denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            k
          
        
        
          (
          z
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{k}\left(z\right)}
  
, which is a complex-valued function of one complex argument. 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{0}}
  
 is known as the principal branch. These functions have the following property: if 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle w}
  
 are any complex numbers, then

  
    
      
        w
        
          e
          
            w
          
        
        =
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle we^{w}=z}
  

holds if and only if

  
    
      
        w
        =
        
          W
          
            k
          
        
        (
        z
        )
         
         
        
           for some integer 
        
        k
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle w=W_{k}(z)\ \ {\text{ for some integer }}k.}
  

When dealing with real numbers only, the two branches 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{0}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{-1}}

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}

        y
        
          e
          
            y
          
        
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle ye^{y}=x}
  

can be solved for 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
  
 only if 
  
    
      
        x
        ≥

The Lambert W function's branches cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. It is useful in combinatorics, for instance, in the enumeration of trees. It can be used to solve various equations involving exponentials (e.g. the maxima of the Planck, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–Dirac distributions) and also occurs in the solution of delay differential equations, such as 
  
    
      
        
          y
          ′
        
        
          (
          t
          )
        
        =
        a
         
        y
        
          (
          
            t
            −
            1
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y'\left(t\right)=a\ y\left(t-1\right)}
  
. In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme kinetics, an opened-form solution for the time-course kinetics analysis of Michaelis–Menten kinetics is described in terms of the Lambert W function.

The notation convention chosen here (with 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            0

) follows the canonical reference on the Lambert W function by Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth.
The name "product logarithm" can be understood as follows: since the inverse function of 
  
    
      
        f
        
          (
          w
          )
        
        =
        
          e
          
            w
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\left(w\right)=e^{w}}
  
 is termed the logarithm, it makes sense to call the inverse "function" of the product 
  
    
      
        w
        
          e
          
            w
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle we^{w}}
  
 the "product logarithm". (Technical note: like the complex logarithm, it is multivalued and thus W is described as a converse relation rather than inverse function.) It is related to the omega constant, which is equal to 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            0
          
        
        
          (
          1
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{0}\left(1\right)}
  
.


== History ==
Lambert first considered the related Lambert's Transcendental Equation in 1758, which led to an article by Leonhard Euler in 1783 that discussed the special case of 
  
    
      
        w
        
          e
          
            w
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle we^{w}}
  
.
The equation Lambert considered was 

  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          x
          
            m
          
        
        +
        q
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=x^{m}+q.}
  

Euler transformed this equation into the form

  
    
      
        
          x
          
            a
          
        
        −
        
          x
          
            b
          
        
        =
        (
        a
        −
        b
        )
        c
        
          x
          
            a
            +
            b
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{a}-x^{b}=(a-b)cx^{a+b}.}
  

Both authors derived a series solution for their equations.
Once Euler had solved this equation, he considered the case ⁠
  
    
      
        a
        =
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=b}
  
⁠. Taking limits, he derived the equation

  
    
      
        ln
        ⁡
        x
        =
        c
        
          x
          
            a
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ln x=cx^{a}.}
  

He then put ⁠
  
    
      
        a
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=1}
  
⁠ and obtained a convergent series solution for the resulting equation, expressing ⁠
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
⁠ in terms of ⁠
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  
⁠.
After taking derivatives with respect to ⁠
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
⁠ and some manipulation, the standard form of the Lambert function is obtained.
In 1993, it was reported that the Lambert ⁠
  
    
      
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle W}
  
⁠ function provides an exact solution to the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for equal charges—a fundamental problem in physics. Prompted by this, Rob Corless and developers of the Maple computer algebra system realized that "the Lambert W function has been widely used in many fields, but because of differing notation and the absence of a standard name, awareness of the function was not as high as it should have been."
Another example where this function is found is in Michaelis–Menten kinetics.
Although it was widely believed that the Lambert ⁠
  
    
      
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle W}
  
⁠ function cannot be expressed in terms of elementary (Liouvillian) functions, the first published proof did not appear until 2008.


== Elementary properties, branches and range ==

There are countably many branches of the W function, denoted by Wk(z), for integer k; W0(z) being the main (or principal) branch. W0(z) is defined for all complex numbers z while Wk(z) with k ≠ 0 is defined for all non-zero z, with W0(0) = 0 and 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            z
            →
            0
          
        
        
          W
          
            k
          
        
        (
        z
        )
        =
        
        −
        ∞
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim \limits _{z\to 0}W_{k}(z)=\;-\infty ,}
  
 for all k ≠ 0.
The branch point for the principal branch is at 
  
    
      
        z
        =
        −
        
          e
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z=-e^{-1}}
  
, with a branch cut that extends to −∞ along the negative real axis. This branch cut separates the principal branch from the two branches W−1 and W1. In all branches Wk with k ≠ 0, there is a branch point at z = 0 and a branch cut along the entire negative real axis.
The functions Wk(z), k ∈ Z are all injective and their ranges are disjoint. The range of the entire multivalued function W is the complex plane. The image of the real axis is the union of the real axis and the quadratrix of Hippias, the parametric curve w = −t cot t + it.

=== Derivative ===
By implicit differentiation, one can show that all branches of W satisfy the differential equation

  
    
      
        z
        (
        1
        +
        W
        )
        
          
            
              d
              W
            
            
              d
              z
            
          
        
        =
        W
        
        
          for 
        
        z
        ≠
        −
        
          
            1
            e
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle z(1+W){\frac {dW}{dz}}=W\quad {\text{for }}z\neq -{\frac {1}{e}}.}
  

(W is not differentiable for z = −⁠1/e⁠.) As a consequence, that gets the following formula for the derivative of W:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
              W
            
            
              d
              z
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              W
              (
              z
              )
            
            
              z
              (
              1
              +
              W
              (
              z
              )
              )
            
          
        
        
        
          for 
        
        z
        ∉
        
          {
          
            0
            ,
            −
            
              
                1
                e
              
            
          
          }
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dz}}={\frac {W(z)}{z(1+W(z))}}\quad {\text{for }}z\not \in \left\{0,-{\frac {1}{e}}\right\}.}
  

Using the identity eW(z) = ⁠z/W(z)⁠, gives the following equivalent formula:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              d

                  (

                  )
                
              
            
          
        
        
        
          for 
        
        z
        ≠
        −
        
          
            1
            e
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dz}}={\frac {1}{z+e^{W(z)}}}\quad {\text{for }}z\neq -{\frac {1}{e}}.}
  

At the origin we have

Where Pn is a polynomial function with coefficients defined in A042977. If and only if z is a root of Pn then zez is a root of the n-th derivative of W.

(The last equation is more common in the literature but is undefined at x = 0). One consequence of this (using the fact that W0(e) = 1) is the identity

== Taylor series and combinatorics ==
Cayley's formula states that the number of tree graphs on n labeled vertices is

            n

    {\displaystyle n^{n-2}}
  
, so that the number of trees with a designated root vertex is 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            n

. The exponential generating function of this counting sequence is:

The class of rooted trees has a natural recurrence: a rooted a tree is equivalent to a root vertex attached to a set of smaller rooted trees. Using the exponential formula for labeled combinatorial classes, this translates into the equation:
  
    
      
        T
        (
        x
        )
        =

          e
          
            T
            (
            x
            )
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle T(x)=xe^{T(x)},}

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle -T(-x)e^{-T(-x)}=x}
  
 and

        x

 can be found directly using the Lagrange inversion theorem:

            0

                )

    {\displaystyle W_{0}(x)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {(-n)^{n-1}}{n!}}x^{n},}

    {\displaystyle W_{0}(x)=\ln x-\ln \ln x+{\mathcal {o}}(1).}
  

The other real branch, W−1, defined in the interval [−⁠1/e⁠, 0), has an approximation of the same form as x approaches zero, in this case with L1 = ln(−x) and L2 = ln(−ln(−x)).


=== Integer and complex powers ===
Integer powers of W0 also admit simple Taylor (or Laurent) series expansions at zero:

More generally, for r ∈ Z, the Lagrange inversion formula gives

which is, in general, a Laurent series of order r. Equivalently, the latter can be written in the form of a Taylor expansion of powers of W0(x) / x:

which holds for any r ∈ C and |x| < ⁠1/e⁠.


== Bounds and inequalities ==
A number of non-asymptotic bounds are known for the Lambert function.


=== Principal branch ===
Hoorfar and Hassani showed that the following bound holds for x ≥ e:

              x
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ln x-\ln \ln x+{\frac {\ln \ln x}{2\ln x}}\leq W_{0}(x)\leq \ln x-\ln \ln x+{\frac {e}{e-1}}{\frac {\ln \ln x}{\ln x}}.}

        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=x+1}
  
 which gives the bound

Since f(x) = xex is not injective, it does not always hold that W(f(x)) = x, much like with the inverse trigonometric functions. For fixed x < 0 and x ≠ −1, the equation xex = yey has two real solutions in y, one of which is of course y = x. Then, for i = 0 and x < −1, as well as for i = −1 and x ∈ (−1, 0), y = Wi(xex) is the other solution.

The third identity may be derived from the second by making the substitution u = x−2 and the first can also be derived from the third by the substitution z = ⁠1/√2⁠ tan x. Deriving its generalization, the fourth identity, is only slightly more involved and can be done by substituting, in turn,

, observing that one obtains two integrals matching the definition of the gamma function, and finally using the properties of the gamma function to collect terms and simplify.
Except for z along the branch cut (−∞, −⁠1/e⁠] (where the integral does not converge), the principal branch of the Lambert W function can be computed by the following integral:

=== Solving equations ===
The Lambert W function is used to solve equations in which the unknown quantity occurs both in the base and in the exponent, or both inside and outside of a logarithm. The strategy is to convert such an equation into one of the form zez = w and then to solve for z using the W function.
For example, the equation

  
    
      
        
          3
          
            x
          
        
        =
        2
        x
        +
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 3^{x}=2x+2}
  

(where x is an unknown real number) can be solved by rewriting it as

=== Viscous flows ===
Granular and debris flow fronts and deposits, and the fronts of viscous fluids in natural events and in laboratory experiments can be described by using the Lambert–Euler omega function as follows:

  
    
      
        H
        (
        x
        )
        =

        +
        W
        
          (

            H
            (
            0
            )
            −
            1
            )
            
              e
              
                (
                H

                0

                −
                1
                )
                −

          )
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle H(x)=1+W\left((H(0)-1)e^{(H(0)-1)-{\frac {x}{L}}}\right),}
  

where H(x) is the debris flow height, x is the channel downstream position, L is the unified model parameter consisting of several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient.
In pipe flow, the Lambert W function is part of the explicit formulation of the Colebrook equation for finding the Darcy friction factor. This factor is used to determine the pressure drop through a straight run of pipe when the flow is turbulent.


=== Time-dependent flow in simple branch hydraulic systems ===
The principal branch of the Lambert W function is employed in the field of mechanical engineering, in the study of time dependent transfer of Newtonian fluids between two reservoirs with varying free surface levels, using centrifugal pumps. The Lambert W function provided an exact solution to the flow rate of fluid in both the laminar and turbulent regimes:

=== Materials science ===
The Lambert W function is employed in the field of epitaxial film growth for the determination of the critical dislocation onset film thickness. This is the calculated thickness of an epitaxial film, where due to thermodynamic principles the film will develop crystallographic dislocations in order to minimise the elastic energy stored in the films. Prior to application of Lambert W for this problem, the critical thickness had to be determined via solving an implicit equation. Lambert W turns it in an explicit equation for analytical handling with ease.


=== Semiconductor ===
It was shown that a W-function describes the relation between voltage, current and resistance in a diode.


=== Porous media ===
The Lambert W function has been employed in the field of fluid flow in porous media to model the tilt of an interface separating two gravitationally segregated fluids in a homogeneous tilted porous bed of constant dip and thickness where the heavier fluid, injected at the bottom end, displaces the lighter fluid that is produced at the same rate from the top end. The principal branch of the solution corresponds to stable displacements while the −1 branch applies if the displacement is unstable with the heavier fluid running underneath the lighter fluid.

This application shows that the branch difference of the W function can be employed in order to solve other transcendental equations.


=== Statistics ===
The centroid of a set of histograms defined with respect to the symmetrized Kullback–Leibler divergence (also called the Jeffreys divergence ) has a closed form using the Lambert W function.


=== Pooling of tests for infectious diseases ===
Solving for the optimal group size to pool tests so that at least one individual is infected involves the Lambert W function.


=== Exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation ===
The Lambert W function appears in a quantum-mechanical potential, which affords the fifth – next to those of the harmonic oscillator plus centrifugal, the Coulomb plus inverse square, the Morse, and the inverse square root potential – exact solution to the stationary one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is given as

  
    
      
        V
        =

              W
              
                (
                
                  e
                  
                    −
                    
                      
                        x
                        σ
                      
                    
                  
                
                )
              
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle V={\frac {V_{0}}{1+W\left(e^{-{\frac {x}{\sigma }}}\right)}}.}
  

A peculiarity of the solution is that each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by a combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions of an argument proportional to

  
    
      
        z
        =
        W
        
          (
          
            e
            
              −
              
                
                  x
                  σ
                
              
            
          
          )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle z=W\left(e^{-{\frac {x}{\sigma }}}\right).}
  

The Lambert W function also appears in the exact solution for the bound state energy of the one dimensional Schrödinger equation with a Double Delta Potential.

 is computed perturbatively, the order n corresponding to Feynman diagrams including n quantum loops. The first order, n = 1, solution is exact (at that order) and analytical. At higher orders, n > 1, there is no exact and analytical solution and one typically uses an iterative method to furnish an approximate solution. However, for second order, n = 2, the Lambert function provides an exact (if non-analytical) solution.


=== Exact solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations ===
In the Schwarzschild metric solution of the Einstein vacuum equations, the W function is needed to go from the Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates to the Schwarzschild coordinates. For this reason, it also appears in the construction of the Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates.


=== Resonances of the delta-shell potential ===
The s-wave resonances of the delta-shell potential can be written exactly in terms of the Lambert W function.

If a reaction involves reactants and products having heat capacities that are constant with temperature then the equilibrium constant K obeys

The first solution to this problem, due to Sommerfeld circa 1898, already contained an iterative method to determine the value of the Lambert W function.

Generalizations of the Lambert W function include:

An application to general relativity and quantum mechanics (quantum gravity) in lower dimensions, in fact a link (unknown prior to 2007) between these two areas, where the right-hand side of (1) is replaced by a quadratic polynomial in x:

where r1 and r2 are real distinct constants, the roots of the quadratic polynomial. Here, the solution is a function which has a single argument x but the terms like ri and a0 are parameters of that function. In this respect, the generalization resembles the hypergeometric function and the Meijer G function but it belongs to a different class of functions. When r1 = r2, both sides of (2) can be factored and reduced to (1) and thus the solution reduces to that of the standard W function. Equation (2) expresses the equation governing the dilaton field, from which is derived the metric of the R = T or lineal two-body gravity problem in 1 + 1 dimensions (one spatial dimension and one time dimension) for the case of unequal rest masses, as well as the eigenenergies of the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for unequal charges in one dimension.

Analytical solutions of the eigenenergies of a special case of the quantum mechanical three-body problem, namely the (three-dimensional) hydrogen molecule-ion. Here the right-hand side of (1) is replaced by a ratio of infinite order polynomials in x:

where ri and si are distinct real constants and x is a function of the eigenenergy and the internuclear distance R. Equation (3) with its specialized cases expressed in (1) and (2) is related to a large class of delay differential equations. G. H. Hardy's notion of a "false derivative" provides exact multiple roots to special cases of (3).

Applications of the Lambert W function in fundamental physical problems are not exhausted even for the standard case expressed in (1) as seen recently in the area of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.

Toshio Fukushima has presented a fast method for approximating the real valued parts of the principal and secondary branches of the W function without using any iteration. In this method the W function is evaluated as a conditional switch of rational functions on transformed variables:
