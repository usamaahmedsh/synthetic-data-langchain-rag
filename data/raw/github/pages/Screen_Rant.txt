Screen Rant is an entertainment website that offers news in the fields of television, films, video games, and comic books. It is owned by Valnet, parent of publications including Comic Book Resources, Collider, MovieWeb and XDA Developers.


== History ==
Screen Rant was launched by Vic Holtreman in 2003. In February 2015, Screen Rant was acquired by Valnet, an online media company based in Montreal, Quebec. It was combined with its sister site, Game Rant, in 2019, when Valnet acquired the other publication. After agreeing to sell Screen Rant to Valnet, founder Vic Holtreman, who had served as the company's CEO, retired.
Screen Rant features a video series called Pitch Meeting by YouTube comedian Ryan George. In the series, George plays both a screenwriter and a film producer in a pitch for a film or television series, describing its plot in a humorous way that highlights various inconsistencies.
