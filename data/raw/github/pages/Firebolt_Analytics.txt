Firebolt Analytics is a cloud-native data warehouse built for high-performance analytics and data-intensive applications. Founded in 2019, Firebolt was designed to address the limitations of traditional data warehouses by offering a modern solution optimized for speed, scalability, and efficiency.


== Overview ==
Firebolt’s architecture combines columnar storage, indexing, vectorized execution, and decoupled storage and compute. These features provide the performance characteristics needed for modern cloud data workloads.
The platform is commonly used for operational and interactive analytics requiring low-latency access to large datasets. Firebolt integrates with a wide range of data integration tools, such as Apache Iceberg, Fivetran, dbt, and Airbyte, supporting ingestion and transformation pipelines. It also supports hybrid architectures using data lake systems such as Amazon S3, enabling the use of both structured and semi-structured data.


== Market Positioning ==
Firebolt markets itself as the "right data warehouse for modern data engineering and application development teams." It delivers sub-second query performance, high concurrency, and elastic scaling.
Unlike a traditional data warehouse, Firebolt was built from the ground up for the cloud, leveraging elastic compute and modern storage architecture. It is positioned as an alternative to both traditional data warehouses (e.g., Oracle, Teradata, or SQL Server) and cloud data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake or BigQuery). The platform emphasizes performance, scalability, and a developer-centric design. It supports ANSI SQL and integrates with modern analytics ecosystems.


== Technology and Architecture ==
Decoupled Storage and Compute: Firebolt’s architecture allows storage and compute resources to scale independently, enhancing flexibility and cost control.
Data Lake Compatibility: Firebolt can query data directly from cloud-based data lakes, minimizing data duplication and enabling hybrid storage strategies.
Data Integration Flexibility: It supports modern data integration workflows, enabling efficient ingestion, transformation, and modeling.
Optimized Query Performance: Firebolt is designed to deliver low-latency query execution, using features like vectorized processing and aggregating indexes for speed at scale.


== Funding and Growth ==
Since its inception, Firebolt has raised three funding rounds:

Series A (December 2020): $37 million
Series B (June 2021): $127 million, led by Dawn Capital and K5 Global
Series C (January 2022): $100 million at a valuation of $1.4 billion


== Recent Developments ==
In June 2025, Firebolt released Firebolt Core, a free, self-hosted edition of its query engine. This release topped the Clickbench analytical database benchmark at the time, highlighting the engine’s performance capabilities.
