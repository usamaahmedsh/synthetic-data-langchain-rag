== History ==
TeamNote is a product started off its research and development in 2012, under its then-parent company Apptask Limited, a project-led mobile applications development company. TeamNote was originally developed for a Hong Kong local real estate conglomerate as a customized corporate communication app, which inspired its founder Roy Law and the team to develop TeamNote as a product.
TeamNote Limited as an independent company was founded in July 2013, after spinning off from its now-sister company Apptask Limited and TeamNote is officially launched to the Asia market in the first quarter of 2014.  In January 2015, TeamNote Limited as a startup company was shortlisted to be a part of Y Combinator's three-month-long accelerator programme and received $120,000 seed money and later raised approximately USD$1M angel round. TeamNote announced its global launch during an interview with TechCrunch in March 2015.
The original TeamNote app focused on secure messaging. This included password-protected conversations, the ability to send a message out to a group and get private replies, and even a feature to make sensitive messages disappear after a specific expiration date. As it expanded, the application has gained features for managing shifts for workers on the field, who can send back messages and photographs related to their work in to their company’s home base to complete tasks. There are also mobile training modules, letting teams quickly get new workers out on the field up to speed without making them sit down and watch an entire training session.


== Award ==
In 2014, TeamNote won the Red Herring (magazine) Asia Top 100 Technology Award in Hong Kong and Global Top 100 Technology Award in Los Angeles. In 2015, TeamNote won the Best Mobile Apps Grand Award and Best Mobile Apps (Business and Enterprise Solution) Gold Award in Hong Kong ICT Awards.
