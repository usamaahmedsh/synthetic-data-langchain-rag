web2project is a web-based, multi-user, multi-language project management application. It is an open-source software and free for any uses and is maintained by an open community of volunteer programmers. web2project, as collaborative software, allows for real-time interaction between task assignees and updates for participants.


== History ==
web2project started as a fork of dotProject in late 2007.
Since the entire original team membership consisted of former dotProject contributors, the design and development decisions were quite similar to dotProject itself. As time went on, the systems diverged though web2project has maintained a "converter" which allows dotProject users to perform a one-way conversion to web2project. At present, the web2project community suffers from fewer add-on modules and a smaller community in general.
As of July 2010, web2project is available via RPM install for Mandriva Linux.
