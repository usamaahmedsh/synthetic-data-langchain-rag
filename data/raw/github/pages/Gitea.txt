Gitea () is a forge software package for hosting software development version control using Git as well as other collaborative features like bug tracking, code review, continuous integration, kanban boards, tickets, and wikis. It supports self-hosting but also provides a free public first-party instance. It is a fork of Gogs and is written in Go. Gitea can be hosted on all platforms supported by Go including FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, and Windows. The project is funded on Open Collective.


== History ==

Gitea is an open-source Git service created by Lunny Xiao, who was also a founder of its predecessor, the self-hosted Git service Gogs. Xiao invited a group of users and contributors from the Gogs community to join in the development of Gitea. While Gogs was open-source, its repository was controlled by a single maintainer, which limited community input and development speed. In response to these limitations, the Gitea developers decided to fork Gogs in November 2016, creating a community-driven development model. Gitea had its official 1.0 release in December 2016.


=== Forgejo fork ===

In October 2022, maintainers Lunny Xiao and Matti Ranta founded the company Gitea Limited with the goal of offering hosting services using specialized versions of Gitea that were not released as open-source, splitting the supported variants of Gitea between the Gitea Limited-provided installation and the original version licensed under the MIT License. The shift away from a community ownership model received resistance from some contributors, which led to the formation of a software fork called Forgejo. Consequently, the software forge Codeberg began using Forgejo instead of Gitea.
