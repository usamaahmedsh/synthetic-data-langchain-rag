Bing Product Upload (codenamed Agora, formerly Windows Live Product Upload and Live Search Product Upload) was part of Microsoft's Bing search engine. It enabled online shoppers using Bing Shopping to find easily find merchant's products.
Product Upload helped merchants to upload their product catalogs in either text or XML file formats. It supported bulk uploads using FTP and browser-based uploads using HTTP. After the products were uploaded, they became visible to online shoppers using Bing Shopping. Shoppers were able to view prices, descriptions, and product images, and a direct link to the merchant's website to purchase their products. Merchants required a Windows Live ID to log in and sign up.
Bing Product Upload was discontinued on 15 May 2009.
