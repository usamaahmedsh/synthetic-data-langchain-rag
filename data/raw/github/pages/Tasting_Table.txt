Tasting Table (incorporated as TDT Media Inc.) is an American digital media company focused on food and drink. The brand's website and email newsletter report on food and drink trends in the categories of dining, wine, cocktails, cooking, and food travel. In addition to publishing original articles, photos, and videos, Tasting Table hosts events including the Lobster Rumble, held annually in New York City and Los Angeles.


== History ==
Tasting Table was founded in 2008 by Geoff Bartakovics and John McDonald, with backing from the Pilot Group, a private equity firm established by Bob Pittman.


== Lobster Rumble ==
Since 2010, Tasting Table has hosted an annual lobster roll competition. Originally called the Lobster Roll Claw-Off and hosted only in New York City, the event, now named Tasting Table' Lobster Rumble, occurs annually in New York City in June of each year and moves to Los Angeles in August. It brings lobster roll purveyors from across the country together to compete for the title of Fan Favorite, selected by event attendees, or Editor's Choice, selected by Tasting Table editors.  The 2014 New York Lobster Rumble hosted 20 competitors and 2,000 attendees, while the Los Angeles Lobster Rumble included 13 competitors and 1,000 attendees.


== DINE by Tasting Table ==
In 2015, Tasting Table acquired Flavour, a restaurant discovery app that The New York Times once called "powerful" and "eye-catching". Tasting Table subsequently relaunched the app as DINE by Tasting Table. DINE is a curated restaurant finder that makes it easy to discover dining destinations. While Tasting Table editors have selected the restaurants included in each of the app's eight cities, DINE aggregates reviews from nearly 30 local and national publications, critics, and epicurean websites.
