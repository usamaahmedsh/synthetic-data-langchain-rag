== File format ==
Xmind saves content in an Xmind Workbook file format. The .xmind format suffix is used.
An Xmind workbook may contain more than one sheet, as in spreadsheet software. Each sheet may contain multiple topics, including one central topic, multiple main topics and multiple floating topics. Various structures can be inserted in one mind map, allowing the mind map to visualize information in different ways.
The latest .xmind file format implementing Xmind Workbooks consists of a ZIP compressed archive containing an JSON document for contents, a .png image file for thumbnails, and some directories for attachments. The file format is open and based on some principles of OpenDocument/OfficeOpenXML.
