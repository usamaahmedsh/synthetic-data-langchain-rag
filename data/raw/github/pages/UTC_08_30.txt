== History ==
This time zone became the Local Mean Time in Davao Oriental and in easternmost areas of the Philippines from Wednesday, January 1, 1845, until May 10, 1899 (Gregorian calendar), mandated by the virtue of Claveria's decree to reform the country calendar by skipping Tuesday, December 31, 1844, that redrew the International Date Line from being west of the country to go east and made the Philippines have same dates with the rest of Asia. Therefore, the entire archipelago was transferred from being on the calendar date of the Western Hemisphere to the Eastern Hemisphere. It was an entire day behind its neighboring Asian territories for 323 years, 9 months, and 4 days since Magellan's arrival in Limasawa on Saturday, March 16, 1521 (Julian Calendar), which was caused by the tricky and unmentioned international date line during the 16th century.
UTC+08:30 was Standard Time of South Korea from 1954 to 1961 and it was the time zone of North Korea from 2015 to 2018. This time was also used for Changpai Time Zone in northeast China between 1918 and 1949.
