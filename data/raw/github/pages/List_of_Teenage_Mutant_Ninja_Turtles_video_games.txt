Video games based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise have been produced since 1989, largely by Japanese video game manufacturer Konami.
Earlier games were mostly based on the 1987 TV series, with elements borrowed from the movies, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures, action figures and the original Mirage comic books and role-playing books. Several games released in the 2000s were based on the 2003 TV series and the 2007 film. A number of games released in the following decade have been based on the 2012 TV series, the 2014 film, and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
As of 1993, the first eleven TMNT video games sold 18 million units worldwide, earning nearly $450 million in sales revenue.
