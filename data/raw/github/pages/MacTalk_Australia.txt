MacTalk Australia was an online forum dedicated to news, support & discussion amongst Apple enthusiasts or potential users, with an Australian bias.
After its inception in 2004, the forum quickly became a top 10 tech site receiving hundreds of thousands of visits per month.  In 2011 the site was sold to Niche Media, owner of Macworld Australia Magazine, and by 2015 a message by the sites' volunteer moderators declared the site dead.


== History ==


=== Origins ===
AppleTalk Australia was founded on 1 January 2004 by Matt "Disko" Kelsh and Anthony "decryption" Agius, after meeting on another tech forum - Overclockers Australia - and banding together to create an online forum for Australian Apple users. The name was borrowed from Apple's own networking product, AppleTalk. The site was initially run through voluntary labour and donations, before turning to a commercial venture, with advertising assisting in the running costs of the site.


=== Name Change ===
In 2006 AppleTalk was rebranded MacTalk Australia. Whilst the site had initially flown under Apple's radar (for using its trademarked name "AppleTalk"), a disgruntled forum member reportedly alerted Apple to the forum's existence, leading to Apple's renowned legal team contacting Agius with a demand to change the forum's name. As the forum was already moving towards becoming a commercial venture, it was rebadged as MacTalk Australia.


=== Controversy ===
In 2008 Agius published claims that Apple had briefed resellers on the Australian iPhone release and later posted pictures of a box that had been sent to a local reseller, labelled "Do Not Open Until 10 June".


=== Awards ===
From July 2004 to June 2005 AppleTalk Australia was ranked #19 in the Hitwise Australia 'News and Media — IT Media' industry based on number of visits, improving to #8 between October and December 2005.


=== Domain and Name ===
The site was originally registered at appletalk.ma.cx but was switched to appletalkaustralia.com on 8 January 2004. In late 2006, to avoid any further trademark issues the site was renamed "MacTalk Australia" on the domain mactalk.com.au


=== MacTalk Members Unite ===
In late August 2008 site founder Anthony "decryption" Agius put out the call to raise $8,500 for a new server. In just four days, MacTalk members raised $5,800. A thank you thread was made shortly after by Anthony, thanking all for their help.


=== Founder's Exit ===
In February 2011, Agius put the site up for sale on auction website Flippa.com for "offers of more than $125,000". In June the same year Agius found a buyer in Niche Media, publishers of Macworld Australia magazine. In an interview, Agius said that "after such a significant financial and personal investment I'm walking away with a significant redundancy package".  The transition was temporarily held up when co-founder Matt "Disko" Kelsh, who had left before the site became commercial, threatened legal action over the sale.  The sale eventually went ahead for a reported $150,000.
MacTalk's last publisher was Liana Pappas.


== Forum ==
MacTalk's forums run on VBulletin and VBAdvanced.


=== Forum Software ===
The forum originally ran on Invision Power Board 1.3 with a highly customised skin, created by "the_argon". Due to the heavy customisation, an upgrade of the software was fraught with great difficulty and indefinitely put off, but in April 2006 was rebuilt around Invision Power Board version 2.1.4 after the site was hacked. However, due to changes in IPB updates breaking the customised skin, the board was not updated and as a result was hacked once again in October 2006. Rather than rebuild around IPB again, the admins decided to rebuild the skin around vBulletin, this time not using a wrapper, but entirely using the theme engine built in. The adapted skin was built by "iSlayer" over a week-long period while the forums were down. The old database was migrated and the site brought up again. As of October 2010, the front page, generated using Wordpress, was designed by a third party.


=== Media Mentions ===
26 April 2005 - Discussion of the iTunes Music Store in Australia mentioned.
7 March 2007 - A user discovers that the latest version of iTunes mentions TV ratings for Australia, suggesting Apple may be planning to release TV shows through the Australian iTunes Store. The discovery is reported in The Age newspaper.
