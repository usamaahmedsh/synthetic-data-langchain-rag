ITVX is a British over-the-top, ad-supported streaming service operated by ITV plc. The service offers original content from the broadcaster, livestreams of the ITV television channels, FAST channels, and exclusive and licensed programming.
The service succeeds the ITV Hub; which originally launched on 5 December 2008 and had at least 30 million registered users by July 2019.


== History ==
In March 2022, ITV announced the launch of ITVX, an integrated advertising and subscription-funded platform. The service serves as a replacement for ITV Hub, taking over as the broadcaster's catch-up service, and is positioned as a direct competitor to BBC iPlayer and the Channel 4 VOD service, featuring more exclusive programming and a selection of FAST channels.
During the same month, it was announced that ITV bought out the BBC's share in the UK version of BritBox, and would also include access to the service for ITVX Premium subscribers. The BBC will continue to operate the international BritBox service while remaining a content provider for ITVX.
The service was rolled out on 17 November 2022 before officially launched on 8 December.
On 28 February 2023, it was confirmed that ITVX Premium users would have access to StudioCanal Presents, which launched in the spring of that year. On 10 March 2023, it was confirmed that ITVX would become the new home of CITV content, with the launch of a dedicated hub called "ITVX Kids" from 22 July 2023.
On 30 May 2024, AMC Reality shows were added to the service.
By April 2024, BritBox UK ceased to exist as a standalone platform and was fully absorbed into ITVX's premium tier.
On 5 April 2025, content licensed from StudioCanal was removed from the service after the deal between the company and ITV ended.
On 10 July 2025, Disney and ITV announced they would share shows and films, marketed as a ‘Taste of ITVX’ and a ‘Taste of Disney+’. ITV shows appearing on Disney+ included Endeavour and The 1% Club whilst Disney content appearing on ITVX included Andor and Lilo & Stitch: The Series. Kevin Lygo, Managing Director of Media and Entertainment, ITV said “Disney are fantastic partners with a brilliant breadth of content. This mutually beneficial alliance allows us to show our complementary audiences a specially selected collection of titles, regularly updating, that gives a flavour of the range in our respective offerings. For us, this deal means even more great content for viewers on ITVX, and even more opportunity for viewers to find and enjoy our distinctive titles and services.”

On 7 November 2025, ITV confirmed it was in talks to sell its media and entertainment division (which includes the TV channels and ITVX) to Comcast subsidiary Sky for £1.6 billion. ITV Studios would not be included.

== ITV Hub ==
 

The ITV Player, later known as the ITV Hub, was launched in 2008.
The ITV Player was originally a website, and was then extended to television and other platforms. Initially, the website used Microsoft Silverlight rather than Adobe Flash as used by BBC iPlayer and Channel 4's 4oD, and Windows Media Video, but changed to Flash on 15 September 2009.
In November 2009, ITV Player was revamped, improving navigation and making the site more visually appealing. The service was free to use, funded by pre-, mid-, and post-roll advertisements. Users had been able to use ad-blocking software, but in mid-2010 the ITV website was upgraded to detect ad-blocking software. Video is sent at multiple bit rates and uses adaptive technology in the player to best determine the rate based on the user's connection. ITV Hub used HTML5 Media Source Extensions with Encrypted Media Extensions to deliver video.
In summer 2011, ITV Player incorporated subtitles and CITV programming. The redesigned website was launched on 22 August 2011 with upgraded search features, and a new more reliable Flash-based video player.
On 29 October 2012 the site started offering paid-for content in addition to the existing free 30-day catch-up.
Content only broadcast on the main ITV channel (rather than also on ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, or CITV) was only available to viewers located in ITV plc regions: England, Wales, southern Scotland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, and on UTV in Northern Ireland. If the same programme had also been broadcast in central and northern Scotland, users located in those areas may be able to view it on the STV Player, using the location provided by the user's ISP. On 6 June 2016, ITV Hub replaced the UTV Player service in Northern Ireland, following the latter's sale to ITV plc in February 2016.
Domino's Pizza became the platform's first sponsor, on 6 March 2018.
