In some operating systems, vol is a command within the command-line interpreters (shells) such as COMMAND.COM and cmd.exe. It is used to display the volume label and volume serial number of a logical drive, such as a hard disk partition or a floppy disk, if they exist.


== Implementations ==

The command is available in various versions of DOS, DR FlexOS, IBM/Toshiba 4690 OS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows, and ReactOS.
On MS-DOS, the command is available in versions 2 and later. Paragon Technology Systems PTS-DOS 2000 Pro also includes a vol implementation.
The Windows dir command also displays the volume label and serial number (if it has one) as part of the directory listing.
The command is also available in the EFI shell.


== Syntax ==
vol [Drive:]

Arguments:

Drive: This command-line argument specifies the drive letter of the disk for which to display the volume label and serial number.
Note:

On Windows, the volume serial number is displayed only for disks formatted with MS-DOS version 4.0 or later.
OS/2 allows the user to specify more than one drive. The vol command displays the volume labels consecutively.


== Examples ==

In the example above, if drive C: has no volume label, "has no label" is shown instead of "is Windows".
