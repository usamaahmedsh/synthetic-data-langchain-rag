YouTrack is a proprietary, commercial browser-based bug tracker, issue tracking system, and project management software developed by JetBrains.


== Overview ==
YouTrack's Ajax-based user interface allows both keyboard and mouse interaction. Searching for issues is implemented via search query syntax and is performed from a single search box.
YouTrack uses the language-oriented programming paradigm. The frontend is written in JavaScript, while the backend relies on Kotlin, a programming language created by the same software house. It uses an embedded Xodus database to read and store data. For remote procedure calls, YouTrack supports a RESTful API. JetBrains offers YouTrack in cloud-hosted and on-premises versions.
YouTrack Standard supports integrations such as imports from Jira, Mailbox Integration, Zendesk integration, and an integrated working environment with Upsource and TeamCity. The platform has pre-built connectors with GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab.
YouTrack can also be integrated with the Slack workplace. YouTrack can integrate with JetBrains IDEs.
YouTrack provides a REST API, which allows developers to perform various actions such as creating and modifying issues, and creating custom integrations.
