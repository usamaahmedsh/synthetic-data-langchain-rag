== History ==
The author said that at the time of starting the site "if you flipped open the newspaper it was filled with the same stuff every day. The polar ice caps were melting, there were pirates storming the seas, the economy was on the verge of collapse, and there were wars going on all over the world." As a result, he created a website discussing "popping bubble wrap, or snow days, or the smell of a bakery." In later interviews, and through a series on his blog, Pasricha shared that his divorce and a friend's suicide prompted him to continue looking for positive things in life.
