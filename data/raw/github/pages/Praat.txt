Praat ( PRAHT; Dutch: [praːt]  transl. "Talk") is a free, open-source computer software package widely used for speech analysis and synthesis in phonetics and other fields of linguistics. It was designed and continues to be developed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink at the University of Amsterdam. Praat is compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Unix, Linux, Mac, and Microsoft Windows. The software supports formant analysis, pitch extraction, and spectrogram visualization, along with speech synthesis, including articulatory synthesis. Praat has been used in linguistic research on endangered and minority languages, as well as for analyzing regional accents and phonetic variation.
