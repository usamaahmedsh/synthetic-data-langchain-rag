Asana, Inc. ( or ) is an American software company based in San Francisco whose flagship Asana service is a web and mobile "work management" platform designed to help teams organize, track, and manage their work.

== History ==
The co-founders met at Facebook, where Moskovitz, Facebook's co-founder and vice president of engineering, and his colleague Rosenstein created a productivity tool called Tasks. In 2008, the co-founders left Facebook to start Asana.  A Sanskrit word they chose as the name refers to the place and bodily posture yogi adopts to meditate. With their choice, co-founders wanted to describe their aim to build a product that simplifies things — Asana, a pose, is the result of the combination of form and fluidity to stay focused. Asana officially launched for free out of beta in November 2011 and commercially in April 2012. 
In 2014, Asana launched its native iOS app and in January 2015, Asana released its native Android app. In 2016, Asana raised $50 million in Series C financing led by Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator. In 2017, Asana integrated with Gmail, and launched its app in French and German.
By January 2018, more than 35,000 paying customers were using Asana, including CityFibre, AB-InBev, Viessmann, eBay, Uber, Overstock.com, Navy Federal Credit Union, Icelandair, and IBM. That same year, the company raised $75 million in Series D funding led by Generation Investment Management, a firm backed by Al Gore. In November 2018, Asana raised another $50 million in funding in Series E to invest in international and product expansion.
In September 2020, Asana went public on the New York Stock Exchange via a direct public offering. In August 2021, Asana dual listed on the Long-Term Stock Exchange.
By December 2021, Asana's customer count increased to 114,000 with two million paid seats globally and 739 of these were spending $50,000 or more on an annualized basis.

In April 2022, Asana released its annual Anatomy of Work Index. The report surveyed the behaviors and attitudes of more than 10,000 knowledge workers globally to highlight differences and year-over-year trends in the modern workplace.
In September 2022, Asana had 131,000 customers, while the number of customers spending over $5,000 annually increased to 18,040, up 41%.
In March 2025, Moskovitz announced his intention to retire from the company and transition to a chairman role once the company's board finds a replacement CEO. In June 2025, the company announced that Dan Rogers, formerly CEO of software company LaunchDarkly, would succeed Moskovitz as CEO effective July 21, 2025.
