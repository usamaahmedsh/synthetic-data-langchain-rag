Live Search Books was a search service for books launched in December 2006, part of Microsoft's Live Search range of services. Microsoft was working with a number of libraries, including the British Library, to digitize books and make them searchable, and in the case of out-of-copyright books, available across the web.
Microsoft was running a Live Search Books Publisher Program (previously referred to as Windows Live Publisher) to encourage book publishers to send their books to be scanned and indexed for the service.
In May 2008, Microsoft closed their Live Search Books and Live Search Academic services, those results integrated into regular Search and/or returned to their owners.  The project had scanned 750,000 books and indexed 80 million journal articles. The books scanned during the project are still available through Internet Archive, the organization that was hired by Microsoft to scan the books. Some scanning was also performed by Kirtas Technologies.
