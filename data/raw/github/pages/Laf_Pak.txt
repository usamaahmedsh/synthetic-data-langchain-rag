David H. Ahl for Creative Computing said "All in all, Laf Pak offers a lot of game playing value per dollar, and you are almost sure to find one or more of the games on this disk to your liking."
Softalk said "Four different games, most with recognizable keyboard controls, and each with its own challenges. What to do with all the money you save? Invest in a set of paddles or a joystick if you don't already have one."
Ferrell Wheeler for Hardcore Computist said "Laf Pak is a collection of four small but very enjoyable and playable games."
