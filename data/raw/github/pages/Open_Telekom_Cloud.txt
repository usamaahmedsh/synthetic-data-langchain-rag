The Open Telekom Cloud (OTC) is a public cloud computing service provided by Deutsche Telekom AG. It is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering based on OpenStack technology and operated in data centers owned by T-Systems, located in Biere and Magdeburg, Germany. Since 2021, additional data centers are located in Almere and Aalsmeer, Netherlands, and since 2022 in Bern and Zollikofen, Switzerland.


== Concept ==
The Open Telekom Cloud is a public cloud service aimed at business customers, especially those for whom compliance with German data protection laws and GDPR standards is essential, and those interested in maintaining regional data sovereignty. Deutsche Telekom AG introduced the platform on March 14, 2016, at the CeBIT technology fair in Hannover.


== Architecture ==
Open Telekom Cloud utilizes OpenStack distribution, enabling users to dynamically manage resources via a self-service portal or API. Customers can individually configure computing, storage, networking, and related resources as needed.


== Services ==
The Open Telekom Cloud offers a range of services including computing, storage, networking, database solutions, big data analytics, and AI solutions. Supported operating systems include Ubuntu.
As of 2024, the Biere data center provided storage for approximately 970 petabytes of data on around 100,000 servers, covering a total area of about 11,000 square meters.
Significant collaborative projects include working with CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, to evaluate scientific data processing in commercial cloud environments. Additionally, the Open Telekom Cloud serves as the infrastructure for Mundi Web Services, providing access and processing capabilities for the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program satellites' data.
