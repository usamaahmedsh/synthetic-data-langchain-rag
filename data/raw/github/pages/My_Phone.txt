My Phone was a Microsoft online service with a companion mobile client application for phones using the Windows Mobile 6 operating system, available from 2009 to 2011. It provided a free mobile phone back-up solution by wirelessly synchronizing contacts, calendar appointments, tasks, text messages, browser favorites, photos, music, video and documents with a password-protected online portal where users could access and manage their information. The service also enabled photo sharing and, in some markets, a set of features for dealing with a lost phone that were sold as a Premium Package requiring a one-time fee. My Phone supported Windows Mobile OS versions 6.0, 6.1 and 6.5 and was available globally in 25 languages. The service used Windows Live ID for authentication and the Windows Live server infrastructure for storing user information. The service was discontinued on August 7, 2011; data (contacts, calendar entries, text messages, and photos) was moved to SkyDrive, later renamed OneDrive.
