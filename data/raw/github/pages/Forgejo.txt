Forgejo (Esperanto pronunciation: [forˈd͡ʒe.jo]) is software for hosting a forge using the Git version control system to aid with software development. The package allows developers to use collaborative features like bug tracking, code review, continuous integration, kanban boards, issue tracking system tickets, and wikis with their projects. The package is designed to be self-hosted by developers, and a public instance is provided to try out the software, however forges that are hosted by organizations such as Codeberg are more commonly used. Forgejo can be hosted on all platforms that support the Go runtime, including macOS and Microsoft Windows, and packages are provided for various Linux distributions.


== History ==
Forgejo was initially created in December 2022 as a fork of Gitea. The fork occurred after a for-profit limited corporation ran by the lead maintainer of the project, Lunny Xiao, silently transferred Gitea's trademarks and operations to the company and began to establish an open-core model.
After it became public, Gitea contributors signed an open letter asking for the project's trademarks and domains to be placed under community management. After that was rejected, the project was forked. Codeberg, one of the major forges using Gitea at the time, migrated to Forgejo and has become the de jure lead maintainers of the project.
While initially being synchronized with the Gitea codebase, Forgejo eventually abandoned the practice and split from Gitea following version 1.21 in February 2024, In August 2024, Forgejo moved from the MIT license to the copyleft GNU General Public License. While the original code is still MIT, the overall project is licensed under the GPL. 
One of the main goals for the future of Forgejo is their plan to implement interoperability between different installations. While repositories can be mirrored from any other Git forge, the project has begun work on implementing support for the ActivityPub protocol, allowing users to collaborate with each other using Forgejo's features. The project has received funding from the NLnet organization for both the protocol extension needed to accommodate the feature subset, dubbed as "ForgeFed", and its implementation into Forgejo. As of 2025, the ability to federate "stars" on repositories across Forgejo installations has been built, while other forge packages such as GitLab have also begun work on implementing support for ForgeFed.


== Users ==
Codeberg is known as being the largest server running Forgejo and is one of the project's primary contributors, hosting more than 300,000 repositories as of November 2025. 
The Fedora Linux project is replacing their forge Pagure with Forgejo. Following the use of Copilot by GitHub, some people have moved to Codeberg or self-hosting Forgejo.
