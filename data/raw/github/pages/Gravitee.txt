Gravitee.io is a privately held software company which provides an open core platform for full-lifecycle management of application programming interfaces (APIs) and event-driven systems. Its offering supports both synchronous (e.g., REST, GraphQL) and asynchronous (e.g., message broker, streaming) architectures. The company was founded in France and has offices in Europe and North America, and it serves organisations across multiple industries.


== History ==
Gravitee was founded in 2015 by four freelance developers after seeing how much companies were struggling to manage the growing complexity of APIs – software go-betweens that enable applications and systems to talk to each other.
Initially conceived as an open-source alternative to legacy API management platforms, the company's early growth centred on its Lille, France base.
In July 2021, Gravitee.io raised €9.3 million in its first venture-capital funding round, co-led by AlbionVC and Oxx.
In September 2022, Gravitee.io raised USD$30 million in a Series B funding round led by Riverside Acceleration Capital (RAC), with additional support from Kreos Capital and Series A investors AlbionVC and Oxx.
In May 2025 it secured USD$60 million in a Series C funding round led by Sixth Street Growth with participation from Riverside Acceleration Capital and Albion VC.
In July 2025, Gravitee.io acquired Ambassador Labs, a US-based company specialising in cloud-native ingress/API gateway and AI-powered API design tools (Edge Stack and Blackbird), expanding its North American footprint.


== Products / services ==
