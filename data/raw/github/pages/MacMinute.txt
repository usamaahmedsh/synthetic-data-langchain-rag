MacMinute  was the name of a web site that provided news and information focused on Apple Inc and the Macintosh Operating system. It was founded by Canadian businessman Stan Flack in 2001 to "keep you up-to-date on everything that is going on in the world of Macintosh as soon as it happens". On the opening day, May 9, 2001, the update to the Mac OS X to 10.0.3 was announced.
Prior to creating MacMinute Stan Flack founded the MacCentral news website which he sold to MacWorld on June 1, 1999. This website was eventually folded into the MacWorld brand name and the last vestiges of MacCentral disappeared with the incorporation of the MacCentral Forum into the MacWorld forums in December 2007.
MacMinute was noted for its up to the minute digest of current breaking news about everything connected to the Macintosh and Apple products but one of its more important functions was to serve as a forum for the Macintosh community. This MacMinute Reader Cafe is an eclectic mix of Macintosh users who provide and share expertise in all aspects of the Macintosh platform.
Mr. Flack died of natural causes, from complications to a pre-existing condition, in his home on Prince Edward Island, Canada on April 14, 2008.
On May 22, 2008, the Flack family announced the closing of the Macminute website and forums. Some forum members decide to move to MacCentral Cafe as it reminds them of the single forum Stan Flack started with at the MacCentral news website.
On June 5, 2008 it is announced on the Macminute news site that MacTech's Community News Scan and Macsimum News will act as caretakers to the archives of MacMinute News and Forums. They also announced they would continue to host the MacMinute Forums which are now up and running smoothly as of November 2008. Stan's Lounge is crowded with MacCentral and MacMinute faithful in honor of Stan Flack and all that he did for the Macintosh community.
