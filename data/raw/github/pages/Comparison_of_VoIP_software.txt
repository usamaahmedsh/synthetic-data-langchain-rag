This is a comparison of voice over IP (VoIP) software that examines applications and systems used for conducting voice and multimedia communications across Internet Protocol (IP) networks. VoIP technology has transformed telecommunications by offering alternatives to traditional telephony systems while providing enhanced features and cost savings.
For residential users, VoIP services typically provide significant cost advantages compared to traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN) services. These systems eliminate geographic restrictions on phone numbers, enabling users to maintain local numbers in any area code regardless of their physical location. For example, a user can operate a New York phone number while residing in Tokyo, facilitating global mobility and reducing international communication costs.
In enterprise environments, VoIP technology enables the consolidation of voice and data networks into a unified IP infrastructure. This consolidation eliminates the need for separate voice and data pipelines while providing advanced capabilities including:

Unified communications integration
Presence management systems
Advanced call routing
Mobile device integration
Multimedia conferencing capabilities
Softphone applications serve as the primary client-side implementation of VoIP technology. These applications transform standard computing devices into full-featured communication endpoints, supporting voice and video calls over IP networks while providing standard telephony functions. Most softphone clients utilize the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), an open standard that supports various audio and video codecs. Some systems, like Skype, operate on proprietary protocols but can integrate with SIP-based systems through specialized business telephone system (PBX) software.
The VoIP ecosystem encompasses various specialized applications beyond basic communication endpoints:


== Core components ==

Conferencing servers for large-scale virtual meetings
Intercom systems for internal communications
Virtual foreign exchange services (FXOs)
Hybrid systems supporting both VoIP and PSTN integration


== Specialized applications ==

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
Automated dictation platforms
Professional call recording solutions
Custom hold music and messaging systems
VoIP implementations generally fall into two categories:

Web-based solutions that operate through browsers, offering simplified deployment and platform independence
Standalone desktop applications that provide enhanced features, superior reliability, and advanced feature sets


== Desktop applications ==


== Mobile phones ==
For mobile VoIP clients:


== Frameworks and libraries ==


== Server software ==


== Secure VoIP software ==


=== VoIP software with client-to-client encryption ===
The following table is an overview of those VoIP clients which (can) provide end-to-end encryption.
