== History ==
The company was founded in 1981 by Joseph Larson, who also served as the company's first president. Doug Burgum, who later went on to become a future Governor of North Dakota and United States Secretary of the Interior, joined the company in March 1983 as a shareholder. Burgum provided seed capital for the company; he bought out its other investors in early 1984 and became its new president. Larson continued to serve as a company director until its acquisition.
The company grew to about 170 employees by 1987, and had around 290 employees by 1989. It earned about $300 million in annual sales and had its IPO in 1997, after using the Internet to help it expand beyond North Dakota. In 1999 the company acquired Match Data Systems, a development team in the Philippines. In 2000, after several layoffs, it announced its acquisition by Microsoft for $1.1 billion. The purchase was completed in 2001.
Its products were rebranded "Microsoft Dynamics GP" in 2005, part of Microsoft Dynamics 365 as of 2016.
