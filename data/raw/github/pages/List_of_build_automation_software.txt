This page lists notable software build automation tools and systems.


== Sequencing ==
These tools sequence build operations – often based on dependencies – sometimes running tasks in parallel.

Apache Ant – Java build tool; uses XML format for configuration files
Apache Maven – Software tool for managing build dependencies
ASDF
Bazel – Software tool that automates software builds and tests
BitBake – Build automation tool often used for building Linux distributions; written in Python
Boot; written in Clojure
Boost boost.build – For C++ projects, cross-platform, based on Perforce Jam
Buck – Build system developed and used by Meta Platforms; written in Rust, using Starlark (BUILD file syntax) as Bazel
Buildout; Python-based
Cabal
Cargo The Rust package manager and Build tool.
D Dub – Official package and build manager of the D Language
Flowtracer – Build management toolPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets
Gradle – Free software build automation tool; with a Groovy- and Kotlin-based domain specific language (DSL), combining features of Apache Ant and Apache Maven with more features like a reliable incremental build
Grunt – JavaScript build tool
Gulp – Server-side JavaScript build tool
IncrediBuild – Grid computing softwarePages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets
Leiningen – Build automation tool; for Clojure projects
Make – Software build automation tool; one of the earliest build automation tools; many variants
Mix – Build automation software for Elixir
MSBuild – Build automation software; from Microsoft
NAnt; based on Ant
Ninja – Free build automation software

SCons – Software development tool; Python-based
Stack – Haskell development tool
Waf; Python-based


== Meta build ==

Called meta-build tools, these generate configuration files for other build tools such as those listed above.

CMake – Cross-platform build tool for configuring platform-specific builds; very popular; integrated with IDEs such as Qt Creator, KDevelop and GNOME Builder
GNU build system (aka Autotools) – Software build toolset from GNUPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets
GYP (Generate Your Projects) – Build automation tool created by Google; superseded by GN which generates files for ninja and other tools
imake
OpenMake Software Meister
Meson – Build automation tool; integrated with GNOME Builder
Premake – Cross-platform build tool for configuring platform-specific builds; written in Lua
qmake – Software build automation tool


== Continuous integration ==
Continuous integration systems automate build operations at a relatively high level via features including: scheduling and triggering builds, storing build log and output files and integrating with version control systems.

AnthillPro – Continuous integration server
Apache Continuum – Continuous integration server for building Java-based projects; discontinued
Bitbucket Pipelines and Deployments – Continuous integration for Bitbucket hosted repositories
Buildbot – Continuous integration testing framework
CruiseControl – Software continuous build framework
Go continuous delivery – Open source, cross-platform
GitLab Runner – Continuous integration
GitHub Actions – Free continuous integration service for open-source projects
Hudson – Continuous integration tool
Jenkins – Open source automation server; Hudson fork
Spinnaker – Open source multi-cloud continuous delivery service from Netflix and Google
TeamCity – Build management and continuous integration server
