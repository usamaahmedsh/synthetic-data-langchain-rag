The Golden Joystick Awards, also known as the People's Gaming Awards, is a video game award ceremony; it awards the best video games of the year. Although originally solely voted for by the British public, it is now a global event that is voted for online by millions of fans worldwide via GamesRadar+. Launched in 1983, the Golden Joystick Awards is the longest-running and one of the biggest public-voted video game award shows.
The awards were initially focused on computer games, but were extended to include console games. The ceremony is not directly related to the golden joystick prize given away to successful contestants on GamesMaster, a British television show, but both properties belong to Future plc.
