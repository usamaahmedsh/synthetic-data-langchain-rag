== History ==
Founder and CEO Craig "Tooey" Courtemanche started his career as a carpenter and served as a real estate developer, before starting a tech company in Silicon Valley. When building his home in Santa Barbara, Tooey realized that he could apply his technology background in the field of construction. The app he built served to better manage the construction process. Founded in 2002, the company was originally headquartered in Carpinteria, California. Steve Zahm, founder of the e-learning company DigitalThink, joined Procore as president in 2004.
Procore's revenue in 2012 was $4.8 million. In 2020, it was $400 million. The estimated revenue for 2024 is $1 billion.
The company initially filed to go public in 2019, with plans to launch the IPO in 2020, but delayed the offering due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Procore provides end-to-end construction management software for owners, general contractors, and specialty contractors. It has a unified platform with solutions for various phases of work—including preconstruction, project management, workforce management, and financial management—as well as analytics. Procore also connects to third-party integrations through its App Marketplace.
Procore uses AI in its platform. Two of the ways Procore is using AI are through Procore Copilot and Agents. Copilot is a generative AI tool that allows users to retrieve information from and summarize project documents. Procore Agents streamlines processes such as managing RFIs, scheduling, and submittals to automate tasks and reduce manual data entry. These AI tools support workflows across the full project lifecycle.
