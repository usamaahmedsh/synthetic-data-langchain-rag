In mathematics, the Zernike polynomials are a sequence of polynomials that are orthogonal on the unit disk. Named after optical physicist Frits Zernike, laureate of the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physics and the inventor of phase-contrast microscopy, they play important roles in various optics branches such as beam optics and imaging.

Alternatively, one can use the known values of phase function G on the circular grid to form a system of equations. The phase function is retrieved by the unknown-coefficient weighted product with (known values) of Zernike polynomial across the unit grid. Hence, coefficients can also be found by solving a linear system, for instance by matrix inversion. Fast algorithms to calculate the forward and inverse Zernike transform use symmetry properties of trigonometric functions, separability of radial and azimuthal parts of Zernike polynomials, and their rotational symmetries.

 as even numbers are only cases to get non-vanishing Zernike polynomials. (If n is even then l is also even. If n is odd, then l is also odd.)
This property is sometimes used to categorize Zernike polynomials into even and odd polynomials in terms of their angular dependence. (it is also possible to add another category with l = 0 since it has a special property of no angular dependence.)

(This nomenclature is not used in practice because non-vanishing polynomials have even l only combined with even n and
odd l combined with odd n, so angularly even polynomials are also radially even polynomials and angularly odd polynomials are also radially odd polynomials such that the attribute angularly is superflous.)
The radial polynomials are also either even or odd, depending on the order n or the azimuthal index m:

  
    
      
        
          R

    {\displaystyle R_{n}^{m}(\rho )}
  
 with an odd (even) m contains only odd (even) powers to ρ (see examples of

=== Noll's sequential indices ===
Applications often involve linear algebra, where an integral over a product of Zernike polynomials and some other factor builds matrix elements.
To enumerate the rows and columns of these matrices by a single index, a conventional mapping of the two indices n and m to a single index j has been introduced by Noll.
(In this section the 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  
 is the signed upper index of 
  
    
      
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z}
  
 which may be positive or negative or zero.)

The rule is the following.

The even Zernike polynomials Z with 
  
    
      
        m
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m>0}
  
 obtain even indices j.
The odd Z where 
  
    
      
        m
        <
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m<0}
  
 obtain odd indices j.
Within a given n, a lower 
  
    
      
        
          |
          m
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\vert m\right\vert }
  
 results in a lower j.


=== OSA/ANSI standard indices ===
OSA
 and ANSI single-index Zernike polynomials using:

  
    
      
        j
        =
        
          
            
              n
              (
              n
              +
              2

              l

    {\displaystyle j={\frac {n(n+2)+l}{2}}}
  

OSA/ANSI indices can be converted back to standard indices as follows:

  
    
      
        n
        =
        
          ⌊

        j
        −
        n
        (

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=\left\lfloor {\frac {{\sqrt {8j+1}}-1}{2}}\right\rfloor ,\qquad l=2j-n(n+2).}

    {\displaystyle j=\left(1+{\frac {n+|l|}{2}}\right)^{2}-2|l|+\left\lfloor {\frac {1-\operatorname {sgn} l}{2}}\right\rfloor }

        sgn
        ⁡
        l
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {sgn} l}
  
 is the sign or signum function. The first 20 fringe numbers are listed below.


=== Wyant indices ===
James C. Wyant uses the "Fringe" indexing scheme except it starts at 0 instead of 1 (subtract 1). This method is commonly used including interferogram analysis software in Zygo interferometers and the open source software DFTFringe.

== Applications ==

The functions are a basis defined over the circular support area, typically the pupil planes in classical optical imaging at visible and infrared wavelengths through systems of lenses and mirrors of finite diameter. Their advantages are the simple analytical properties inherited from the simplicity of the radial functions and the factorization in radial and azimuthal functions; this leads, for example, to closed-form expressions of the two-dimensional Fourier transform in terms of Bessel functions. Their disadvantage, in particular if high n are involved, is the unequal distribution of nodal lines over the unit disk, which introduces ringing effects near the perimeter

    {\displaystyle \rho \approx 1}
  
, which often leads attempts to define other orthogonal functions over the circular disk.
In precision optical manufacturing, Zernike polynomials are used to characterize higher-order errors observed in interferometric analyses. In wavefront slope sensors like the Shack-Hartmann, Zernike coefficients of the wavefront can be obtained by fitting measured slopes with Zernike polynomial derivatives averaged over the sampling subapertures. 
In optometry and ophthalmology, Zernike polynomials are used to describe wavefront aberrations of the cornea or lens from an ideal spherical shape, which result in refraction errors. They are also commonly used in adaptive optics, where they can be used to characterize atmospheric distortion. Obvious applications for this are IR or visual astronomy and satellite imagery.
Another application of the Zernike polynomials is found in the Extended Nijboer–Zernike theory of diffraction and aberrations.
Zernike polynomials are widely used as basis functions of image moments. Since Zernike polynomials are orthogonal to each other, Zernike moments can represent properties of an image with no redundancy or overlap of information between the moments. Although Zernike moments are significantly dependent on the scaling and the translation of the object in a region of interest (ROI), their magnitudes are independent of the rotation angle of the object. Thus, they can be utilized to extract features from images that describe the shape characteristics of an object. For instance, Zernike moments are utilized as shape descriptors to classify benign and malignant breast masses or the surface of vibrating disks. Zernike Moments also have been used to quantify shape of osteosarcoma cancer cell lines in single cell level. Moreover, Zernike Moments have been used for early detection of Alzheimer's disease by extracting discriminative information from the MR images of Alzheimer's disease, Mild cognitive impairment, and Healthy groups.
