Codeberg e.V. is a German nonprofit organization specialized in open-source software development services.


== Services ==
Codeberg provides an online collaborative software development environment with Forgejo, static page hosting with Codeberg Pages, a collaborative translation web platform with Weblate and CI/CD with Woodpecker CI and Forgejo Actions.
Development of the Gitea-fork Forgejo also takes place on Codeberg.


== History ==
Codeberg e.V. was established in September 2018 with 7 founding members and launched as Codeberg.org in January 2019. The organization selected the European Union for their headquarters and computer infrastructure, due to members' concerns that a software project repository hosted in the United States could be removed if a malicious actor made bad faith copyright claims under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. After one month, the Codeberg e.V. organization had 25 members, and Codeberg.org hosted 333 repositories with 379 users.
In 2022, the Software Freedom Conservancy started its "Give up GitHub"-campaign, which included Codeberg as one of the suggested alternatives. In December 2022, Codeberg launched Forgejo, a soft fork of Gitea, in response to a controversial change in direction of the Gitea Project. In February 2024, the Forgejo project decided to hard fork from Gitea, citing reduced maintenance overhead and stability reasons.
As of November 2025, Codeberg hosts over 300,000 repositories and has more than 200,000 registered user accounts. At the end of November 2025, the Zig programming language announced moving to Codeberg as "GitHub no longer demonstrates commitment to engineering excellence".
