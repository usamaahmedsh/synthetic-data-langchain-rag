This article compares notable text editors. It may not be up-to-date or all-inclusive. Comparisons are between stable versions (not upcoming or beta releases) and are exclusive of any add-ons, extensions or external programs unless otherwise noted.
Other features can be listed via the Category of text editor features. 


== General attributes ==
The following table identifies the following attributes about editors:

Name
Current name of the editor.
Developer
Original author or current maintainer.
Initial release
When was the first release.
Latest release
The version and date of the latest release
Programming language
 Language of the source code used to  build the editor
Cost
Indicates or the cost to buy or use the editor. Values are in USD.
License
 license that governs use of the editor.
GUI
Whether the editor provides a graphical user interface (GUI).
TUI or CLI
Whether the editor provides either a text-based user interface (TUI) or a command-line interface (CLI).


== Operating system support ==
The following table identifies the operating systems that an editor runs on. An editor might run on operating systems that are not listed.

 


== Natural language (localization) ==
The following table identifies the natural languages supported by an editor in its UI.


== Document interface ==
The following table identifies the following attributes of an editor that describe its user experience with respect to multiple documents:

Multiple instances
Whether multiple instances of the program can be open at the same time for editing multiple files; one in each instance. Applies both for single-document interface (SDI) and multiple-document interface (MDI). Also, applies for a program that has a user interface that looks like multiple instances of the same program (such as some versions of  Word).
Single document window splitting
Whether a window can be split to simultaneously view different areas of a file.
MDI overlappable windows
Whether each open document gets its own fully movable window inside the editor environment.
MDI tabbed document interface
Whether multiple documents can be viewed as tabs in a single window.
MDI window splitting
Whether supports splitting the application window to show multiple documents (non-overlapping windows).
 


== Basic features ==
 


== Programming features ==
A text editor that is designed for  programming may be classified as a source code editor. The following table describes an editor's support for the following programming features:

Syntax highlighting
Styles text (such as colors and fonts) according to syntactic rules.
Function list
Lists all functions from current file in a window or sidebar and allows user to jump directly to the definition of that function for example by double-clicking on the function name in the list. More or less realtime (does not require creating a symbol database, see below).
Symbol database
Database of functions, variable and type definitions, macro definitions etc. in all the files belonging to the software being developed. The database can be created by the editor itself or by an external program such as ctags. The database can be used to locate the definition even if it is in another file.
Bracket matching
Find matching start/end delimiters; taking into account nesting.
Auto indentation
May refer to just simple indenting to the same level as the line above, or intelligent indenting that is language specific, e.g., ensuring a given indent style.
 Auto completion
Suggesting the completion of a partially entered word such as a keyword or identifier
Code folding
Selectively show/hide blocks of code
Text folding
Selectively show/hide text on boundaries such as a paragraph or a section
Compiler integration
Allows running compilers/linkers/debuggers from within editor, capturing the compiler output and stepping through errors, automatically moving cursor to corresponding location in the source file.


== Additional programming features ==
This section identifies support for the following programming features:

CLI shell integration
Whether the editor integrates with a command-line interface (CLI) shell.
GUI shell integration
Whether the editor integrates with a graphical user interface (GUI) shell.
Macro language
Whether the editor supports a macro language for automation.
Collaborative editing
Whether the editor supports collaborative real-time editing.
Large file support
Most text editors do not support large text files. Some restrict themselves to available in-core RAM while others use sophisticated virtual memory management techniques and paging algorithms.

Long line support
Whether the editor supports long lines
Multi-line regex support
Whether the editor supports multi-line regex matching (e.g. "\n\n(.+)\n\n").
Search in files
Perform search and possibly replace in multiple files in the file system; for example on a sub-directory and recursively all the directories below it; like grep.


== Key bindings ==
The following table describes an editor's support for key binding configuration; both custom key bindings and presets as defined by a platform or other editor.

Notes:

Vim
Custom maps of Ctrl-1 .. Ctrl-9, Ctrl-0 cannot be set, nor is Control-Shift-<char> distinguished from Ctrl-<char>.
Notepad++
Custom shortcuts of Shift-<char> cannot be set, they need an added modifier such as Ctrl or Alt. i.e. SCI_LINESCROLLUP cannot be bound to "Shift-I"as the "Add"button is greyed out.
Pico
Pico uses most of Emacs's motion and deletion commands: ^F ^B ^P ^N ^D etc.


== Protocol support ==
Support for editing files over noteable network protocols.


== Character encoding support ==
The following table identifies notable character encodings that an editor supports – can load, save, view and edit text in the encoding without changing any characters. Partial implies that the editor can only convert the character encoding to internal (8-bit) format for editing, some encodings are supported only in some platforms or the editor can only display a character set (such as OEM) by loading corresponding font, but does not support keyboard entry for that character set.


== Right-to-left and bidirectional text ==
Support for right-to-left (RTL) text is necessary for editing some languages like Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, and Yiddish and the mixture of left-to-right (LTR) and RTL known as bidirectional (BiDi). The following table indicates whether an editor supports RTL and BiDi text. Some editors (e.g. Notepad++ 5.1.3) can render bidirectional text but does not support editing it.


== Newline support ==
The following table identifies newline support of editors. The three options are:

CR/LF
Generally, used on Windows.
LF
Generally, used on Unix-like systems (including macOS).
CR
Generally, used on Classic Mac OS.
