== Reception ==
99% Invisible's Roman Mars described The Memory Palace as "sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes hysterical, and often a wonderful mix of both."
The A.V. Club called The Memory Palace a "brisk and sadly infrequent podcast" whose episodes feature "a kind of precious, deadpan delivery similar to This American Life, but more humorous, backed by a surprisingly evocative and effective musical score."
Boing Boing's David Pescovitz called The Memory Palace "terrific," "excellent," and "one of my favorite podcasts." While guest blogging for Boing Boing, Douglas Rushkoff described The Memory Palace as "highly textured historical narratives about stuff we might not know or remember." Boing Boing's Mark Frauenfelder called The Memory Palace one of his "favorite podcasts of 2012" comparing it to Paul Harvey's radio program The Rest of the Story.
