ABS-CBN is a Philippine media and content company. It serves as the flagship media brand of ABS-CBN Corporation, a subsidiary of Lopez Holdings Corporation. Formerly the Philippines' largest free-to-air television network, ABS-CBN has since evolved into a multi-platform content producer and distributor following the expiration and non-renewal of its broadcast franchise in 2020. The company currently syndicates its programming across various platforms, including partner networks, cable channels, streaming services, and digital platforms.
ABS-CBN is the oldest television broadcaster in Southeast Asia, with origins dating back to the early 1950s. It was the first network in the region to broadcast in color and is historically among the oldest commercial television broadcasters in Asia. In 2015, ABS-CBN transitioned to high-definition (HD) broadcasting ahead of most Philippine networks, and by 2020, after it stopped broadcasting on free-to-air television following a cease and desist order from the National Telecommunications Commission, it had fully shifted to digital operations. ABS-CBN is colloquially referred to as the "Kapamilya Network," a branding introduced in 1999 and officially launched in 2003 during its 50th anniversary, and one that remains widely used up to this day. The red, green, and blue heart emojis in any order are used to represent the network online even before the shutdown of its free-to-air TV operations.
ABS-CBN is headquartered at the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center in Quezon City, with its main operations based in the ELJ Communications Center, which houses its corporate offices and production studios. The network is metonymically referred to as "Ignacia," a nod to its headquarters located along Mother Ignacia Street in Quezon City. The company also operates a state-of-the-art secondary production hub at the Horizon IT Park in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. This facility is used for the production of television programs and films.
In February 2025, the company sold a portion of its Quezon City property, including the decommissioned Millennium Transmitter site (which was closed on July 9, 2025), to Ayala Land for mixed-use redevelopment  and will take effect in December 2026. ABS-CBN retained ownership of the ELJ Communications Center, which remains its main headquarters, and plans to fully consolidate all corporate, production, and studio operations within the complex by July 2026. On August 20, 2025, ABS-CBN and Ayala Land have signed the deeds of absolute sale for the purchase of the sold properties.
Since 2020, ABS-CBN has remained active as a primary content provider managed by the company and its subsidiaries, which continue to hold its trademark and copyrights. The organization shifted its focus to content production and distribution for cable, digital, and international audiences. Its global presence is maintained through various direct-to-consumer services and international distribution. ABS-CBN also delivers content through broadcast partnerships with local networks, which now utilize its former frequencies and transmission facilities. By 2024, ABS-CBN had adopted a diversified revenue model centered on digital platforms, international licensing, and media partnerships, resulting in improved financial performance. In the first quarter of 2025, ABS-CBN generated ₱4.23 billion in consolidated revenue but posted a net loss of ₱425.65 million, nearly halving its losses from the previous year as its content production and distribution business showed continued growth. The company has also set its sights on returning to profitability by 2026.
In June 2025, ABS-CBN officially announced it would no longer pursue a congressional franchise to return to traditional broadcasting. Instead, ABS-CBN will focus on producing compelling content, forming strategic partnerships with local and international broadcasters, and expanding its global reach. CEO Carlo L. Katigbak emphasized the company's shift toward becoming a global storyteller, preparing for a future where television is no longer the center of Philippine entertainment, and content must compete in a borderless, digital-first environment.
On December 4, 2025, Kapamilya shows in ABS-CBN simulcast on TV5 will end on January 2, 2026 and then after 5 years of ABS-CBN Shutdown. After 5 years of ABS-CBN Shows simulcast on TV5 since 2021. No longer continue as ABS-CBN Shows simulcast on TV5 will final on January 2, 2026.


== History ==


=== As a free-to-air television channel (1953–1972; 1986–2020) ===
Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC) was founded on June 13, 1946. It was established by James Lindenberg, one of the founding fathers of Philippine television and an American electronics engineer who went into radio equipment assembly and radio broadcasting. In 1949, James Lindenberg shifted Bolinao to radio broadcasting with DZBC and planned the introduction of television to the Philippines in 1953.

In 1951, Lindenberg partnered with Antonio Quirino, brother of then-Philippine president Elpidio Quirino, to try television broadcasting. In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System or ABS (with Alto Sales Corporation as its corporate name). Alto was a contraction of Quirino and his wife's first names, Tony and Aleli. Despite little money and resources, ABS was able to put up its TV tower by July 1953 and imported around 300 television sets. The initial test broadcasts began in September of the same year. The first full-blown broadcast was on October 23, 1953, at a party in Quirino's home. The first program to air was a garden party at the Quirino residence in Sitio Alto, San Juan. After the premiere telecast, the station followed a daily four-hour schedule from 6:00 to 10:00 PM.

ABS-CBN's first television broadcast was on October 23, 1953, as Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) on DZAQ-TV, three months after the first broadcast of Japan's NHK General TV and Nippon Television. It is the first television network in Southeast Asia to broadcast in color, the first television network in the Philippines to formally launch a digital terrestrial television service, and the first broadcast television network in the Philippines to formally launch in HD.
The flagship television station of ABS-CBN was DWWX-TV (ABS-CBN TV-2 Manila). As such, the network was informally referred to as "Channel 2" or "dos" (Spanish for two) even if the network was seen in other channel numbers elsewhere in the country. The network operated across the Philippine archipelago through the ABS-CBN Regional division which controlled 80 television stations. Its programs are also available outside the Philippines through the global subscription television channel The Filipino Channel (TFC). From 2011 to 2020, the network had on test broadcast for digital terrestrial television using the Japanese standard ISDB-T in select areas in the Philippines. On October 3, 2015, ABS-CBN started to broadcast in high-definition quality through its affiliate direct-to-home cable and satellite television providers.
As of May 5, 2020, all terrestrial broadcast operations have halted completely as per a cease-and desist order from the National Telecommunications Commission. All frequencies formerly assigned to ABS-CBN have since been reassigned to other networks (including AMBS' All TV, which ironically, would begin simulcasting selected ABS-CBN programs nearly two years later).


=== As a content producer and distributor (2020–present) ===
ABS-CBN restructured its operations starting 2020, prioritizing and focusing content creation, digital distribution, and global partnerships across cable, satellite, and over-the-top (OTT) platforms. These operations are managed by ABS-CBN under its parent company, ABS-CBN Corporation.
On June 13, 2020, ABS-CBN launched the Kapamilya Channel, a 24-hour pay television network designed to continue the company's programming through alternative platforms. Serving as the flagship channel of the company, the channel was introduced with a high-definition (HD) feed, replacing the former ABS-CBN HD channel, which originally launched on October 3, 2015. It is available nationwide via major cable and satellite providers, including Streamtech's Planet Cable, Converge ICT's Vision and its sister company Sky Cable.
Following the introduction of its cable channel, the company launched Kapamilya Online Live on August 1, 2020, as its flagship free livestreaming service on YouTube and Facebook. The platform features current programming, same-day broadcasts, and archived content, mirroring the shows aired on its cable counterpart with slight variations due to copyright restrictions. It marked the country's first full-day digital entertainment service by a major television network, offering continuous programming through social media livestreams.
ABS-CBN merged its streaming services iWant and TFC Online in 2021 to launch the upgraded iWantTFC platform, integrating domestic and international content libraries into a single streaming service. The platform offers live channels, video-on-demand, and exclusive digital content. iWant relaunch on July 10, 2025, with enhanced features including support for 4K streaming, aiming to provide a sleeker and improved viewing experience.
ABS-CBN expanded its domestic television presence through a series of blocktime agreements with multiple broadcast networks. Programming became available on A2Z Channel 11 through a partnership with ZOE Broadcasting Network, followed by a similar arrangement with TV5, which began airing select ABS-CBN shows and later included its primetime lineup. A separate content deal with Advanced Media Broadcasting System allowed ABS-CBN to air current and archived programs on All TV starting in May 2024. The company also launched collaborative projects with GMA Network, featuring shared production and on-air crossovers, marking a notable shift in the historically competitive landscape of Philippine television. On May 29, 2025, at 8:00 PM, Media Serbisyo Production Corporation a joint venture with Prime Media Holdings officially relaunched the DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 and DZMM TeleRadyo brands, resuming 24-hour news and public service broadcasts on AM radio and television. Concurrently, ABS-CBN strengthened its digital distribution by partnering with international streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Viu, iQIYI, and WeTV iflix.


== Branding ==
The ABS-CBN logo features three main elements: the vertical line rooted in a horizontal origin, the three extending circles, and the text ABS-CBN, forming the spinning top (trumpo in Filipino) shape.
ABS-CBN's logo also has a horizontal version, usually used to save space as the main vertical logo usually takes up more space. The design of the horizontal version of the logo contains the ABS-CBN text, split into two parts, "ABS" and "CBN", without the dash connecting them, and ABS-CBN's symbol squeezed in between them.
The first logo to have a horizontal version going by this design was the logo launched in 1986. From September 14, 1986, up until the final sign-off of the main ABS-CBN terrestrial network on May 5, 2020, the elements of the horizontal logo, text, and symbol were evenly sized. Since 2004, starting with the logo of ABS-CBN Store from 2004 to 2014, the horizontal logo has been slightly larger than the Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) and Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) names.


=== Slogans ===
The Philippines' Largest Network (1967–1972; 1986–1988) – Emphasized national coverage and prominence during its early broadcast years. The network's trademark jingle was created based on this slogan, which is still being used to present day.
The Star Network (1987–1992) – Highlighted the network's popular entertainment stars and notable programming after resuming operations in 1986.
In the Service of the Filipino (1989–present) – Reflected the network's dedication to public service, news journalism, and national development.
In the Service of the Filipino Worldwide (1992–present) – Expanded its identity to resonate with overseas Filipino communities and underline its global presence.


=== Seasonal IDs ===
ABS-CBN is widely recognized for its annual Christmas Station ID (CSID) and Summer Station ID (SSID) campaigns. These musical productions have become a significant part of Filipino pop culture and serve as a yearly tradition to promote unity, gratitude, and national pride.


==== Christmas Station IDs ====
ABS-CBN's Christmas Station IDs and their associated theme and song are aired annually across ABS-CBN platforms from November of the current year to January of the next one. The trend began on November 17, 2002, a month after GMA Network rebranded from Rainbow to Kapuso Network on October 27 changing from 1998 to the current 2002 logo.
Each campaign features a new original theme song, celebrity appearances, and stories highlighting Filipino values such as family, resilience, and bayanihan.


==== Summer ID ====
ABS-CBN's Summer IDs, usually released on March, April, or May, reflect themes of joy, fun, and Filipino spirit.
These are often paired with upbeat songs, scenic visuals, and Kapamilya stars celebrating summer with the audience.

Collectively, these channels reinforce ABS-CBN's status as the dominant Philippine media group on YouTube.
Several episodes of FPJ's Batang Quiapo and Senior High have trended at #1 on YouTube Philippines. The two-hour finale of FPJ's Ang Probinsyano recorded 536,543 live concurrent views on Kapamilya Online Live, setting an all-time high at the time. That record was later broken by FPJ's Batang Quiapo, which reached over 1 million concurrent viewers in February 2025, setting a new record for Philippine and Southeast Asian YouTube livestreams. On the same day, Incognito achieved an all-time high for an ABS-CBN drama pilot with over 508,000 concurrent viewers on its livestream debut. The big night of Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Collab Edition also posted strong online engagement, with its finale episode amassing more than 850,000 views on YouTube. Other shows like Can't Buy Me Love, and Senior High have also surpassed hundreds of thousands of concurrent viewers during their peak livestreams.
The success of ABS-CBN's homegrown P-pop group BINI has also contributed to its digital growth. The group's official music videos and performance content, uploaded through Star Music, regularly reach multi‑million viewership. As of mid‑2025, several of BINI's music videos, such as “Pantropiko” and “Salamin, Salamin,” have achieved significant milestones, with over 110 million views and 87 million views respectively.
In addition, ABS-CBN's annual Christmas Station IDs have collectively accumulated tens of millions of views on YouTube. Iconic releases such as Star ng Pasko (2009), Just Love Ngayong Christmas (2017), Ikaw ang Liwanag at Ligaya (2020), and Tayo ang Ligaya ng Isa’t Isa (2022) each continue to attract significant viewership year after year, with some titles exceeding 70 million total views.
On November 29, 2025, the channel was terminated along with It's Showtime following an attempted hacking to promote Bitcoin scam via live stream. Because of the incident, Kapamilya Online Live temporarily livestreamed through the iWant YouTube channel. The main channel was restored on December 1, 2025.


=== Netflix ===
ABS-CBN has emerged as a major content partner on Netflix, significantly boosting the reach of its content among both local and international audiences. After it became a content provider on Netflix, the first ABS-CBN television series to be featured was Ang Sa Iyo Ay Akin, which premiered as The Law of Revenge in August 2021, while the first ABS-CBN feature film to appear on the platform was Exes Baggage, released as part of a batch of Star Cinema titles in October 2020. Since then, multiple ABS-CBN dramas and movies have consistently secured the #1 position on Netflix Philippines charts during their debut weeks, reflecting strong local and diaspora engagement. The partnership has expanded to include a variety of notable dramas, variety shows, and Star Cinema films, many of which have achieved top rankings among Filipino viewers on the service.
Notable ABS-CBN releases that have reached #1 on Netflix Philippines include Incognito, the action-thriller that premiered on January 17, 2025 and immediately claimed the top spot in Netflix PH's TV chart; Sosyal Climbers, ABS-CBN Studios’ first Netflix film collaboration, which debuted on February 27, 2025 and ranked #1 among movies in the Philippines; Hello, Love, Again, the Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards rom-com that premiered on Netflix on February 13, 2025 and topped the Netflix PH movie chart; A Family Affair, the popular drama that immediately became the #1 TV show on Netflix Philippines upon its streaming release in 2022; 2 Good 2 Be True, the KathNiel series that became the most-watched TV series on Netflix PH during its pilot week in May 2022; and Ang sa Iyo ay Akin, the 2020 melodrama that soared to #1 on Netflix Philippines upon its 2021 release.
In addition to new titles, ABS-CBN's collaboration with Netflix also includes classic and restored Filipino films from the ABS-CBN Film Restoration project, ensuring Filipino stories remain accessible and relevant to global viewers.


=== Spotify ===
ABS-CBN's record label, Star Music, began distributing its catalog on Spotify in 2014 as part of the company's digital expansion strategy. On September 22, 2022, ABS-CBN officially launched its presence on Spotify with the ABS-CBN Hub, the country's first local network podcast hub on the platform. This portal centralized all Kapamilya podcasts including Dear MOR: The Podcast,ANC Podcast, and Kapamilya Chat making them accessible to Spotify's global audience.
BINI, the nation's premier P-pop girl group under Star Music, achieved several record-breaking milestones on the platform. In March 2025, the group reached 1 billion all-time Spotify streams, and surpassed 6 million monthly listeners by mid-year, cementing their position as the most-streamed female OPM act and P-pop group on Spotify. Their viral single Pantropiko became the first song by a Filipino girl group to surpass 100 million Spotify streams by July 2024, further expanding their audience and online influence. Earlier in March 2024, BINI also made history as the first Filipino pop group to top Spotify Philippines’ Daily Top Artists chart.
MAKI, another rising Star Music artist, has gained significant traction on Spotify as well. By mid-2025, his hits including Saan? and Dilaw regularly appeared in the platform's Daily Top Songs chart for the Philippines, and his total streams exceeded 100 million. The strong Spotify presence of BINI and MAKI underscores ABS-CBN's evolving approach to music promotion and the growing influence of Filipino artists in the global streaming era.


=== Other social media ===
ABS-CBN's digital presence, managed by ABS-CBN Digital Media, is among the most influential in the Philippines and the region. ABS‑CBN's main Facebook page currently has around 44 million followers, making it the most followed Philippine media company on the platform. It streams regular programs and special events, often alongside YouTube broadcasts, and engages audiences through emoji reactions, live comments, and real-time polls. Exclusive content such as trailers, reels, and behind-the-scenes videos also draw millions of interactions.
The official ABS‑CBN account on X has approximately 1.9 million followers, also the highest among Philippine media companies, offering updates, show highlights, and network announcements.

== Program acquisition and international distribution ==


=== International content syndication ===
ABS-CBN distributes selected drama series, documentaries, and films to regional and international broadcasters, with many titles dubbed or subtitled for audiences across Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Several Kapamilya teleseryes have gained international traction; for example, Got to Believe, The Legal Wife, and Bridges of Love became popular in Thailand, while Pangako Sa 'Yo was the first Filipino drama to air in Kenya and Tanzania, earning strong ratings. The company has sold over 50,000 hours of content to more than 50 countries. Titles like Mula sa Puso, Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas, Marina, Lobo, Super Inggo, Tayong Dalawa, and Bridges of Love have aired in regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Peru.
In Latin America, dramas such as Dahil May Isang Ikaw, The Legal Wife, Pangako Sa 'Yo, and Forevermore were dubbed in Spanish and shown in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. Bridges of Love aired as Puentes de Amor on Argentina's Telefe, marking the first time a Filipino series was broadcast by a major Latin American network. More recent titles like Dahil May Isang Ikaw (Destined Hearts), Kadenang Ginto, and A Love to Last continued this momentum.
In Africa, a distribution deal with StarTimes enabled the broadcast of Filipino series in over 30 Sub-Saharan countries. Dramas including Ang Probinsyano (Brothers), Kadenang Ginto (The Heiress), and A Soldier's Heart were dubbed in Swahili, Hausa, and French. Bagong Umaga aired in 41 countries, and titles like Asintado reached French-speaking territories such as Côte d'Ivoire and La Réunion. Content was also offered via regional streaming platforms in Egypt and Nigeria.
In Asia, ABS-CBN expanded through syndication and format licensing. In Indonesia, the 2015 remake of Pangako Sa 'Yo aired as Janjiku on MNCTV, followed by the Bahasa-dubbed broadcast of The Iron Heart on ANTV in 2023. In Malaysia, ABS-CBN made its free-to-air debut in 2022 via TVS 122, airing primetime dramas with Bahasa Malaysia subtitles.
In Turkey, ABS-CBN dramas such as The Legal Wife (aired as Kocamı Affet), Bridges of Love, and Forevermore were dubbed in Turkish and broadcast on local networks specializing in international dramas. An English-dubbed version of Darna was also released via StarTimes in Africa following its Indonesian run.
ABS-CBN is a founding member of the Smart Alliance, a regional consortium formed in 2009 alongside Mediacorp, Media Prima, BBTV, and MNC that promotes collaboration in content sharing, co-productions, and digital media innovation.


=== International adaptations and licensed formats ===
In addition to syndicating finished content, ABS-CBN has licensed several of its drama series and program formats for remake in foreign markets. The most notable example is the 2000s hit Pangako Sa 'Yo, which was adapted in Indonesia in 2014 as Janji Hati by RCTI, starring Aliando Syarief and Michelle Ziudith. Other series such as Sana Maulit Muli and Mara Clara inspired Indonesian remakes, including Cinta Satu Malam and Putri Yang Ditukar, respectively.
In 2022, the drama Hanggang Saan became the first ABS-CBN scripted series to be officially adapted in Turkey, premiering on Kanal D as A Mother's Guilt.
More recently, Love Thy Woman entered development for an Indonesian remake, reflecting the network's continued expansion into international format licensing.
ABS-CBN has also exported unscripted and variety formats. Notably, the noontime variety show It's Showtime was franchised in Indonesia as It's Showtime Indonesia, which premiered on MNCTV in 2019 and ran until May 2020. The localized version featured both Indonesian hosts and Filipino guest performers, adapting core segments for Indonesian audiences while preserving the essence of the original format.


=== International content acquisitions ===
ABS-CBN's International Acquisitions team is responsible for sourcing, licensing, and acquiring foreign content to enhance the network's programming lineup for both Philippine and international audiences. This division operates under the International Sales & Distribution unit and negotiates with global studios, distributors, and content owners across Asia, the Americas, Europe, and beyond.
A landmark acquisition was the Taiwanese drama Meteor Garden, which aired in 2003 and became the Philippines’ first "Asianovela." Its phenomenal popularity marked a turning point in local programming, sparking a nationwide craze and paving the way for the Asian drama phenomenon on Philippine television. Following Meteor Garden, ABS-CBN continued to import top Asian dramas such as Boys Over Flowers, Princess Hours, Dream High, Lovers in Paris, The Kitchen Musical, and Goblin; as well as Latin American telenovelas including María Mercedes, Rosalinda, and Rubí; along with Western series such as Alias, The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed, Mr. Bean and Liar. In the 2020s, responding to the increasing popularity of Thai content among Filipino viewers, ABS-CBN expanded its acquisitions to include not only 2gether: The Series but also a growing slate of acclaimed Thai BL dramas and youth-oriented series, further diversifying its international programming and reflecting shifting viewing preferences in the Philippines.
ABS-CBN has also been renowned for acquiring and popularizing iconic anime and children's programs. Anime classics such as Judy Abbott, Princess Sarah, Cedie, Heidi, and Marcelino Pan y Vino became household favorites, capturing the hearts of Filipino children and families across generations. The network also introduced beloved anime and animated titles including Hana Yori Dango, Cardcaptor Sakura, Fruits Basket, Naruto, Akazukin Chacha, Wedding Peach, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Digimon, Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies (from RPN), Tom and Jerry (from IBC), Scooby-Doo, Oddbods and The Simpsons. The network further diversified its lineup for younger audiences by airing international preschool shows such as Postman Pat, Bear in the Big Blue House, Peppa Pig and Bob the Builder.
ABS-CBN also played a key role in popularizing tokusatsu, or Japanese live-action special effects series, in the Philippines. Notable titles broadcast by the network include the various titles on the Super Sentai franchises, Ultraman Ace, Chōdenshi Bioman, and Kamen Rider Agito all of which introduced Filipino audiences to the world of transforming superheroes and team-based action.


=== Local adaptations of acquired international formats ===
ABS-CBN has a long-standing tradition of producing local adaptations of popular international television formats, further cementing its reputation as a leader in Philippine entertainment. By acquiring rights to globally recognized shows and drama series, ABS-CBN has brought international concepts closer to Filipino audiences through culturally relevant remakes, localized narratives, and the use of homegrown talent.
One of the earliest and most notable examples is the adaptation of Asian dramas, following the immense success of Asianovelas in the early 2000s. ABS-CBN produced Filipino remakes of beloved series such as My Girl, Only You, Lovers in Paris, and It's Okay to Not Be Okay, blending original storylines with uniquely Filipino elements and settings.
Another significant adaptation is the Japanese drama Saving Grace, which was localized for Filipino audiences, reflecting the network's continued interest in bringing diverse Asian narratives to the Philippine market.
The network has also successfully adapted drama formats from Western television, such as May Bukas Pa and The Broken Marriage Vow are the Philippine adaptations of the 1955 Spanish film Marcelino Pan y Vino and acclaimed British series Doctor Foster, respectively. Another high-profile project was I Love Betty La Fea, the Filipino version of the hit Colombian telenovela Yo soy Betty, la fea, which was localized with a Filipino cast and became a major primetime success.
In addition, ABS-CBN has adapted numerous reality, game, and talent show formats, bringing international television experiences into Filipino homes. Notable examples include Pinoy Big Brother, Pilipinas Got Talent, The Voice of the Philippines, Kapamilya Deal or No Deal, The X Factor Philippines, Idol Philippines, Pinoy Fear Factor, Junior MasterChef Pinoy Edition, The Price Is Right, Minute to Win It, Your Face Sounds Familiar, I Can See Your Voice, and Wheel of Fortune.


== Competition ==
In 1992, AGB Nielsen Philippines was founded. In 2007, TNS Philippines started to offer media research through Kantar Media Philippines (formerly Kantar/TNS). In 2008, AGB Nielsen Philippines released the list of all-time highest rating shows in the Philippines, with 7 of the top 10 highest rating shows all from ABS-CBN with the shows like The Battle: Pacquiao vs. Morales, Rosalinda, Esperanza, Meteor Garden, Pangako Sa 'Yo, Miss Universe 1994, and María Mercedes.


== Technology ==
ABS-CBN has long been recognized as a trailblazer in Philippine media, consistently leading the industry in technological innovation. The company has pioneered numerous firsts in broadcast, production, and digital distribution, from early adoption of color television and satellite broadcasting to the current integration of advanced cloud and digital platforms. These ongoing investments have enabled ABS-CBN to set new standards for content quality, audience reach, and operational efficiency in the region.


=== Cloud-Based and IP Delivery ===
In early February 2021, ABS-CBN migrated to the Amagi cloud platform, enabling unified, cloud-based live playout across all its digital and broadcast services. This modern infrastructure allows for real-time, scalable, and cost-efficient transmission of both linear channels and video-on-demand (VOD) content across multiple regions, including Asia-Pacific, North America, the Middle East, and Europe. The transition to IP-based delivery, facilitated through partnerships with cloud video infrastructure providers such as Amagi, highlights ABS-CBN's continued evolution into a digital first content company.
The same cloud infrastructure supports the cable broadcast of Kapamilya Channel, live streaming of Kapamilya Online Live, and powers the upgraded iWant platform, as well as all international feeds of TFC and its global companion channels, as well as local cable channels under Creative Programs, Inc.. For security and user access management, ABS-CBN utilizes Synacor's Cloud ID system across its international streaming services to ensure secure and unified authentication across regions.
Editing and content preparation are handled through non-linear editing systems such as Etere, which has been integrated into ABS-CBN's digital production workflow since the late 2000s. Additionally, the Dalet Galaxy platform is used within ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs to streamline newsroom asset management, editing, and playout. These systems collectively support both traditional broadcast and digital-first production pipelines.


=== Satellite distribution ===
Although IP-based transmission is now the network's primary standard, ABS-CBN continues to maintain satellite distribution to ensure redundancy, support underserved regions, and accommodate legacy platforms still reliant on traditional infrastructure. The company uses Intelsat 19 at 166.0° East to provide coverage across the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, Australia, Guam, and the Pacific Islands. These satellite feeds are also utilized by regional affiliates and cable operators in areas with limited internet connectivity.
Although ABS-CBN no longer holds a Philippine broadcast franchise, its satellite operations remain unaffected, as they do not involve direct terrestrial transmission to the public. Instead, ABS-CBN delivers content to authorized third-party platforms, such as cable providers, direct-to-home (DTH) satellite services, and international carriers, which handle the end-user distribution under their own licenses and permits.
Under the leadership of CEO Carlo Katigbak, ABS-CBN has accelerated its digital transformation, embracing IP-based workflows, virtual production, and AI-powered content management systems. These technologies have allowed the network to seamlessly transition into a multi-platform distributor, engaging millions of viewers across streaming services, mobile apps, and social media. This continuous drive for innovation is supported by active research and global partnerships, cementing ABS-CBN's reputation as a leader in Southeast Asia's evolving media landscape.


== Controversies and scandals ==
Throughout the years, ABS-CBN has been involved in several controversies and scandals involving its talents, employees, and programs.


=== 2004 copyright infringement with GMA ===
On July 22, 2004, during the arrival of Angelo de la Cruz (a truck driver who was held hostage and threatened with beheading in Iraq abducted by armed rebels west of Baghdad while trucking fuel from Saudi Arabia) at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, live breaking news coverage was aired on GMA Network and other television stations in the Philippines. GMA Network used audio-video coverage from Reuters, which the network was subscribed to. During the broadcast, a live feed from Reuters was simultaneously aired with its own live broadcast. During the first five seconds of the live feed, GMA Network noticed that the live feed from Reuters was also airing from its main competitor ABS-CBN. The live video was restricted only to ABS-CBN and Reuters did not inform GMA Network that the video coverage was only intended for ABS-CBN. The local Court of Appeals declined the case filed by ABS-CBN Corporation against GMA Network Inc. for allegations of illegal duplication of its live video footage. In a ruling, the local fourth division of the appellate court set aside the resolution of the local Justice Department, which approved the filing of the violation of Republic Act 8293 (or the Intellectual Property Code) against GMA Network. It ruled out that the act of GMA Network airing the live video coverage was focused on good faith since there was no intent to instigate damage to ABS-CBN. The local court also said GMA Network acted in good faith when it immediately stopped using the live video feed from Reuters upon learning ABS-CBN was also covering the event and its following exertion to authenticate the ABS-CBN Corporation restriction arrangement with the news service, Reuters. The court also stressed that apart from the lack of intent of GMA Network to affect the video from ABS-CBN, the action did not contravene Sections 212.4 and 185.1 of Republic Act 8293 since it was a short excerpt.


=== Wowowee scandals and incidents ===

Two major incidents involving ABS-CBN have involved the network's variety show Wowowee. The first incident was a demand for tickets to a one-year anniversary episode of the show at the PhilSports Arena in 2006 caused a deadly crowd crush killing 76 people. Over a year later in August 2007, the show became entrenched in another scandal involving the possibility of a new game on the show being rigged as evident by a "mechanical glitch" which occurred during an episode, which grew greater after Eat Bulaga! host Joey de Leon and Wowowee host Willie Revillame started exchanging attacks on-air against each other during their respective and competing shows. The incident later led to a probe by the Department of Trade and Industry led by senator Mar Roxas (which was jokingly suggested by Joey during a speech he made on Eat Bulaga! in reference to the Hello Garci scandal, dubbing it "Hello Pappy").


=== AGB Nielsen TV ratings scandal ===

In late 2007, ABS-CBN and GMA Network accused AGB Nielsen Philippines of tampering with the ratings during their 2007 ratings surveys.


=== ABS-CBN vs. Willing Willie copyright case ===
ABS-CBN demanded ₱127 million from their former reality show star, Willie Revillame, citing copyright infringement due to stark similarities in Revillame's show, Willing Willie on TV5, and ABS-CBN's Wowowee. ABS-CBN listed five acts of plagiarism allegedly committed by Willing Willie in their complaint as follows:

Willing Willie's opening song and dance number was similar to that of Wowowee.
"BIGA-Ten" and "Big Time Ka", both segments from the shows involved, bear similar names.
"Willie of Fortune" and "Willtime Bigtime" are segments from both shows which resemble each other. ABS-CBN claimed that "Willtime Bigtime" resembled its show as it also showcases contestants relaying their personal stories before proceeding to play a singing/trivia game.
April "Congratulations" Gustilo was one of several backup dancers from Wowowee who also appear in 'Willing Willie'.
Other striking similarities ABS-CBN claimed are found in Willing Willie's set design, stage, studio viewers' seats lay-out, lighting angles and camera angles.
A 25-page ruling dated May 22, 2015, dismissed the case against Revillame. After the Quezon City RTC demanded a ₱400 million bond from Revillame to answer any further damage the network might sustain, the fee was waived.


=== 2020 franchise renewal controversy ===

Since April 2017, ABS-CBN was attacked by former president Rodrigo Duterte, as the network refused to air his 2016 presidential campaign ads in favor of a smear ad paid for by-then vice presidential candidate Antonio Trillanes. However, according to the country's Commission on Elections spokesperson James Jimenez, the controversial ad was within election law, under "Partisan Political Activity". Duterte publicly stated that he would oppose the 25-year franchise renewal of ABS-CBN, and former Laguna governor E.R. Ejercito supported his plan. Opposition lawmakers as well as labor groups objected to Duterte's stance on ABS-CBN, as the franchise's non-renewal would compromise the employees of the network; stating that the blocking of the franchise renewal had no merit. Opposition groups also claimed that the non-renewal of the franchise violates press freedom.
Under Philippine law, broadcasting networks require a congressional franchise (Republic Act) to operate television and radio stations for 25 years; the absence of one will lead to the suspension of its operations. ABS-CBN's legislative franchise, which was approved by the virtue of Republic Act No. 7966 (granted last March 30, 1995), was scheduled to expire on May 4, 2020, because the franchise would become effective fifteen days after its publication on the Official Gazette on April 19, 1995. At least 12 lawmakers have filed their own versions for a new franchise of the network. House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano assured that Congress will tackle the franchise with fairness.
On February 24, 2020, the CEO of the network apologized to Duterte for not airing his political advertisements during his 2016 polls, which Duterte accepted, and Congress made its decision to investigate their franchise renewal.
During a Senate hearing on the same day, public services panel chair Grace Poe stated they were to investigate ABS-CBN's compliance with the terms and conditions of its franchise. The Senate concluded that there was no breach of laws or franchise terms.

On May 5, 2020, the National Telecommunications Commission issued a cease and desist order to stop the network's broadcast, including its radio stations DZMM and MOR, following the expiration of its broadcast franchise the day before. The cease and desist order covers 42 television stations operated by ABS-CBN across the country, including Channel 2, 10 digital broadcast channels, 18 FM stations, and 5 AM stations.
The network subsequently signed off following TV Patrol. Along with the order, NTC wanted to recall ABS-CBN's assigned frequencies. ABS-CBN explained that it would not be in public interest to have the frequencies recalled, as this would hinder their ability to immediately restart broadcasts in the event a new franchise was granted. Additionally, there were fresh measures in the Congress to grant provisional franchise, which later rolled into a series of hearings to grant a fresh 25-year franchise. NTC was told to refrain from carrying out the recall by the Congress. On July 10, 2020, members of the House of Representatives, voted 70–11 to deny ABS-CBN's renewal franchise application, citing several issues on the network's prior 25-year franchise. According to a survey released by the Social Weather Stations following the rejection of the network's franchise renewal, 75% of Filipinos want the network back.
In January 2025, Albay Representative Joey Salceda filed House Bill 11252, the fifth bill that seeks to grant ABS-CBN's television and radio broadcasting franchise for another 25 years.


== Reception ==
Channels and programs of ABS-CBN have been recognized by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences giving several accolades in different categories, primarily the International Emmy Awards, although none of them won a single award.
