== History ==


=== Founding years ===
Datadog was founded in New York City in 2010 by Olivier Pomel and Alexis Lê-Quôc, who met while undergraduates at Ecole Centrale Paris, and later worked together for 9 years at Wireless Generation. After Wireless Generation was acquired by NewsCorp, the two set out to create a product that would reduce the friction they experienced between developer and systems administration teams, who were often working at cross-purposes.
They built Datadog to be a cloud infrastructure monitoring service, with dashboards, alerting, and visualizations of metrics. As cloud adoption increased, Datadog grew rapidly and expanded its product offerings to cover service providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, VMware, and OpenStack.


=== Company growth ===
In 2015, Datadog opened a research and development office in Paris.
In 2016, Datadog moved its New York City headquarters to a full floor of the New York Times Building to support its growing team, which doubled over the course of the year. Datadog announced the beta-release of Application Performance Monitoring in 2016, offering for the first time a full-stack monitoring solution. 
As of 2024, the company has more than 5,200 employees, the majority of which are located in the US, with offices in New York, Boston, Paris, Dublin, Denver, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Japan, Australia and Singapore.
Prior to Datadog's initial public offering (IPO) in September 2019, the company was offered over $7 billion to be acquired by Cisco, but rejected it in favor of going public.

Datadog offers a range of monitoring services to support engineering teams in effectively managing their cloud or hybrid environments. These services include Infrastructure Monitoring, Network Performance Monitoring, Network Device Monitoring, Serverless Monitoring, and Cloud Cost Management to help businesses maintain the reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness of their infrastructure and applications.


== Technology ==

Datadog uses a Go-based agent, rewritten from scratch since its major version 6.0.0 released on February 28, 2018. It was formerly Python-based, forked from the original created in 2009 by David Mytton for Server Density (previously called Boxed Ice). Its backend is built using a number of open and closed source technologies including D3, Apache Cassandra, Kafka, PostgreSQL, etc.
In 2014, Datadog support was broadened to multiple cloud service providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Red Hat OpenShift. As of October 2024, the company supports over 750 integrations.


== Funding ==
In 2010, Datadog launched with a seed round, with participation by NYC Seed, Contour Venture Partners, IA Ventures, Jerry Neumann and Alex Payne, among others. In 2012, it raised a $6.2 million Series A round co-led by Index Ventures and RTP Ventures. In 2014, Datadog raised a $15 million Series B round led by OpenView Venture Partners, followed by a $31 million Series C round led by Index Ventures in 2015. Datadog opened 2016 with a $94.5 million Series D round led by ICONIQ Capital, one of the largest funding rounds for a New York City company during that year.
Datadog went public via an IPO on the Nasdaq exchange on September 19, 2019, selling 24 million shares and raising $648 million, valuing the company at $8.7 billion. Datadog's stock price rose by approximately 37% on its first day of trading, and the company's market capitalization reached nearly $10 billion by the end of its first trading day.
