GLPI (acronym: French: Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique, or "Free IT Equipment Manager" in English) is an open source IT Asset Management, issue tracking system and service desk system. This software is written in PHP and distributed as open-source software under the GNU General Public License.
GLPI is a web-based application helping companies to manage their information system. The solution is able to build an inventory of all the organization's assets and to manage administrative and financial tasks. The system's functionalities help IT Administrators to create a database of technical resources, as well as a management and history of maintenances actions. Users can declare incidents or requests (based on asset or not) thanks to the Helpdesk feature.


== History ==
The GLPI Community based-project started in 2003 and was directed by the INDEPNET association. Through the years, GLPI became widely used by both communities and companies, leading to a need of professional services around the system. Whereas the INDEPNET Association did not intend to offer services around the software, in 2008 the Association created a Partners' Network in order to achieve various objectives:
The first objective was to build an ecosystem where Partners could participate in GLPI Project. Secondly, Partners would financially support the association, in order to ensure the necessary software development. And finally, the ecosystem would guarantee a service delivery through a known and identified Network, directly connected to INDEPNET.
In 2009, Teclib’ started to integrate the software, developed the GLPI code and  implemented new features. During summer 2015, the GLPI's Community leaders decided to transfer the roadmap management and the development leadership to Teclib’, so that Teclib´becomes editor of the GLPI system ensuring the software R&D.
The code remains under a GPL license and keeps its open source nature. The GLPI system continues to be improved thanks to the co-partnership between the community and the editor.
