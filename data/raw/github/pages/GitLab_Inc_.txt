GitLab Inc. is an American company that operates and develops GitLab, an open-core DevOps software package that can develop, secure, and operate software. GitLab includes a distributed version control system based on Git, including features such as access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project, as well as snippets. 
The open-source software project was created by Ukrainian developer Dmytro Zaporozhets and Dutch developer Sytse Sijbrandij. In 2018, GitLab Inc. was considered to be the first partly Ukrainian unicorn. GitLab has an estimated over 30 million registered users, including 1 million active licensed users. There are more than 3,300 code contributors and team members in 60+ countries.


== Overview ==
GitLab Inc. was established in 2014 to continue the development of the open-source code-sharing platform launched in 2011 by Dmytro (or Dmitriy) Zaporozhets. The company's co-founder Sytse Sijbrandij initially contributed to the project and decided to build a business around it. 
GitLab offers its platform using a freemium model. Since its founding, GitLab Inc. has promoted remote work and is known as one of the largest all-remote companies in the world. By 2020, the company employed 1300 people in 65 countries.


== History ==

The company participated in the YCombinator seed accelerator Winter 2015 program. By 2015, notable customers included Alibaba Group and IBM.
In January 2017, a database administrator accidentally deleted the production database in the aftermath of a cyberattack, causing the loss of a substantial amount of issue data and merge request data. The recovery process was live-streamed on YouTube.
In April 2018, GitLab Inc. announced integration with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to simplify the process of spinning up a new cluster to deploy applications.
In May 2018, GNOME moved to GitLab with over 400 projects and 900 contributors.
On August 1, 2018, GitLab Inc. started development of Meltano.
On August 11, 2018, GitLab Inc. moved from Microsoft Azure to Google Cloud Platform, making the service inaccessible to users in several regions including: Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, due to sanctions imposed by Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States. In order to overcome this limitation, the non-profit organization Framasoft began providing a Debian mirror to make GitLab CE available in those countries.
In 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, GitLab Inc. released "GitLab's Guide to All-Remote" as well as a course on remote management for the purpose of aiding companies interested in building all-remote work cultures. In April, the company expanded into the Australian and Japanese markets. By November, it was valued at more than $6 billion in a secondary market evaluation.
In 2021, OMERS participated in a secondary shares investment in GitLab Inc.
On March 18, 2021, GitLab Inc. licensed its technology to the Chinese company JiHu.
On June 30, 2021, GitLab Inc. spun out Meltano, an open source ELT platform.
On July 23, 2021, GitLab Inc. released its software Package Hunter, a Falco-based tool that detects malicious code, under the open-source MIT Licence.
On August 4, 2022, GitLab announced its plans for changing its Data Retention Policy and for automatically deleting inactive repositories which have not been modified for a year. As a result, in the following days GitLab received much criticism from the open-source community. Shortly after, it was announced that dormant projects would not be deleted, and would instead remain accessible in an archived state, potentially using a slower type of storage.
In May 2023, the company launched the "GitLab 16.0" platform as an AI-driven DevSecOps solution. It contained over 55 new features and enhancements.
In July 2024, Reuters reported that GitLab was exploring a potential sale after attracting acquisition interest, with cloud monitoring firm Datadog named as one of the interested parties.

== Adoption ==
GitLab Forge was officially adopted in 2023 by the French Ministry for Education to create a "Digital Educational Commons" of educational resources.


== Acquisitions ==
In March 2015, GitLab Inc. acquired the competing Git hosting service Gitorious, which had around 822,000 registered users at the time. The users of Gitorious were encouraged to migrate to GitLab, and the service was discontinued in June 2015.

In January 2018, GitLab Inc. acquired Gemnasium, a service that provided security scanners with alerts for known security vulnerabilities in open-source libraries of various languages. The service was scheduled for complete shut-down on May 15. Gemnasium features and technology was integrated into GitLab EE and as part of CI/CD.
On June 11, 2020, GitLab Inc. acquired Peach Tech, a security software firm specializing in protocol fuzz testing, and Fuzzit, a continuous "fuzz" security testing solution.

== Controversy ==
GitLab was ceasing its GitLab.com account services for users in mainland China, Macau, and Hong Kong, urging them to migrate to JiHu (gitlab.cn), the Chinese entity authorized to distribute and support GitLab in the region, by February 18, 2025, after which their accounts will be deleted. This decision follows GitLab's 2021 establishment of a Chinese joint venture, JiHu Information Technology (Hubei) Co., Ltd., to provide localized GitLab services tailored for the Chinese market, operating independently from GitLab.com with separate infrastructure and management.
In December 2024, JiHu faced severe internal and external criticism. A now-former JiHu GitLab DevOps architect publicly revealed an alleged "Endgame Plan" orchestrated by the company's CEO Liu Gang, which involved pressuring free GitLab CE users in China to become paying customers through potentially misleading legal tactics. Following these public accusations and a call for the CEO's removal, the architect was terminated and faced legal demands for retraction. He also made allegations regarding concealed American capital within JiHu GitLab, potentially posing national security risks due to the company's involvement with a Chinese aerospace entity.
