== Background ==
Development of Snes9x began in July 1997 when Gary Henderson's Snes96 and Jerremy Koot's Snes97 emulators merged to create Snes9x.  Snes9x was among the first to emulate most SNES enhancement chips at some level. In version 1.53, it added support for Cg shaders. Version 1.55 added support for the MSU1 enhancement chip  found on the SD2SNES 
The emulator PocketSNES for Pocket PCs is based on Snes9X.
There is also an unofficial Snes9x port compiled with Emscripten which runs inside a web browser.


== License ==
The source code of Snes9x is publicly available, but the license prohibits its commercial use.


== Reception ==
