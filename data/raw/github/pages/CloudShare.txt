== Services ==
CloudShare combines aspects of virtualization, cloud computing and advanced features to offer software as a service (Saas). Similar to virtual lab automation, CloudShare makes full-featured virtual enterprise environments available online and on-demand. This has applications including developing and testing, pre-sales demos, proofs-of-concept, evaluations, technical training, development and certification of hardware or software and channel enablement.
Customers can create multi-machine IT environments in the cloud or upload  existing virtual machines. CloudShare supports hypervisors (VMWare, Oracle VirtualBox ) and operating systems (Windows 7, Ubuntu), and provides templates for new machines with operating systems and even software (such as Microsoft SharePoint 2010, Microsoft Office 2010 or Ruby on Rails) preinstalled.
Created environments can consist of a single virtual machine or multiple networked machines and are able to operate seamlessly with the user’s physical PC or workstation.  These environments can then be saved, replicated and shared with additional users who are free to interact with their own independent replica (or “snapshot”).

CloudShare Enterprise is designed for enterprise-grade applications such as development and testing, virtual training, presales demos, proof of concepts, technical evaluations, and other IT functions. More robust and offering greater compute power and storage, as well as unlimited machines and sharing, CloudShare Enterprise also includes:
a user management dashboard with analytics tools
multiple user hierarchies, roles and privileges
customer branding
user-interface customization
integration with Salesforce.com
