== History ==
GitLab was created in 2011 by Ukrainian programmer Dmytro Zaporozhets as a side project written in Ruby on Rails. Sytse Sijbrandij wanted to sell it as a service, which Zaporozhets agreed to. So the GitLab B.V. was founded in Utrecht in the Netherlands. Later Zaporozhets quit his job and started as CTO at GitLab.
In 2015, GitLab was part of Y Combinator's winter batch and raised US$1.5 million in seed funding. In September, Khosla Ventures invested an additional $4 million into the company.
In September 2016 August Capital, Y Combinator and Khosla Ventures collected $20 million.
