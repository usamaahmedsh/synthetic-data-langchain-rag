Umbrellar Technology Group is a privately owned cloud solutions and technology services provider headquartered in Auckland, New Zealand.
Umbrellar was originally established in 1997 as Digiweb and has evolved through multiple acquisitions and brand consolidations.


== History ==
The company originated from the amalgamation of 10 New Zealand hosting and domain brands, including Digiweb, Web Drive, and Freeparking.
In August 2022, Umbrellar was acquired by Pax8, a global cloud marketplace provider. In 2025, Pax8 divested its New Zealand MSP unit, enabling the formation of Umbrellar Technology Group as an independent entity focused on cloud services and technology solutions.


== Infrastructure ==
Umbrellar operates multiple data centers in New Zealand, including a facility in Albany Heights.


=== Acquisitions ===
2005 – Freeparking acquired 2day.com.
2012 – Digiweb acquired Digital Network Limited.
2014 – Web Drive sold to Digiweb Holdings Limited.
Umbrellar Technology Group is privately held. Previous majority ownership was by Pencarrow PE via DWDA Holdings Limited; current structure reflects independence post-Pax8 divestment.
