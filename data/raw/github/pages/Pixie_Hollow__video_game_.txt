Pixie Hollow was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) addition to the Disney Fairies franchise that ran from 2008 to 2013. It was produced by DisneyToon Studios and developed by Schell Games. The game was released to coincide with the 2008 film, Tinker Bell and revolved around Tinker Bell, a fairy character created by J. M. Barrie in his play Peter Pan and incorporating her fairy friends from the Disney Fairies animated works by the Walt Disney Company.


== Gameplay ==
The first steps of the game was creating an avatar using various combinations of physical features and deciding the type of fairy the player would want to play as. After creating an avatar, the player was able to explore the land of Pixie Hollow and occasionally interact with some of the characters from the Disney Fairies franchise as well as other players of the game through various modes of chat. The game included these Disney Fairies characters throughout various kinds of game play. While exploring the world of Pixie Hollow, players were able to play talent games in order to gain various currencies known as which could be traded and could be used at Fairy stores to buy clothing or furnishings for the Fairy's home. Players with paid membership could own pets known as "Animal Friends" and care for them. Overall, this game provided children and fans of the Disney Fairies franchise a chance to escape into the world of Pixie Hollow.


== Critical reception ==
GameZone gave the game 6/10. The game received the Parents' Choice Award, Silver Honor. The game also received the Parents' Choice Approved award.
A 2008 article from the magazine Variety about the site voiced concerns from parents that introducing children to online games at a young age could "one day make them a World of Warcraft addict".  A New York Times article from 2007 voiced much of the same in its discussion about young children on the Internet. The article commented that site could allow users to play games ('help create the seasons') and interact with other 'fairies'. When avatars move across the screen, they leave a sparkling trail of pixie dust, a carefully designed part of the experience.


== Closing ==
Pixie Hollow closed on September 19, 2013. Its closure was poorly received by users, especially bloggers in the community, many of whom created petitions to "save Pixie Hollow".
