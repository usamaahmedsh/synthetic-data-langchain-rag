In computing, virtualization is the use of a computer to simulate another computer. The following is a chronological list of virtualization technologies.

=== 1960s ===

In the mid-1960s, IBM's Cambridge Scientific Center develops CP-40, the first version of CP/CMS. Experience on the CP-40 project provides input to the development of the IBM System/360 Model 67, announced in 1965. CP-40 is re-implemented for the S/360-67 as CP-67, and by April 1967, both versions are in daily production use.

1964
IBM Cambridge Scientific Center begins development of CP-40.
1965
IBM M44/44X, an experimental paging operating system, is in use at Thomas J. Watson Research Center.
IBM announces the IBM System/360-67, a 32-bit CPU with virtual memory hardware (August 1965).
1966
IBM ships the S/360-67 computer in June 1966.
IBM begins work on CP-67, a re-implementation of CP-40 for the S/360-67.
1967
In January, CP-40 goes into production time-sharing use, followed by CP-67 in April.
1968
CP/CMS is installed at eight initial customer sites.
CP/CMS is submitted to IBM Type-III Library by MIT's Lincoln Laboratory.
Resale of CP/CMS access begins at time-sharing vendor National CSS (becoming a distinct version, eventually renamed VP/CSS).


=== 1970s ===

IBM announces the System/370 in 1970. In 1972, IBM announces that virtual memory would be made available on all S/370 models, and also announces several virtual storage operating systems, including VM/370. By the mid-1970s, CP/CMS, VM, and VP/CSS are running on numerous large IBM mainframes.

1971
The first System/370, the S/370-155, is shipped in January.
1972
Announcement of virtual memory being added to System/370 series.
VM/370 announced – and running on announcement date. VM/370 includes the ability to run VM under VM (previously implemented both at IBM and at user sites under CP/CMS, but not made part of standard releases)
1973
First shipment of announced virtual memory S/370 models (April: -158, May: -168).
1977
Initial commercial release of VAX/VMS, later renamed OpenVMS.
1979
The chroot system call is introduced during development of Version 7 Unix, laying a foundation for container virtualization.


=== 1980s ===
1985
October 9, 1985: Announcement of the Intel 80286-based AT&T 6300+ with Simultask, a virtual machine monitor developed by Locus Computing Corporation in collaboration with AT&T, enabling the direct execution of an Intel 8086 realmode guest operating system under a host Unix System V Release 2 OS.
1987
January 1987: A "product evaluation" version of Merge/386 from Locus Computing Corporation is made available to OEMs. Merge/386 made use of the Virtual 8086 mode provided by the Intel 80386 processor, and supported multiple simultaneous virtual 8086 machines. The virtual machines supported unmodified guest operating systems and standalone programs such as Microsoft Flight Simulator; but in typical usage the guest was MS-DOS with a Locus proprietary redirector (also marketed for networked PCs as "PC-Interface") and a "network" driver that provided communication with a regular user-mode file server process running under the host operating system on the same machine.
October 1987: Retail Version 1.0 of Merge/386 begins shipping, offered with Microport Unix System V Release 3.
1988
SoftPC 1.0 for Sun is introduced in 1988 by Insignia Solutions. [1]
SoftPC appears in its first version for Apple Macintosh. These versions (Sun and Macintosh) only have support for DOS.


=== 1990s ===
1991
IBM introduces OS/2 Virtual DOS machine (VDM) with support for x86 virtual 8086 mode, capable of virtualizing DOS/Windows and other 16 bit operating systems like CP/M-86 [2]
1994
Kevin Lawton leaves MIT Lincoln Lab and starts the Bochs project. Bochs was initially coded for x86 architecture, capable of emulating BIOS, processor and other x86-compatible hardware, by simple algorithms, isolated from the rest of the environment, eventually incorporating the ability to run different processor algorithms under x86-architecture or the host, including bios and core processor (Itanium x64, x86_64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, etc.), and with the advantage that the application is multi platform (BSD, Linux, Windows, Mac, Solaris).
1997
The first version of Virtual PC for the Macintosh platform is released in June 1997 by Connectix.
1998
June 15: Simics/sun4m is presented at USENIX'98, demonstrating full system simulation booting Linux 2.0.30 and Solaris 2.6 unmodified from dd'ed disks. [3].

1999

February 8: VMware introduces the first x86 virtualization product for the Intel IA-32 architecture, known as VMware Virtual Platform, based on earlier research by its founders at Stanford University. VMware Virtual Platform is based on software emulation with a guest/host OS design that required all guest environments be stored as files under the host OS filesystem.

2014
The first public build of Kubernetes is released on September 8, 2014. When Kubernetes debuted, it offered a number of advantages over Docker, the most popular containerization platform at the time. The purpose of Kubernetes was to make it simple for users to deploy containerized applications across a sizable cluster of container hosts. In order to offer more features and functionality for managing containerized applications at scale, Kubernetes was created to complement Docker rather than to completely replace it.
