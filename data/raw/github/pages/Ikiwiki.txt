ikiwiki is a free and open-source wiki application, designed by Joey Hess. It is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later. ikiwiki is written in Perl, although external plugins can be implemented in any language.
Unlike conventional wiki software, ikiwiki stores its pages in a standard version control system such as Git, Subversion or others.


== Features ==
ikiwiki supports several lightweight markup languages, including Markdown, Creole, reStructuredText and Textile.
In the simplest case, it can function as an off-line static web site generator (possibly still allowing different users to submit changes through VCS; this method is sometimes referred to as wiki compiler), but it can use CGI to function as a normal web-interfaced wiki as well. Login via OpenID is supported.
ikiwiki can be used for maintaining a blog, and includes common blogging functionality such as comments and RSS feeds. The installer includes an option to set up a simple blog at install time.
ikiwiki is included in various Linux distributions, including Debian and Ubuntu.
