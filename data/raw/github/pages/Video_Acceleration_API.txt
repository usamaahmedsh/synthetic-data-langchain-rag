Video Acceleration API (VA-API) is an open source application programming interface that allows applications such as VLC media player or GStreamer to use hardware video acceleration capabilities, usually provided by the graphics processing unit (GPU). It is implemented by the free and open-source library libva, combined with a hardware-specific driver, usually provided together with the GPU driver.
VA-API video decode/encode interface is platform and window system independent but is primarily targeted at Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) in X Window System on Unix-like operating systems (including Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris), and Android, however it can potentially also be used with direct framebuffer and graphics sub-systems for video output. Accelerated processing includes support for video decoding, video encoding, subpicture blending, and rendering.
The VA-API specification was originally designed by Intel for its GMA (Graphics Media Accelerator) series of GPU hardware with the specific purpose of eventually replacing the XvMC standard as the default Unix multi-platform equivalent of Microsoft Windows DirectX Video Acceleration (DxVA) API, but today the API is no longer limited to Intel-specific hardware or GPUs. Other hardware and manufacturers can freely use this open standard API for hardware accelerated video processing with their own hardware without paying a royalty fee.


== Overview ==

The main motivation for VA-API is to enable hardware-accelerated video decode at various entry-points (VLD, IDCT, motion compensation, deblocking) for the prevailing coding standards today (MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP/H.263, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, H.265/HEVC, and VC-1/WMV3). Extending XvMC was considered, but due to its original design for MPEG-2 MotionComp only, it made more sense to design an interface from scratch that can fully expose the video decode capabilities in today's GPUs.


=== Supported hardware and drivers ===
As of 2022, VA-API is natively supported by:

Intel Quick Sync open-source drivers for Linux
Mesa open-source drivers for AMD and Nvidia graphics cards
AMDGPU-PRO drivers for AMD graphics cards on Linux
libva-vdpau-driver for cards supported by VDPAU
Direct3D 12 implementations with the VAOn12 driver


=== Supported video codecs ===
VA-API currently supports these video codecs in the official mainline version, but note that exactly which video codecs are supported depends on the hardware and the driver's capabilities.

MPEG-2 decode acceleration Main Profile
VC-1 / WMV3 decode acceleration Advanced Profile

VP9 8-bit encode acceleration
VP9 8-bit and 10-bit decode acceleration
AV1 8-bit and 10-bit encode acceleration

== Processes that can be accelerated with VA-API ==
Video decoding and post-processing processes that can be offloaded and accelerated if both the device drivers and GPU hardware supports them:

Motion compensation
Inverse discrete cosine transform
In-loop deblocking filter
Intra-frame prediction
variable-length decoding, more commonly known as slice-level acceleration
Bitstream processing (Context-adaptive variable-length coding/Context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding)


== Software architecture ==

The current interface is window system independent, so that it can potentially be used with graphics sub-systems other than the DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure) in X Window System, such as direct with framebuffer, and it can work with third-party DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) libraries. In a nutshell, it is a scheme to pass various types of data buffers from the application to the GPU for decoding or encoding a compressed bit-stream.
