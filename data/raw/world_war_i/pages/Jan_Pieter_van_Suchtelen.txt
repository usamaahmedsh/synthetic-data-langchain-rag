Jan Pieter van Suchtelen, Count of Liikkala, Pyotr Kornilovich Suchtelen/Sukhtelen (2 August 1751, in Grave – 6 January 1836, in Stockholm), was born in the Netherlands, and was a general in the Russian army during the Russo-Swedish War (1808–1809). In 1812 Suchtelen was the plenipotentiary for Russian Emperor Alexander I in Örebro where he negotiated and signed the Treaty of Örebro which brought to an end the Anglo-Russian War (1807–1812). In that treaty his titles included "general of engineers, quarter-master general, [and] member of the council of state".
He was active as military engineer. He established a preliminary project of the Modlin fortress, near Warsaw, when Russia captured this area after the third partition of Poland.  
Since 1783 he actively worked in Russia. For his project of Staro-Kalinkin Bridge in St Petersburg he was promoted to the rank of colonel. 
Created count, enrolled to the nobility of Finland where his main estate was located. 
Charlotte Disbrowe visited Sweden in 1834, where her father, (Sir Edward Cromwell Disbrowe, a senior diplomat with the British Foreign Office) was stationed. She met Van Suchtelen and mentioned in her biography that:

Amongst the visitors I had forgotten to name  General Suchtelen, the Russian Minister, who had  been in Sweden from time immemorial, and was  supposed to have come out of the ark. He was made very much of at that Court, indeed was  allowed privileges not granted to other diplomatists, and my father had some difficulty in consequence of obtaining the proper position due to him as the accredited Minister of the Court of St. James.  General Suchtelen had two brothers attached to his Legation as secretaries, of the name of Bodisko. They were known as Beau Disko and Laid Disko, for obvious reasons.
