The American Quartet recorded the song with conductor Rosario Bourdon. The bass vocals were John H. Meyer and William F. Hooley. The tenor vocals were Billy Murray and Albert Campbell. It was recorded on September 26, 1917 and released under the Victor Record label. Arthur Fields also recorded a version of the song, which was released in 1918 under Edison Blue Amberol,with Billy Murray, John Young, Steve Porter and Donald Chalmers in the chorus.
The song was instantly successful upon its release. It was reminiscent of the 1912 British war song, "It's a Long Way to Tipperary".
The sheet music can be found at the Pritzker Military Museum & Library.
The song is about Rueben Plank, a "husky Yank", who enlists in the army. He is determined to "get that Kaiser Bill". The chorus is what Corporal Plank and his squad sings, directed to Kaiser Wilhelm II:
