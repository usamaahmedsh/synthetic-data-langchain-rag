== Disambiguation ==
Khavari, the historian contemporary to Sohrab Khan, recorded a distinct title for Sohrab Khan, i.e. Gholam-e Pishkhedmat-bashi (غلام پیشخدمت‌باشی, lit. chief of staff). Khavari also narrated the events involving another  Sohrab Khan Gorji who had his own distinct title, i.e. tahvildar (تحویلدار, lit. treasurer) and was also contemporary to the historian. They were two different individuals both named Sohrab Khan Gorji but with their own unique titles and fields of work.
However, the 21st-century researcher Kondo, while his main research was about Sohrab, the treasurer, somehow interpreted the Khavari's reference such that they are both the same Sohrab.
