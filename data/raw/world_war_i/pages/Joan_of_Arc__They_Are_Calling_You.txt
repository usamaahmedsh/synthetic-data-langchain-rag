During World War I, it was common for French soldiers to carry an image of Joan of Arc when going into battle. Although she was not canonized a saint until 1920, Joan of Arc represented the devotion of the soldier who fought for France. The lyrics of the song portrays the French soldiers' calling out to Joan of Arc. The chorus reads: 

"Joan of Arc, Joan of Arc,
Do your eyes, from the skies, see the foe?
Don't you see the drooping fleur-de-lis
Can't you hear the tears of Normandy?
Joan of Arc, Joan of Arc,
Let your spirit guide us through.
Come lead your France to victory;
Joan of Arc, they are calling you."
