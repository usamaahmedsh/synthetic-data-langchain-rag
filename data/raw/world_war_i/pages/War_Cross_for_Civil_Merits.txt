The War Cross for Civil Merits (German: Kriegskreuz für Zivilverdienste) was a civil award of Austria-Hungary.  Established on 16 August 1915 by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, it recognized civilian war service during World War I.  The cross could also be awarded to military officers for their contributions to the war but were not directly involved in combat operations.
