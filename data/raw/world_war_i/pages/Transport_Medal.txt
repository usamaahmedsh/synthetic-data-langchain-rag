The Transport Medal was a British campaign medal sanctioned on 8 November 1903 and awarded by the Lord Commissioners of the Admiralty. It was awarded to masters and officers of merchant ships employed by the Transport Service to move troops to either South Africa during the South African War or to China during the Boxer Rebellion. The officers of hospital ships also qualified.
It was intended that the medal would be awarded for any future campaign where a medal was issued to the troops taking part, but it was not awarded again after the South Africa and China wars.
The medal, 1.4 inches (36 mm) in diameter, is silver and has a plain straight swivel suspender. The obverse bears the head of King Edward VII in Royal Navy uniform, with the inscription EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR.The reverse depicts HMS Ophir beneath a map of the world with, below, the words in Latin OB PATRIAM MILITIBUS PER MARE TRANSVECTIS ADJUTAM which translates as for services rendered in transporting troops by sea.The recipient's name, although not his rank or ship, is impressed in block capitals on the rim of the medal. However for those who were ship masters the notation "IN COMMAND" was added after their names.The 1.25 inches (32 mm) wide ribbon is red, with a blue stripe towards each edge.
