Press in the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR, Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan Xalq Cümhuriyyətində mətbuat) is one of the stages in the history of the Azerbaijani press (1918–20). During these two years, there were about 100 newspapers and magazines published in ADR.


== Ideology ==
From the point of view of ideological propaganda, the press of 1918-20 can be grouped as follows: the national press (of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic), the Bolshevik press (opposition), the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik press, etc.
The text of the national publications published in Baku, Ganja, Shusha, Tiflis and other cities was written and published not only in Azerbaijani-Turkish, but also in Russian, Georgian, Polish, Persian, German and other languages.


== Foundation ==
Representatives of Azerbaijani intelligentsia: Hasan bey Zardabi, Alimardan bey Topchubashev, Ismail bey Gasparly and others had a strong influence on the emergence and subsequent development of the national press.
The "Charter on the Press", adopted in accordance with Decree of the Parliament of the ADR dated October 30, 1919, stated that it is sufficient to submit an application to the Inspector General for Press Affairs in order to get permission for the publication. The decree of November 9, 1918 abolished state control over the content, publication and distribution of the press and mass media.
In March 1919, the Council of Ministers decided to establish the Azerbaijan Telegraph Agency.
