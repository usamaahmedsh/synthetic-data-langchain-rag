"Good-bye-ee!" is a popular song written and composed by R. P. Weston and Bert Lee. Performed by music hall stars Florrie Forde, Daisy Wood, and Charles Whittle, it was a hit in 1917.
Weston and Lee got the idea for the song when they saw a group of factory girls calling out goodbye to soldiers marching to Victoria station. They were saying the word in the exaggerated way which had been popularised as a catchphrase by comedian Harry Tate.   They then travelled to Brighton and wrote the song on a wet afternoon in their cabin under the pier.
The song lent its name to "Goodbyeee", the final episode of the sitcom Blackadder Goes Forth.


== Chorus ==

The salutations at the end of the chorus are from various languages.  Bonsoir is French for goodnight.  Chin chin is a Chinese toast. "Nahpoo" and "toodle-oo" are English idioms from corruptions of the French il n'y en a plus (there is no more) and à tout à l'heure (see you later).
