Camp Quedlinburg was a POW camp built in September 1914 located 2 kilometers north of Quedlinburg, Germany, during the First World War. From 1914 to 1922, the camp housed 12,000 to 18,000 prisoners of war on average. Around 27,000 people lived in the neighbouring city of Quedlinburg at that time. There were three official branch offices in Staßfurt, Atzendorf and Aschersleben as well as other unofficial offices in Egeln, Halberstadt, Schönebeck, Groß Rodensleben, Schadeleben and Hedersleben.

The camp was built on 104 hectares of land with 48 barracks for the prisoners. Barbed wire fences were erected to prevent escape attempts. In eight double rows, there were three barracks on each side of the gable. To the northeast, there were eight barracks for the guards, and on the western side of Ditfurter Weg, a number of large administrative buildings. At the northwest of the camp were three isolated sick shelters. Guard towers with machine guns stood in the middle of each long side and at strategically important points. The wooden barracks were about 52 meters long and 12 to 15 meters wide. The interior of the barracks was sparsely furnished. Each prisoner slept in an approximately 80 cm wide, 2 metre long wooden bed on straw sacks covered with woollen blankets. The barracks were divided into halves by transverse walls, each heated by an oven in the middle. At the southwest end of a block of six barracks was a kitchen building. 
During the war, mainly Russian, French, Belgian and English, and also Italian soldiers were interned since 1917. From the beginning they were used to build up the camp and later as workers in labour detachments, especially in agriculture.
On 9 December 1918, Theodor Cizeck Zeilau (1884-1970), a Captain in the Danish Army, made an inspection visit of the camp at Quedlinburg.
Even after the war it was used as a transit camp. It was not until 1921 that the last Russian prisoners left the camp, whereupon it was burned down. 703 prisoners of war were buried on a special part of the Quedlinburg central cemetery.
