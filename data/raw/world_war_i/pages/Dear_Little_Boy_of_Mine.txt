== Analysis ==
The song is written in first person from the point of view of a parent, who longs for her son. The narrator recounts moments of her son's childhood that she thinks of, often when she is lonely. It is not made clear whether the son has simply grown up and left home, gone to war, or has died. The lyrics can be interpreted various ways. Below is a sample of the lyrics: 

Boy of mine, boy of mine
Altho' my heart was aching,
I seemed to know you wanted to go,
Pride in your manhood waking.
I'll be here, waiting, dear
Till at a glad dawn's breaking,
I'll hear you say you're home to stay,
Dear little boy of mine.
