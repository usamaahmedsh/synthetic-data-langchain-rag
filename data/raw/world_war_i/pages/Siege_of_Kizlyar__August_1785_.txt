The siege of Kizlyar in August 1785 was the second and final attempt of Chechen forces and Kumyk allies led by Sheikh Mansur to capture the Kizlyar fortress.


== History ==
After the defeat in Grigoripolis, the Kumyk people invited Sheikh Mansur to their country. With the support of Kumyk nobles, Mansur launched another attack on Kizlyar on 19 August 1785. During the siege, however, the Russians bribed some of the Kumyk princes, who turned against Mansur. As the latter began withdrawing his forces, he was ambushed by a Russian army, including an infantry regiment from Tomsk, which was coming to help, but Mansur managed to withdraw his forces without suffering many losses.
