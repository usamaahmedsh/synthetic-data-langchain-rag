== Lyrics ==
Angels, they are weeping over the foreign wars
Changed will be the pictures of the foreign lands
Trains, Ports are sailing from shore to shore
Maps will change entirely to different hands
Brave Heroes are falling to arise no more
Kings and Queens may ever rule their fellow man
But still, the bugles calling every man to war
But pray they'll be united like our own free land
After the war is over and the world's at peace
Many a heart will be aching after the war has ceased
Many a heart will be vacant, Many a child will be alone
But I hope they'll all be happy in a place called home sweet home
