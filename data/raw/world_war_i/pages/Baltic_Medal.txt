The Baltic Medal was a campaign medal approved on 6 June 1856, for issue to officers and men of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, and Royal Sappers and Miners who served between March 1854 and August 1855 in the Baltic Sea operations against Russia in the Baltic theatre of the Crimean War, or Åland War.  The medal primarily covered naval actions but was also awarded to 106 men of the Royal Sappers and Miners who were landed to place demolition charges against Russian fortifications at Bomarsund and Sveaborg.

Clasps: None were authorised.
Ribbon: The 31.7 millimetres (1.25 in) wide ribbon is yellow with light blue edges, reversing the colours of the Crimea Medal ribbon.
Naming: Issued unnamed, except for the 106 medals awarded to Royal Sappers and Miners, which had the recipient's name and unit impressed on the rim of the medal in block Roman capitals. Some naval recipients had their medals privately engraved.
Officers and men who were eligible for the medal were required to apply to the Accountant-General of the Navy.  In 1858 the Admiralty announced that officers who served as agents for transports would be eligible.
