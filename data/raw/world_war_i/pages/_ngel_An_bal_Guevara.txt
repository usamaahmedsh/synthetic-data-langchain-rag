Ángel Aníbal Guevara Rodríguez (; born 2 October 1925) is a former Guatemalan Army officer and politician. He was born in La Democracia, Escuintla in 1925.
Having served as defense minister, Guevara was victorious in the 1982 presidential election to succeed outgoing President Fernando Romeo Lucas García, who had hand-picked him as his successor. However, the election was widely denounced as fraudulent by both left-wing and right-wing groups. A military-led coup d'état, two weeks after the election, prevented Guevara from assuming power and instead installed a three-man junta headed by Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt.
He ran again in 1995 but failed to gain much support.
Currently, he is on Interpol's Red Notice list for crimes against humanity.
