When the sun goes down in Normandy
And the campfires are all a-glow
I'm dreaming of my lady love
Who's so far away across the waters
One of America's fairest daughters
Gee! Tonight I'm lonesome and blue
and gee! I know that you're lonesome too
When the sun goes down in Normandy
Then is when I sit and dream of you
The sheet music can be found at Pritzker Military Museum & Library.
