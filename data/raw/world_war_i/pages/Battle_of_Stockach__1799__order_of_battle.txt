On 25 March 1799, French and Habsburg armies fought for control of the geographically strategic Hegau in present-day Baden-Württemberg. The battle has been called by various names: First Battle of Stockach, the Battle by Stockach, and, in French chronicles, the Battle of Liptingen (or Leibtengen). In the broader military context, this battle comprises a keystone in the first campaign in southwestern Germany during the Wars of the Second Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars.  For an explanation of the types of forces, please see Types of military forces in the Napoleonic Wars.


== Background ==
Stockach lies at the junction of east–west and north–south roads on the eastern side of the Black Forest.  Strategically, control of the location offered access between the Swiss and Italian theaters and those in southern, central and northern Germany.  French control would protect access to the Black forest and the Rhine, of strategic importance in the Directory's plans to force the Habsburg army back to Vienna.
The day-long battle at Stockach and Engen pitted the two armies against each other for the second time in seven days.  The Austrians still had the numerical superiority, but this time it was closer to two-to-one, instead of almost three-to-one.  Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line, and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command.  Charles, likewise, had shortened his line; although Hotze had not yet caught up with the archduke, he and his 10,000 men were approaching from the Austrians' left rear.
