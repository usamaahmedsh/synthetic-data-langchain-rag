Mehmed Indariqo Shupago (Adyghe: Мэхьмэд Индарыкъо Шупаго), was the leader of Pshada, a noble of the Natukhai, and a Circassian leader. He is mentioned as "Indar-oku" in James Bell's book.


== Biography ==
Not much is recorded about Indariqo, as Circassians did not write down their history, and all knowledge comes from Russian and British sources. He was the largest landowner in the Pshada Valley and is known to have vassal nobles under his command. He is occasionally mentioned in the books of James Bell and Eduard Taitbout de Marigny. His religion was Christianity.
As he aged, the leadership of the Shupago family passed from Indariqo to Hawduqo Mansur.


=== Name ===
Mehmed's surname is Shupago, and "Indariqo" means "son of Indar." The Circassians had both surnames and titles ending with the "-qo" suffix, which is equivalent to the "-son" in English.


== Russo-Circassian War ==
Although he initially ensured the safety of Russian merchant ships and received gifts from the Russian Tsar, he later frequently took part in Circassian campaigns against the Russians.
He actively participated in battles against the Russians. On July 8, 1837, during clashes in Pshada, Indariqo's grandson and two of his vassals were injured. Later that year, his village was attacked and destroyed by a detachment under General Alexey Veliaminov. Consequently, Indariqo and his family migrated to Ts'emez (modern-day Novorossiysk).

"We are too poor to recompense the English properly for thinking us in our distress; but God will reward them; and every day in my prayers, I pray God to do so. I am now old and very infirm, and my only wish before I die is, that I may see my country free and at peace."
