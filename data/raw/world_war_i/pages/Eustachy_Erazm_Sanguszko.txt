On 3 February 1789, Sanguszko began service in the Crown Army as a captain in the 8th National Cavalry Brigade. On 5 October 1789, he was promoted to major, and on 28 April 1792, to vice-brigadier. He was a representative of the Lublin Voivodeship in the Great Sejm of 1788–1792. Sanguszko partook in the War of the Second Partition where he fought at the Battle of Zieleńce as a cavalry brigadier, receiving the Virtuti Militari in its wake on 23 June. On 29 July 1792, the 24-year-old Sanguszko was promoted to brigadier, having taken over the command of the whole brigade on 25 June.
