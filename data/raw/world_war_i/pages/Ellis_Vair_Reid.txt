Ellis Vair Reid DSC (31 October 1889 – 28 July 1917) was a Canadian First World War flying ace, officially credited with 19 victories.
Reid spent his early years in Belleville, Ontario and moved to Toronto with his family at the turn of the century. After completing high school, Reid attended the University of Toronto School of Architecture, graduating in 1915. It was at this time that Reid's love of flying began to emerge. On 2 January 1916, Reid attested to Britain's Royal Naval Air Service and began training at the Curtiss Flying School in Toronto. He sailed to England from New York City and received his Royal Aero Club Aviator's certificate in July 1916.
He was posted to No. 3 Wing after completing his training and in early 1917, was assigned to No. 10 (Naval) Squadron, where he flew alongside other Canadian aces in Black Flight, led by Raymond Collishaw, one of the greatest aces of the war. Reid's plane disappeared over Ypres on 28 July 1917 and his remains were never found.
He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Reid is commemorated on the Arras Flying Memorial.
