Clément Pansaers (1 May 1885 – 31 October 1922) was the main proponent of the Dada movement in Belgium.
He began writing poetry in 1916 after abandoning his career as an Egyptologist. Along with several members of the Brussels avant-garde circle, he founded the review Résurrection, which published early texts by Carl Einstein, Pierre Jean Jouve, Franz Werfel, and others.
His first properly "Dadaist" work, Pan-Pan au Cul du Nu Nègre was published in 1920. This pamphlet, along with Bar Nicanor (1921), was read and admired by figures like James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Theo van Doesburg, Francis Picabia and André Breton.
Pansaers moved to Paris in 1921, where he took part in Dada manifestations until his early death from Hodgkin's disease.
