"'O surdato 'nnammurato" (pronounced [o surˈdɑːtə nːamːuˈrɑːtə]; transl. "The Soldier in Love") is a famous song written in the Neapolitan language. The song is used as the anthem of S.S.C. Napoli.
The words were written by Aniello Califano and the music composed by Enrico Cannio in 1915. The song describes the sadness of a soldier who is fighting at the front during World War I, and who pines for his beloved. Originally Cannio's sheet music was published with piano accompaniment, but in recordings, on 78rpm, then LP, Neapolitan standards such as "'O surdato 'nnammurato" have usually been orchestrated to suit each tenor.

So many nights without you
