The Upsurging People's Force (Tamil: பொங்கி எழும் மக்கள் படை) was a militant group in Sri Lanka. 
The group was unknown until February 2006, when it claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on Sri Lankan army and navy cadre in the north and east of Sri Lanka in December 2005 and January 2006.  It claimed responsibility for a series of further claymore mine attacks on soldiers and police officers on 15 April 2006, but has not issued any public communiques since then.
