== Historical Context ==
Bouboulina 1959 Is set during the Greek Revolution of 1821 against the occupying Ottoman Empire and its Sultan Mahmud II (1808-1839). The Ottoman Empire was caught off guard and reacted in disbelief that the Greeks would stage an unprovoked revolt against its far greater occupant. Women played a crucial role in the revolution, most notably in the town of Mani located in the coast of Southern Greece where out of 1500 combatants fending off an Egyptian and Turkish attack, 1000 were women. Laskarina Bouboulina remains the most famed female revolutionary fighter. She participated in numerous naval sieges as well as horseback battles on land.
