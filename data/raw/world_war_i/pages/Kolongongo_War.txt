The Kolongongo War was a war fought between the Mbunda people and the Portuguese in 1914. The war occurred as a result of the Portuguese's desire to expand their powers which was met with resistance by the Mbunda people. The Mbunda people often travelled around Africa trading goods and had minimal settlement until approximately 1500 when they settled in what is now south-eastern Angola.
