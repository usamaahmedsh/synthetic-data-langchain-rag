== Creation of the battalion ==

This success cost the lives of 57 defenders of the fortress and wounded another 155 soldiers. On 16 August 1915, the 1st Ust-Dvina Latvian Riflemen Battalion was formed to defend Riga from volunteers who had not yet reached the draft age. The battalion's flag depicted a rising sun with crossed swords and the motto "Do not worry, soldiers, the silver sun is rising" (Latvian: Nebēdaities kara vīri, sidrabota saule lēc). Initially, each battalion composed of four companies and five teams: reconnaissance, machine gunners, mounted demolition specialists, communications, and supplies. The battalion's staff consisted of 26 officers, seven doctors and officials, and 1,246 non-commissioned officers and soldiers. It also possessed 164 horses, four machine guns and 47 carts. Each battalion formed its own combat orchestra. During the Ķekava battles in the summer of 1916, two more companies were created within the battalion.

However, the attack stopped because no reserves were sent. On the evening of 5 January, as a result of several German counterattacks, it was not possible to hold the breakthrough site, and the rifle units were forced to retreat to their original positions.
