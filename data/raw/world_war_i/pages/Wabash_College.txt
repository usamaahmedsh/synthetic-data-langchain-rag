Wabash College is a private, men's liberal arts college in Crawfordsville, Indiana, United States. Founded in 1832 by a group of Dartmouth College graduates and Midwestern leaders, the institution was originally named "The Wabash Teachers Seminary and Manual Labor College". It was later renamed Wabash College in 1851. The college was founded with the intention of providing classical and English education to young men in the region, aiming to develop future educators and clergy.
As of 2024, Wabash College enrolled approximately 835 undergraduate students. The academic program is structured into three divisions: natural sciences, humanities and arts, and social sciences. Students can choose from 36 majors and minors, with popular fields of study including rhetoric, economics, history, and biology. A distinctive feature of the Wabash curriculum is the comprehensive examination process for seniors, which includes both written and oral components to assess students' mastery in their major disciplines.
Wabash College is one of only three non-religious, all-male, four-year colleges remaining in the United States, alongside Hampden–Sydney College and Morehouse College. The college maintains a strong tradition of single-sex education, emphasizing close-knit community and leadership development.


== History ==

Wabash College was founded on November 21, 1832, by a group of Presbyterian ministers and laymen in Crawfordsville, Indiana. Seeking to bring classical and moral education to the American frontier, the founders envisioned a "classical and English high school, rising into a college as soon as the wants of the country demand." The next day, they dedicated the campus grounds in prayer while kneeling in the snow—a moment that became symbolic of Wabash's spiritual and intellectual mission.

Classes began in 1833 on education, and Elihu W. Baldwin became the college's first president in 1835. Early instruction emphasized Classical education, Theology, and a short-lived Manual labor school model. Despite early financial hardship and a devastating fire in 1838, Wabash quickly rebuilt. It developed a distinguished faculty, notably Caleb Mills, a founder of Indiana Department of Education, and Edmund Otis Hovey, who served as professor, trustee, treasurer, and fundraiser for over four decades.
By the mid-19th century, Wabash had become known for its liberal arts education, rooted in classical studies, rhetoric, and moral philosophy. Student life was centered around literary societies such as the Euphronean and Calliopean, which provided early platforms for oratory and debate.
Under president Joseph F. Tuttle (1862–1892), the campus added buildings such as Center Hall and Peck Hall, while Wabash increasingly emphasized scientific education alongside the classics.

In the 20th century, president George L. Mackintosh (1903–1926) instituted major reforms, including the development of the Wabash Plan, which emphasized faculty-student dialogue, senior comprehensive exams, and a distinctive curriculum rooted in interdisciplinary learning. During World War I, Wabash hosted a Student Army Training Corps unit, and during World War II, the college trained Navy officers through the V-12 Navy College Training Program.
The postwar period brought enrollment growth through the G.I. Bill and further academic reform. Despite broader national trends toward coeducation, Wabash remained a men's college, reaffirming that identity via a campus-wide referendum in 1992. In 1996, under the direction of James Fisher, Wabash became the first college in America to stage Tony Kushner's Angels in America.
In the 21st century, Wabash has prioritized global learning, undergraduate research, and leadership programs like WabashX. The college maintains vibrant traditions such as Chapel Sing, Ringing In and Out, and the annual Monon Bell Classic against DePauw University. With a strong alumni network, modern facilities, and enduring commitment to the liberal arts, Wabash continues its mission: "to educate men to think critically, act responsibly, lead effectively, and live humanely."

=== Traditions ===

One of Wabash's most symbolic ceremonies is Ringing In Saturday, which marks the beginning of each student's college experience. Incoming freshmen are formally welcomed by the dean of students, the dean of admissions, the president of the alumni association, and the college president. Each student is ceremonially "rung in" by the president using the same bell that Caleb Mills, the college's first teacher, used in the 1830s.
During Homecoming Week, Wabash hosts Chapel Sing, a spirited and widely recognized tradition where fraternity pledges (and independent students) attempt to sing the college fight song, Old Wabash, in unison before a panel of judges. Organized by the Student Senate and the Sphinx Club, Chapel Sing symbolizes school pride and serves as a rite of passage.

Wabash College does not employ a traditional student code of conduct. Instead, the institution relies on a single guiding principle known as the Gentleman's Rule:The student is expected to conduct himself at all times, both on and off campus, as a gentleman and a responsible citizen.This rule entrusts students with personal responsibility for their actions and is considered the college's oldest and most defining tradition. It is enforced through community standards, administrative discretion, and peer accountability rather than a formal disciplinary code.

A notable contribution to the campaign was a $40 million gift from alumni Paul Woolls '75 and his wife, Betty O'Shaughnessy Woolls, marking the largest single donation in the college's history.


=== Endowment management ===
In 2015, Wabash College partnered with Strategic Investment Group to serve as its outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). This collaboration has yielded significant returns; over a seven-year period, endowment returns exceeded benchmarks by $14.1 million.
The college employs a 12-quarter rolling average to determine its annual endowment draw, which was set at 5.5% for fiscal years 2022 and 2023. This approach aims to provide a predictable stream of funding while preserving the endowment's long-term purchasing power.
