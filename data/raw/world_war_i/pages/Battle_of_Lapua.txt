The Battle of Lapua was fought between Swedish and Russian troops on 14 July 1808 at Lapua, Finland. The battle was a part of the Finnish War of 1808–1809. The Russians had set up defences around Lapua. The Swedes tried to outflank and surround the defending Russians. The Björneborg Regiment under Georg Carl von Döbeln distinguished itself during the battle.
In the end the Russians managed to retreat, but the victory was an important one for the Swedish as it allowed them to continue their offensive.
