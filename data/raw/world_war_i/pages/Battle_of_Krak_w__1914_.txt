The Battle of Krakow (Russian: Краковская Битва, romanized: Krakovskaya Bitwa); (German: Krakauer Schlacht) took place on the Eastern Front during World War I from November 16 to November 28, 1914. In western Galicia, the Russian 9th and 3rd Armies advanced to the Dunac and pushed back the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army between Krakow and the northern slopes of the Beskids. A counterattack by retreating Austro-Hungarian troops in the northern section of the Vistula was repulsed by the Russians, and then came to a standstill. As a result of the unsuccessful attacks of the German 9th Army in the decisive Battle of Lodz, the battles for Krakow were interrupted by both sides after two weeks of fighting. At the end of November, the chief of the General Staff of Austria-Hungary, Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, hastily began to regroup for a new counteroffensive at Limanova-Lapanov to stop the Russian breakthrough in northern Hungary.

In October, the numerical advantage was on the side of the Austrians, but they were drained of blood, and two armies that had previously operated against the Germans returned to the disposal of the Russians. They now had almost triple the numerical superiority. The task of the Austrians was to gain time and wait for reserves, And after that, go on the offensive. To slow down the Russians, the Central Powers burned everything in the district, which led to deaths and displacement of civilians.

The Austrians hoped that the next day they would be able to stop the Russians, the directive stated: 

The outcome of tomorrow's attacks (November 18) by all three armies is crucial for success in the war. There is no superior opponent in front of us. The enemy is tired, he has problems with ammunition and supplies. His staff is also downsized. Everyone should be aware that lost time cannot be returned.

The Central Powers were retreating quickly, and the Russians did not have the strength to pursue them.
However, the 3rd Army had these forces, which arrived fresh to reinforce the Allies, on November 26 it launched a decisive offensive, defeated the enemy and captured 7,000 people. The Germans switched to the tactics of stubborn defense, only the 3rd Army advanced in front, by the end of November 27, its offensive had subsided, it was very reluctant to pursue the enemy due to heavy losses.
