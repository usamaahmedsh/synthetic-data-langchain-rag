This is a list of combat vehicles of World War I, including conceptual, experimental, prototype, training and production vehicles. The vehicles in this list were either used in combat, produced or designed during the First World War.
World War One saw the start of modern armoured warfare with an emphasis on using motor vehicles to provide support to the infantry.


== Key ==


== Tanks ==

Tanks came about as means to break the stalemate of trench warfare. They were developed to break through barbed wire and destroy enemy machine gun posts. The British and the French were the major users of tanks during the war; tanks were a lower priority for Germany as it assumed a defensive strategy. The few tanks that Germany built were outnumbered by the number of French and British tanks captured and reused.
