The Komańcza Republic, also known as the Eastern Lemko Republic, Vyslik Republic, Wisłok Republic and Lemko Republic, was a short-lived microstate, an association of thirty three Lemko villages, seated in Komańcza in the east of the Lemko Region, that existed between 4 November 1918 and 24 January 1919. It was headed by Head of the Council (голова Повітової Української Національної Ради, Head of the Ukrainian National County Council) Rev. Panteleymon Shpylka.
Unlike the contemporaneous Lemko Republic to its west (which sought unification with the Russian Soviet Republic), the Komancza Republic planned to unite with the West Ukrainian People's Republic in an independent Ukrainian state. However, this was suppressed by the Polish government as part of the Polish–Ukrainian War.
The Treaty of Saint-Germain made Galicia west of the San Polish.
