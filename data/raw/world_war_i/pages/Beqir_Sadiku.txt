Following the decision to demobilize after the signing of the Končulj Agreement in May 2001, Beqir Sadiku returned to his homeland, now representing the emblem of the National Liberation Army. He formed a combat platoon and organized the defense of his village against the Macedonian forces. The Battle of Slupčane and Orizare erupted on 3 May 2001, where after a month of heavy fighting, he would manage to hold on to the villages of Slupčane and Orizare, when Macedonian forces held all of their operations in the Karadak region. After the withdrawal of Macedonian troops in the Lipkovo-Karadak region, Beqiri, together with a significant portion of the 113th Brigade, captured Aračinovo on June 12, 2001. This capture marked a turning point in the Macedonian conflict, leading to the heaviest battle and crisis throughout the entire conflict. On June 22, 2001, Macedonian forces launched a massive attack against the NLA. During the battle, Beqiri sustained injuries and later died in the hospital on the same day. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the NLA managed to defend the village and repel the Macedonian forces.
