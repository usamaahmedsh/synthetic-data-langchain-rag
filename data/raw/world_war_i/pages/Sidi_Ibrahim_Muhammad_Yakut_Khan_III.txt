== Biography ==
He was born on 23 December 1886 to Abdul Kadir Khan. In January 1887, his father abdicated as the Nawab of Sachin in his favour, and he succeeded him on 7 February 1887. Due to his minority, the affairs of Sachin were placed under the administration of the British Government. 
He was brought up in infancy by a European lady Miss Rix. At the age of eleven, he was sent to Rajkumar College in Rajkot, where he remained until 1902, after which he was sent to Mayo College in Ajmer. In 1904, he entered the Imperial Cadet Corps and, after completing his course with a good conduct certificate in 1906, left the institution. Afterward, he became involved in the administration of Sachin to gain a clearer understanding of how the state's affairs were managed. He was invested with full administrative powers on 4 May 1907. On the same day, he was also presented with the key to the state treasury. On 23 June 1909, at the Council Hall, Pune, a sword of honour was presented to him. He was also granted a personal salute of eleven guns which entitled him to the style of His Highness. He attended the Delhi Durbar of 1911. On the occasion, he wore the uniform of the Imperial Cadet Corps and paid homage to George V by laying his sword at his feet, bowing three times with folded hands, and repeated the same ceremony before the Mary. He introduced free primary education in all villages of his state. He was selected by the Viceroy and Governor-General of India for active service during World War I. He accompanied the Indian contingent to France. He served with distinction in the East African Campaign during the war. He was present at the battle of Tanga and was twice mentioned in dispatches for gallantry in action. During the war, he offered two seven-seater touring-body motor vehicles for ambulance work or other purposes. They were equipped with tools, spares, and lamps. He founded the Nishan-i-Sardari and Tamgha-i-Liaqat-i-Khidmat in August 1918.
He died on 19 November 1930 and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Haider Khan.
