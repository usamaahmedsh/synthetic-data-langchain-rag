== Timeline ==


=== November 1943 ===
In the nights between 22 and 23 November 1943, in Bajčetina, the battalion of Vase Jeličića surrounded the house of long-wanted Chetnik commander Miodrag Basarić who killed 2 SDK members and several Germans in April 1943. Basarić barely escaped and his companion Miodrag Arsenijević was killed, however in Bajčetina they found him and after a short fight he was seriously wounded. Basarić eventually killed himself to avoid capture. His body was transferred and put in Čestin, in front of the church so it could scare people. Three Chetniks were also captured and shortly after were executed. In autumn 1943, Chetniks carried out raids and liquidations against Germans and SDK members. As a result of these actions, Marisav Petrovic's mistress and several others were killed. Enraged, Marisav hired his associate Vasa Jelicic to take action against Djorić, commander of the second Kragujevac brigade. At the end of November 1943, Djorić was encircled and captured with his fellow soldiers. On 26 November, Pavle Djorić was executed by the Germans and then transferred and hanged with other Chetniks in the Kragujevac settlement of Sušica. At least 12 Chetniks were hanged.


=== January 1944 ===
The largest and most serious attack was carried out by the SDK with Jelicic on Captain Mirko Smiljanic on January 13 and 14, 1944 in Donje Komarice, Kragujevac. The attack was well planned through Ljotić's informants, and for the action itself, Jelicić chose the best people, with exclusively automatic weapons. First, the soldiers, dressed in peasant clothes, disarmed the Chetnik guards, and then they surrounded them and attacked them with all their force. At one point, Smiljanić jumped out of the window but got shot in both legs. Soon after, surviving Chetniks were defeated. 18 Chetniks and collaborators  were captured, one of them being Mirko's brother, Branko and Mirko's wife, Olivera. The soldiers left their 9 month old baby in the nearest house. After these events 18 chetniks including Smiljanić himself were executed.


=== February 1944 ===
In the second half of February, Marisav and his battalion organized an ambush on Duke Nikola Kalabić and his entourage, who were retreating from the Germans. All eight guardsmen were killed, but it was Nikola Kalabić's predecessor. The dead Chetniks were dragged out onto the road by the soldiers, but they also took people out of their houses to see them. Jelicic, furious that he did not kill Kalabic, started kicking the dead Chetniks.


=== May 1944 ===
On May 10, SDK members organised an ambush and killed Dragutin Janković. The number of times that the Chetniks attempted to assassinate Vasa Jeličić is not known. The Chetniks tried to kill him on the day of the village processions, but he and about thirty SDK soldiers intervened among the people. Parts of the Lepemic Brigade, closest to the village, attacked and in battle pushed the soldiers to the village cemetery. Jeličić succeeded in escaping, leaving behind his fellow soldiers making this yet another failed assassination attempt.
