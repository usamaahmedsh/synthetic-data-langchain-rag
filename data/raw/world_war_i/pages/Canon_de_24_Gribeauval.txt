The Canon de 24 Gribeauval was a French 24-pounder cannon and part of the Gribeauval system developed by Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. It was part of the siege artillery.
The canon de 24 Gribeauval was used extensively during the wars following the French Revolution, as well as the Napoleonic Wars.
Some of the earlier Gribeauval siege guns kept the baroque "dolphin" design for the handles.
