The General Government of Galicia and Bukovina, also known as the Galicia Governorate-General (Russian: Галицийское генерал-губернаторство, romanized: Galitsiyskoye general-gubernatorstvo) was a temporary Russian military administration of the eastern parts of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, which were captured from Austria-Hungary during World War I.
The administration was established after the Russian victory in the Battle of Galicia, led by the commander-in-chief Nikolai Ivanov in the late summer of 1914. It did not last long, and by mid-1915, the Russians retreated after the Gorlice–Tarnów offensive led by the Central Powers overall commander August von Mackensen. During the later stages of the war, Russian forces tried to reclaim the territory during the Brusilov and the Kerensky offensives. Although it de facto ceased to function after the Great Retreat in 1915, it was not formally abolished until 1917.
