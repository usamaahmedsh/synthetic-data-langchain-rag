The Battle of Sultanabad (Persian: نبرد سلطان‌آباد) occurred on February 13, 1812, between the Russian Empire and the Persian Empire. In the resulting battle, the Russians were surrounded and routed. 
The Persians, numerically superior, were led by Abbas Mirza and fought the Russians. A Persian offensive into Georgia, with Persia's British and French-trained Nezam-e Jadid infantry, initiated the battle. The Persians had also obtained European cannons from the French.
The Persians won the battle by moving faster than the Russians and by attacking them near their camp with the reformed European-style infantry. However, the Battle of Aslanduz and the Siege of Lankaran followed soon after, shifting the momentum of the war firmly in Russia's favor.
The battle is considered the most shameful page of the war for the Russians
