Ayuka or Ayuki Khan (Mongolian: Аюук Хан, romanized: Ayuuk Khan; 1669–1724) was a Kalmyk leader under whose rule the Kalmyk Khanate reached its zenith in terms of economic, military, and politic power. On behalf of Russia, Ayuka Khan protected the southern borders of Russia, engaging in many military expeditions against the Muslim tribes of Central Asia, the North Caucasus and Crimea.

For the latter war, to honor his service, he received a golden sword and a belt covered with precious stones by Peter I.
