The Battle of Khanaqin was fought during World War I which took place in modern-day Iraq. This battle was the only Russian engagement fought by the Russian Army on the Mesopotamian Front of World War I. The battle likely took place on 4 June 1916, however, some sources state that it took place on 3 June 1916. Baghdad commander Khalil Pasha dispatched Ali İhsan Bey's XIII Corps to meet and drive the Russian force back from Khanaqin to prepare for a proposed invasion of Persia en route to attacking British rear positions. Before this battle, General Baratov previously attempted to capture Khanaqin on 7 May 1916. Although the Ottomans won the Battle of Khanaqin, the United Kingdom used the advantage of the distracted Ottoman forces to conquest Baghdad. After Ali İhsan Bey was called away from Khanaqin to return to Baghdad in February 1917 in an unsuccessful attempt to combat the invading British forces, the Russians occupied the city of Khanaqin.
