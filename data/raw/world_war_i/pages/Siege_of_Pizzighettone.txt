The siege of Pizzighettone was the first major military engagement of the northern Italian campaigns of the War of the Polish Succession.  
Troops from France and the Kingdom of Sardinia began blockading the Habsburg Milanese fortress at Pizzighettone on 11 November 1733, commencing siege operations on 15 November.  On 30 November the commander of the Austrian garrison negotiated a capitulation in which he promised to withdraw toward Mantua on 9 December if no relief arrived.  As no reinforcements appeared by that time, the fortress' garrison withdrew with full honors on 9 December.
