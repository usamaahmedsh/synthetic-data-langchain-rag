Bac u kry is an Albanian slogan which was used during Kosovo's independence from Serbia in February 2008. It means "Uncle, it's over".
The slogan was also used on T-shirts, pens and posters. The creators of this phrase say that this symbolizes the independence which many ethnic Albanians dreamt for since the end of the Kosovo War in 1999.
The slogan often accompanies the face of Adem Jashari, an ethnic Albanian commander during the Kosovo War who was killed in action.
