The Sardinian Crimean War Medal or, more formally, the silver medal for Military Valour for the Eastern Expedition 1855–1856 (Italian: Medaglia d’Argento al Valor Militare per la spedizione d’Oriente 1855–1856) was a gallantry medal awarded by King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia for bravery during the Crimean War (1855–1856) against the Russian Empire. It is a variant of the Sardinian Medal of Military Valor.
