Battle of Miserere occurred during the second British invasion of the Río de la Plata between the British troops at the command of John Whitelocke, and the Spanish forces commanded by Santiago de Liniers. The confrontation took place on 2 July 1807 in the current Miserere square, Balvanera neighborhood, Buenos Aires. The British troops prevailed, but General Gower discouraged further advances, and gave orders to Colonel Crauford to stop the pursuit of the defeated, allowing them to entrench themselves in the city.
