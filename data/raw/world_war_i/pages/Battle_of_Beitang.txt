The Battle of Beitang, during the Boxer Rebellion, was fought on September 20, 1900, between the Eight Nation Alliance and the Great Qing army.


== Background ==
Beitang is 5 mi (8.0 km) north of Tianjin. It was necessary to capture Beitang for organising railway connection between Tianjin and Manchuria.
During the night, Russian troops captured a Chinese position near the destroyed Beitang railway station, and built several batteries. In the morning, Russian and German cannons began to bombard the fortress, and at 10 a.m. the Chinese garrison fled. At noon, the fortress was captured without fighting.
