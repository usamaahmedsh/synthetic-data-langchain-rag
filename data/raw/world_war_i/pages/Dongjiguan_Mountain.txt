Dongjiguan Mountain (Chinese: 东鸡冠山, meaning "East Cockscomb Mountain")  or Tongchikuan Mountain is a hill in Lushunkou District, Dalian, Liaoning, China. The Imperial Russian Army built a fort on the north side of this mountain to defend the Lüshun Naval Port.
During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the Japanese Imperial Army, after several unsuccessful assaults, conquered it in December 1904, one month before the ceasefire. The Russian General Roman Kondratenko was killed in one of these assaults.
Dongjiguan Mountain is now part of the Dongjiguan Mountain Scenic Area where visitors can learn the history of the Russo-Japanese War.
