The song is arranged for piano and vocals, and is set to a slow tempo. The lyrics are told from the point of view of a soldier's sweetheart who says farewell to him as he departs for the war. She is anxious about her lover's safety, but tells him to "never fear." The speaker tells him she will think of him while he is far away fighting for liberty.
