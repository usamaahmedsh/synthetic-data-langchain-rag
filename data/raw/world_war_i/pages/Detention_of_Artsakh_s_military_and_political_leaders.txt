The capture of military and political leaders of the former Republic of Artsakh took place on September 19, 2023, following a military offensive by the Azerbaijani Armed Forces in the region and the events that followed. Azerbaijani border guards detained several prominent figures, including former State Minister Ruben Vardanyan, former Defense Army Commander Levon Mnatsakanyan, former Deputy Commander of the Defense Army Davit Manukyan, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Davit Babayan, Speaker of the National Assembly Davit Ishkhanyan, and former Presidents of Artsakh Arkadi Ghukasyan, Bako Sahakyan, and Araik Harutyunyan. Russian military forces did not intervene in their detention in September 2023. The Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the arrests of the former leadership of Artsakh and addressed the issue to the International Court of Justice.

== Reactions and calls for release ==


=== Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) ===
According to former Artsakh Interior Minister Karen Sargsyan, the political and military leaders stayed in Artsakh until the last person left, not fleeing before the population.


=== Armenia ===
The Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the return of Armenian prisoners of war, civilians, and former leaders of Artsakh a priority.  On January 25, 2025, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that Armenian prisoners, including the former leaders of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, were being subjected to the administration of psychotropic drugs in Azerbaijan to extract confessions that could escalate tensions in the region and be used against Armenia.


=== Azerbaijan ===
Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's administration has expressed a desire to ensure that the defeat of the Artsakh leadership is as humiliating as possible. Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ayhan Hajiyev stated that Azerbaijan is not obligated to release prisoners of war.


=== International Reactions ===
International actors, including officials from the United States and the European Union, have called for the humane treatment of Armenian prisoners and for their treatment in accordance with international law.
U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin urged Azerbaijani President Aliyev to release "those unjustly imprisoned by his government, including Armenian detainees."
Jared Genser, an international human rights lawyer specializing in political prisoners, stated that many actors in international courts are deeply concerned about the situation in Azerbaijan. He warned that attempts by Aliyev to avoid responsibility for the situation could lead to significant reputational damage.
On January 29, 2025, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution calling on Azerbaijan to release the former military and political leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh and all other Armenian prisoners of war.


== Analysis ==
According to political analyst Laurence Broers, the trials of the Armenian leaders from Artsakh are likely to be used as a media spectacle by Azerbaijan to promote its viewpoint on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
