== Poem by Alexey Tolstoy ==
Alexander Timashev was the hero of the satirical poem by Alexey Tolstoy "History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev", written in the year of his appointment as Minister of Internal Affairs (1868). The humorously exaggerated figure of the minister, as presented by Tolstoy, crowns the thousand–year–old Russian history and finally brings the "order" that was absent in Russia all this time, about which the narrator narrates in the "chronicle syllable":
