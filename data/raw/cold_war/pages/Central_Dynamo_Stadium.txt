Dynamo Stadium, designed by the architects Arkadiy Langman and Lazar Cherikover, dates from 1928. In 1938 the Dinamo station of the Moscow Metro opened nearby. An athletics track circles the football field, but is no longer in use. A monument to Lev Yashin (1929–1990) stands at the stadium's north entrance and VIP boxes are positioned above the entrances to the north and south stands. In 2008 the stadium celebrated its 80-year anniversary.
Michael Jackson brought his HIStory World Tour to Dynamo Stadium in 1996 and Deep Purple performed there the same year.
