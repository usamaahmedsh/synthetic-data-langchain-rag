Portugal competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States.
A delegation of thirty eight competitors participated in eleven sports, bringing home a total of three medals – a feat only repeated 20 years later, in Athens – including Portugal's first ever Olympic gold medal, through Carlos Lopes in the marathon. Rosa Mota, future marathon olympic champion, was the bronze medalist of this event, who appeared for the first time in the Olympics.
Portugal made its debut in the Olympic archery as well as in the diving, with Joana Figueiredo as the first Portuguese Olympic diver. Female competitors were also present at the first rhythmic gymnastics events in an Olympiad.
