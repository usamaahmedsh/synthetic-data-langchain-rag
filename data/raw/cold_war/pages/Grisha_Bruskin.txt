Grisha Bruskin (full name Григо́рий Дави́дович Бру́скин, Grigórij Davídovich Brúskin, born October 21, 1945)  is a Russian artist known as a painter, sculptor, and printmaker.
He was born in Moscow. Between 1963 and 1968, he studied at the Moscow Textile Institute (Art Department). In 1969, he became a member of the Artists' Union of the USSR. Bruskin's participation in the famous Sotheby's auction in Moscow (1988) brought him worldwide fame when his piece Fundamental Lexicon was sold for a record price.
He relocated to New York in 1988. In 1999, at the invitation of the German government and as a representative of Russia, Bruskin created a monumental triptych, Life Above All, for the reconstructed Reichstag in Berlin. In 2001 he published a memoir-style book, Past Imperfect. In 2012 he received the Kandinsky Prize in the "Project of the Year" category, for his project, H-Hour. Bruskin lives and works in New York and Moscow. He is one of the best-known and most successful contemporary artists of Russian origins.
