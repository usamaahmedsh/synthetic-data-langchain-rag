== Background ==
The Bhutan Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1983. Bhutan participation in the Games marked their debut appearance at the Summer Olympics. Bhutan has yet to win an Olympic medal. Archery is the country's national sport. It was declared the national sport in 1971, when the country became a member of the United Nations.
The 1984 Summer Olympics were held from July 28 to August 12, 1984 in Los Angeles, United States. The Bhutanese delegation consisted of six archers. Thinley Dorji was chosen as the flag-bearer for the opening ceremony. The fact that women competed was controversial, due to traditional Bhutanese archery barring them to competing.
