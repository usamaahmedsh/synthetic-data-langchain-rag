"Reach Out" is a 1984 song by Giorgio Moroder, which was the designated theme for the track events at the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, United States  and sung by Paul Engemann. It was later included on Moroder's 1985 album Innovisions.


== Background ==
For the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, musical themes were commissioned for many of the sports. In recognition of Los Angeles' long association with the motion picture industry, most of the pieces were written by established film soundtrack composers, including Bill Conti, Philip Glass, Bob James, Quincy Jones, Giorgio Moroder and John Williams. Moroder was commissioned to provide the Track theme, and wrote "Reach Out" with two of his regular collaborators, singer Paul Engemann and guitarist Richie Zito. 
The song is an encouragement for the athletes to win.


== Music video ==
The music video does not contain any treatment and is made up of cut scenes with athletes. In the scenes the athletes swim, run a marathon and long jump and in between it, a medal is shown.
