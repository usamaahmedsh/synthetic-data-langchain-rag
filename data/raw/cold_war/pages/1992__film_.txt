=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 65% of 43 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale.
Randy Myers of the San Jose Mercury News said, "Genuine scenes between Gibson and Ammanuel, aid in making “1992” a genre exercise with much more on its mind than you might suspect." Jeremy K. Gover of the Untitled Film Project Podcast said, "Remove the historical context and 1992 still encompasses a remarkable story about race relations, intergenerational empathy, socioeconomic divides, moral navigation and family dynamics, all while being a solid heist film."
Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times wrote that "The look is drab, the action is barely coherent, and Liotta deserved to go out with a better line than 'I did the best that I could, son. I’m sorry it wasn’t enough'." A sentiment echoed by Roger Moore of Movie Nation, who felt that the film was "even straining to get to the label 'solid'."
Richard Whittaker of the Austin Chronicle in a mixed summary noted the "feel" of the period, but was disappointed that "the only element of Nineties Americana he (Vromen) really resurrects is the mediocre amoral crime flick", while other reviewers bemoaned the "glaring plot holes" and "Formulaic plotting".
