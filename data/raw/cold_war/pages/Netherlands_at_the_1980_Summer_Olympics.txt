The Netherlands competed at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR. In partial support of the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in protest over the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, the Dutch athletes boycotted the Opening Ceremony, and the Olympic Flag was used in place of Netherlands' national flag at medal ceremonies. 75 competitors, 57 men and 18 women, took part in 56 events in 10 sports.
