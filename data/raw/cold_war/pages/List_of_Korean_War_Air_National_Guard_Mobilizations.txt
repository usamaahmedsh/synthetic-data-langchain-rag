Air National Guard (ANG) units of the United States Air Force began to be mobilized in October 1950 when President Harry S. Truman issued federalization orders, bringing ANG units under federal control.  Eventually, some 45,000 Air Guardsmen, about 80 percent of the force, were mobilized.  Initially mobilized units were deployed to Far East Air Forces (FEAF) for combat operations in Korea.  Other mobilized units were deployed to Europe to reinforce United States Air Forces in Europe.
Beginning in Feb 1951, mobilized units were assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC), Strategic Air Command (SAC) and Tactical Air Command (TAC), replacing or augmenting active-duty units.  Later many ANG personnel and equipment were redeployed from their active-duty units as individual filler replacements to FEAF as required, being assigned to various combat units as replacements.  Guardsmen began to be demobilized in Jul 1952, with their units being inactivated by the active-duty air force.   Subsequently, the individual state Air National Guard bureaus re-activated and re-formed the units beginning in Jan 1953.
