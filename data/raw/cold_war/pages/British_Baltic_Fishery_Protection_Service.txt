The British Baltic Fishery Protection Service (BBFPS) was a front organization of the British intelligence service MI6. It was founded in 1949 - ostensibly to monitor the fisheries within the maritime borders of the British occupation zone in the Baltic Sea as a part of the Royal Navy, but in reality to carry out covert operations in the Baltic region.
