== History ==


=== Ship's building. ===
After the Kherson Shipyard restoration had been completed on 12 December 1952. The tanker "Kherson" was the first large-tonnage ship and was delivered on 2 December 1952.
During 1957 the main efforts of the shipyard was directed to the construction of the first of a new line of merchant ships for the USSR. From the beginning the pre-production was delayed due to the backlog of the design work in the Nicholayev Central Design Buro "Chernomorsudoproekt", as well as receiving unsatisfactory ship building materials.
The komsomols and youth of Kherson Shipyard took patronage over the construction of the first cargo vessel in new class of ships and committed to pass this ship into operation to the 40th anniversary of Komsomol organization; that meant two months earlier than planned. Due to request of the komsomols and youth of Kherson Shipyard, the Ministry of the Merchant Fleet named this ship Leninsky Komsomol.
The construction of the head freighter begun in the metalworking shop in June 1957. Sectional assembly shop mastered the construction of large sections weighing up to 100 tons. In addition, some problems were created due to the mistakes that were made in the manufacture of the rigging, as well as poorly assembled beds used as support for large sections of the ship.
A change in leadership at the Kherson shipyard occurred in August 1958: the director of the shipyard IG Anatsky I.G. was transferred to work in the Kherson Economic Council, as well as former chief technology officer of the Black Sea Shipyard Zakharov A.N. was appointed the Kherson shipyard director. The new director paid much attention to the construction of the Leninsky Komsomol. The volume of work on the freighter has increased more than 2 times as compared with the tanker.
