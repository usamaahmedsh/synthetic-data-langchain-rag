The equestrian events at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics included show jumping, dressage and eventing.
The equestrian sports were held primarily at Santa Anita Racetrack, which offered stabling for up to 2100 horses, a grandstand with almost 16000 seats, and was managed by experienced horsemen. Fairbanks Ranch Country Club in San Diego County hosted the endurance portions of the three-day event.
Horses were required to be at least six years old. Up to 14 riders and 22 horses were permitted per country. In total 157 entries from thirty nations (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Great Britain, Guatemala, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Puerto Rico, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, the Virgin Islands, and Yugoslavia) competed.
Due to the boycott, the Soviet Union and its satellite nations were absent, although that had no impact on the competition, as all of the top riders were from the competing nations.
