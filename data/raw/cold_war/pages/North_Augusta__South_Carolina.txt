== History ==

In the 1890s, James U. Jackson, the city's primary visionary, joined his brother Walter Jackson and a group of New York-based investors in founding the North Augusta Land Company. On March 24, 1890, the company purchased a 5,600 acres tract of land from Mattie Butler Mealing, who inherited the land from her father, Robert Butler. Additional parcel of lands were acquired, bringing the total to 6,500 acres. James traveled to New York several times to receive financial backing for the town and the construction of the Thirteen Street/Georgia Avenue Bridge (James U. Jackson Memorial Bridge).
The city was incorporated on April 11, 1906. Two earlier settlements preceded North Augusta: Campbelltown, founded in 1780 by John Hammond, son of Charles Hammond, and the antebellum city of Hamburg.
In the early 20th century, North Augusta was a popular vacation spot for northerners. Its popularity stemmed from its railroad connections and climate. The Hampton Terrace Hotel, a luxury resort built by the Jackson brothers and opened in 1903, contributed to North Augusta's early economic development by attracting affluent seasonal visitors until its destruction by fire on December 31, 1916.
In the mid-20th century after the atomic bomb and during the Cold War, the city's population nearly quadrupled because the Savannah River Plant was constructed south of town. During this period the area of North Augusta increased from 772 acres to 5,139 acres.
The Georgia Avenue-Butler Avenue Historic District, Charles Hammond House, Lookaway Hall (the residence of Walter Jackson), Britton Mims Place, Rosemary Hall (the residence of James U. Jackson), and B.C. Wall House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
North Augusta is also notable for nearby Murphy Village, a community of about 2,500 Irish Travelers that was featured on a 2012 episode of the TLC show, My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding.
