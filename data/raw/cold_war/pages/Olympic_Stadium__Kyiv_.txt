The Olympic Stadium (also known as Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex; Ukrainian: Національний спортивний комплекс "Олімпійський", romanized: Natsionalnyi sportyvnyi kompleks "Olimpiiskyi", IPA: [nɐts⁽ʲ⁾ioˈnɑlʲnɪj sporˈtɪu̯nɪj ˈkɔmpleks ol⁽ʲ⁾imˈpijsʲkɪj]) is a multi-use sports and recreation facility in Kyiv, Ukraine, located on the slopes of the city's central Cherepanova Hora (Cherepanov Hill), Pecherskyi District. The Olympic National Sports Complex Stadium is the premier sports venue in Ukraine and the sixteenth largest such venue in Europe. Although it is often used by FC Dynamo Kyiv for football matches, it is technically not the football club's home stadium. Since May 2020, the stadium has also been used for the home matches of Shakhtar Donetsk due to the war in Donbas. The complex beside its stadium also features several other sports facilities and is designed to host the Olympic Games (the stadium hosted some football matches at the 1980 Summer Olympics).
Following extensive renovation, including the construction of a new roof, the stadium was reopened on 9 October 2011 with a performance by Shakira, and had its international inauguration with a 3–3 friendly draw by Ukraine against Germany on 11 November 2011. It hosted the final of the UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final.


== History ==

Opened in 1923 as Leon Trotsky Red Stadium, the arena was built on the northwestern slopes of Cherepanova Hora hill and used remains of ruined buildings for parts of its structure. The initiative to create the stadium belonged to Lajos Gavro, at the time military commissar of Kiev Governorate. In 1924 a football field measuring 120 to 70 meters with a running track and changing rooms was established at the location. Until the construction of Dynamo Stadium, the arena remained the main football pitch in Kyiv.
Following the transfer of Ukrainian SSR's administrative capital from Kharkiv to Kyiv in 1934, the stadium was significantly expanded according to a project by architect Mykhailo Hrechyna. The opening of the new structure, decorated with a colonnade of 22 Corinthian columns and officially renamed N.S.Khrushchev Republican Stadium was scheduled for 22 June 1941, but was abandoned due to the start of the German-Soviet War on the same day.

Under German occupation the arena became known as the All-Ukrainian Stadium and reopened on 12 July 1942, hosting matches of several local and German teams. Although the stadium was never directly attacked by any of the sides, it was seriously damaged during the German retreat from Kyiv in November 1943 and could only be reopened seven months later with a football match between Dynamo Kyiv and CSKA Moscow, which had originally been scheduled for the opening of the arena back in 1941.
In the postwar years the stadium was reconstructed, receiving its first scoreboard, its entrance portal was completed, and in 1956 four 500-lux lighting masts with the height of 45 meters were installed. In October 1962 the arena became known as Central Stadium. In the next year a Hungarian-produced electronic scoreboard appeared. Another reconstruction took place from 1966, with a second tier being added to the stadium, which allowed it to host over 100,000 spectators. Specialized rooms for commentators' booths, two new electronic scoreboards and even a ski jump were added during that time.
In preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics, after 1977 the stadium underwent another reconstruction, receiving new drainage, an Olympic cauldron, a modernized lighting system with four 82-meter masts and various additional facilities. During that period the arena once again became known as the Republican Stadium.

After Ukrainian independence in 1991, the stadium was given national status in 1996 and renamed again as the "Olympic" National Sports Complex. Kyivans still commonly refer to it as the Tsentralny (Central) or Respublikanskyi stadion (Republican Stadium); the nearby metro station "Olimpiiska" was also initially called "Respublikanskyi Stadion".

In 1997–99, the stadium was renovated again in accordance with FIFA guidelines, and its capacity was reduced to 83,450. The stadium continued to serve as the home territory of Dynamo, with the Lobanovsky stadium serving as a training ground. Sometime after 1998, major changes took place, as it was no longer efficient to keep and maintain the stadium as a club ground. Dynamo decided to reconstruct the Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium as its primary ground, because match attendances rarely exceeded 10,000 spectators. Since that time, Olympic has been used primarily for football international matches, and it was lent to FC Dynamo Kyiv for high-profile home games when a high attendance was expected. However, it is not the official home ground of Dynamo or any other Kyiv club, as they all have smaller home stadiums and training bases. The stadium is an official home ground of the Ukraine national football team and was the official venue of the Ukrainian Cup final until 2008. In 2008, the stadium underwent a major reconstruction in preparation for the continental championship.

During the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election, the debate between then-incumbent Petro Poroshenko and eventual winner Volodymyr Zelenskyy was held in the Olympic Stadium.

=== Transportation ===
The stadium is located right in the centre of Kyiv on the right bank of the River Dnipro. The stadium can be approached mainly by either Velyka Vasylkivska Street or Lesi Ukrainki Boulevard. Both streets' southern ends connect to the European route E95, which is known at that part of the city as Druzhby Narodiv Boulevard. However the main arena of the complex does not have a direct access to the mentioned streets and can only be reached through several smaller streets such as Fizkultury, Saksahanskoho, Shota Rustaveli, Esplanadna Streets and Hospitalny Lane.
There are several subway stations on the Kyiv Metro located within walking distance: "Olimpiiska" (~300 metres (0.19 miles)) and "Palats Sportu" (~400 metres (0.25 miles)). These are usually closed during matches. It is possible to use other nearby stations Klovska, Zoloti Vorota, Teatralna, Palats "Ukrayina". In December 2010, Kyiv City State Administration renamed the subway station "Respublikansky Stadion" as "Olimpiiska".
