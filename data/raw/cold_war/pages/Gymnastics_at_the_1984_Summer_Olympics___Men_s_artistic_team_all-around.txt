These are the results of the men's team all-around competition, one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.  The compulsory and optional rounds took place on July 29 and 31 at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion.

== Results ==
The final score for each team was determined by combining all of the scores earned by the team on each apparatus during the compulsory and optional rounds. If all six gymnasts on a team performed a routine on a single apparatus during compulsories or optionals, only the five highest scores on that apparatus counted toward the team total.
