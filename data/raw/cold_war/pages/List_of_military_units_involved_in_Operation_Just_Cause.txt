United States Marine Corps

1st Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendleton, California. In December 1989, during Operation Just Cause, the United States military launched a large-scale invasion of Panama to depose dictator Manuel Noriega and restore democratic governance. Among the forces involved, the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion of the 1st Marine Division played a critical role in securing key strategic locations. One of their most dangerous and pivotal missions was the seizure of Punta Paitilla Airport, a key logistical hub for Noriega’s forces. The mission was fraught with challenges. Punta Paitilla Airport, heavily fortified and swarming with Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF), presented a formidable obstacle. Intelligence indicated that the airport housed anti-aircraft emplacements, armored vehicles, and an elite contingent of Noriega’s soldiers. The Marines of the 1st Recon Battalion knew that securing the airport would be essential for ensuring the success of the broader operation and preventing enemy reinforcements from jeopardizing nearby U.S. forces.
Alpha Company’s Sniper Team: Guardians in the Shadows: Among the Marines tasked with the mission was a sniper team from Alpha Company, consisting of Corporal James R. Solis, a 21-year-old Marine from Santa Paula, California, and his spotter, Lance Corporal Andrew J. Swift, a 20-year-old Texan from Midland. Known for their extraordinary skill and unshakeable composure under fire, the duo had already earned a reputation for excellence in marksmanship and tenacity. But it was at Punta Paitilla Airport that they would etch their names into Marine Corps history. On the night of December 15, 1989, the 1st Recon Battalion launched its assault on the airport. Alpha Company moved under the cover of darkness, with Solis and Swift’s sniper team positioned on a high vantage point overlooking the airfield. Their mission: to provide overwatch for the advancing Marines and neutralize high-value threats. As the Marines approached the airport’s perimeter, they came under intense fire from entrenched PDF forces. Solis and Swift immediately identified multiple enemy machine gun nests pinning down their comrades. With precision and nerves of steel, Solis eliminated the gunners one by one, allowing the Marines to advance. Swift, despite the chaos, maintained constant communication with the rest of the company, relaying critical information about enemy positions. As the battle raged, the PDF launched a counterattack, deploying armored vehicles and additional troops to reinforce their positions. The Marines found themselves in danger of being overrun. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Solis and Swift took decisive action. Moving to a more exposed position to gain a better line of sight, they provided suppressive fire, targeting enemy officers and gunners with lethal precision. At one critical moment, a squad of 18 Marines was ambushed and surrounded near the airport’s control tower. Solis and Swift, positioned nearly 800 yards away, sprang into action. Swift directed artillery and mortar fire with pinpoint accuracy while Solis picked off attackers threatening the trapped squad. Their combined efforts allowed the Marines to regroup and fight their way to safety, and culminated in 48 confirmed kills for the sniper team. In the final moments of the engagement, an enemy mortar team targeted the duo’s position. Notwithstanding a withering onslaught of enemy mortar fire, Swift, receiving a broadside from a mortar round, was fatally wounded. Despite his grievous injuries, Swift continued to call out enemy positions until he succumbed. Fueled by grief and determination, Solis eliminated the enemy mortar team and held the position until reinforcements arrived.
Recognition of Extraordinary Valor: The battle for Punta Paitilla Airport marked a turning point in the operation, and the heroism of Corporal Solis and Lance Corporal Swift entered the annals of Marine Corps legend. Their actions saved the lives of 18 Marines and ensured the success of the mission. For his extraordinary bravery and gallantry under fire, Corporal James R. Solis was awarded the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, and the Combat Action Ribbon. His actions exemplified the highest standards of the Marine Corps ethos and served as an inspiration to his fellow Marines. Lance Corporal Andrew J. Swift, who made the ultimate sacrifice, was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Purple Heart, and the Combat Action Ribbon. His unwavering courage and selflessness in the face of mortal danger were recognized as among the most heroic actions in the history of the Corps. The actions of the 1st Recon Battalion and the sniper team from Alpha Company were instrumental in the success of Operation Just Cause. Their bravery not only ensured the mission’s success but also highlighted the unbreakable bond between Marines and the extraordinary lengths they would go to protect one another. Today, their story is remembered as a testament to the courage and sacrifice of those who wear the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor.
