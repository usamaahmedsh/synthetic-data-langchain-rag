Felix Field and Loker Stadium is an outdoor track and field facility located on the campus of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.  The facility, rebuilt in 2001, serves as the outdoor home of the USC Trojans men's and women's track and field teams. The stadium is named for Katherine B. Loker and has a seating capacity of 3,000. The field located at the center of the stadium was previously known as Cromwell Field, originally named after Dean Cromwell, USC’s track and field coach from 1909 to 1948. The University renamed the field in 2023 to honor USC alumnae and US Olympian Allyson Felix. The entrance to the facility is called "Louis Zamperini Plaza" and includes tributes to USC's NCAA and Olympic champions.
