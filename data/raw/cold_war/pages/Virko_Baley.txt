Viroslav Petrovych Baley (born October 21, 1938, known by the diminutive Virko) is a Ukrainian-American composer, conductor, and pianist. He was born in Radekhiv in Poland (now in  Ukraine), the only child of Petro (Peter) and Lydia Baley. Petro Baley was sent to  Auschwitz concentration camp following the German invasion of Poland in 1939, and he and extended family were relocated to Slovakia. The family was reunited on a farm in Germany towards the end of the war to work as farm laborers, after which they relocated to Munich. From 1947 to 1949, the family lived in a displaced person's camp in Regensburg, Germany.
Baley began his formal music training in Germany. He studied at the Los Angeles Conservatory (renamed the California Institute of the Arts).

He also co-directs Nevada Encounters of New Music, and collaborates with the New Juilliard Ensemble in New York. Baley composed the score to the 1991 Ukrainian film Swan Lake, The Zone.
In Spring 2007, Baley was commissioned by the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University to write his opera Hunger.
As a producer, and through his record label TNC, Virko Baley has released a series of compact discs containing rare recordings of the pianist Sviatoslav Richter and of the Cleveland Chamber Symphony, the latter earning him a Grammy Award.
