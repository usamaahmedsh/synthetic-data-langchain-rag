The Republic of Upper Volta (French: République de Haute-Volta) was a landlocked West African country established on 11 December 1958 as a self-governing state within the French Community. Before becoming autonomous, it had been part of the French Union as the French Upper Volta. On 5 August 1960, it gained full independence from France. On 4 August 1984, it changed its name to Burkina Faso.


== Etymology ==

The name Upper Volta indicated that the country contains the upper part of the Volta River.


== History ==
Upper Volta obtained independence on 5 August 1960, with Maurice Yaméogo of the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) becoming the country's first president. A constitution was ratified the same year, establishing presidential elections by direct universal suffrage and a National Assembly, both with five-year terms. Shortly after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV-RDA. He had shown a deep authoritarian streak even before becoming president. Between the time he became prime minister of Upper Volta while it was still a French colony and independence two years later, opposition parties were subjected to increased harassment.
On 3 January 1966, Yaméogo was overthrown in a coup d'état led by army chief Sangoulé Lamizana. Although multiparty democracy was nominally restored four years later, Lamizana dominated the country's politics until he was himself overthrown in 1980.
After a series of short-term presidencies, Thomas Sankara then came to power through yet another military coup d'état on 4 August 1983. After the coup, he formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with himself as president. Under the direction of Sankara, the country changed its name on 4 August 1984, from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, which means "Land of Incorruptible People".


== Politics ==
From 1958 to 1960, the Republic of Upper Volta was led by a high commissioner:

Max Berthet (11 December 1958 to February 1959),

From 1971 to 1987, the Republic of Upper Volta was led by a prime minister:

== Symbols ==


=== Flag ===

The colours of the national flag corresponded to the names of the Volta's three main tributaries: the Black Volta, the White Volta and the Red Volta.


=== National Hymn ===

This anthem was replaced in 1984 by a new anthem, the Ditanyè.


== Cultural references ==
During the 1960s, the Soviet Union was sometimes derisively referred to as "Upper Volta with rockets", coined by a journalist Xan Smiley, referencing USSR's disproportion of defence sector over relatively undeveloped civilian economy.
