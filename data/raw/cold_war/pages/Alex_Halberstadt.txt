Young Heroes of the Soviet Union, his family memoir, was named a New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice and excerpted in The New Yorker. Writing in The New York Times, critic Jennifer Szalai called it "a loving and mournful account that’s also skeptical, surprising and often very funny," adding, "it’s the unexpected specificity of Halberstadt’s observations that ultimately make this memoir as lush and moving as it is.“
Halberstadt's critically acclaimed biography, Lonely Avenue: the Unlikely Life and Times of Doc Pomus, was named a New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice and a Best Book of 2007 by The Times (London). Ben Folds and Nick Hornby cited it as an inspiration for their collaborative album Lonely Avenue.
