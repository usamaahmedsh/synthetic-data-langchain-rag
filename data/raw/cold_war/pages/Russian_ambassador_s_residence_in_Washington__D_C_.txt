== History ==
Built in 1910 to the designs of architectural firm Wyeth & Sullivan, the building is three and a half stories high and is made of brick bearing walls with steel floor and roofing members. The building permit estimated the cost at $125,000, whereas the completed house ended up costing $361,000 in 1910. 
The building was built at the request of Mrs. George Pullman for her daughter Florence Pullman, who was married to Illinois House Representative Frank O. Lowden. Due to Frank Lowden's deteriorating health he left Washington in the spring of 1911, and Mrs. Florence Pullman - who never moved into the house - sold it in 1913 to her friend Natalie Hammond.
In 1913 the house was sold to Russia for $350,000 to serve as the Russian Embassy during the reign of Nicholas II. Ambassador George Bakhmeteff became its first occupant.
From 1933 until 1979, the building served as the Soviet Union Embassy.  In 1979, the embassy began its transition to its current location on Wisconsin Avenue.  Since 1994, it has served as the residence for the Russian ambassador in Washington, D.C.
