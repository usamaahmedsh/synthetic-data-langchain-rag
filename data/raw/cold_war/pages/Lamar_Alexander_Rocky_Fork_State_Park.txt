Lamar Alexander Rocky Fork State Park (RFSP) is a 2,265 acres (9.17 km2) state park in Unicoi County in East Tennessee. It is situated in the Blue Ridge region of the Appalachian Mountains, close to the Tennessee-North Carolina state line.  The park is adjacent to the Cherokee National Forest, and it is in close proximity to the Appalachian Trail.  The Sampson Mountain Wilderness is also nearby.
Rocky Fork State Park was established in 2013, and facilities have not been developed, however the park does have a ranger station and gift shop located outside the park in the Flag Pond community.
Hiking and mountain biking are permitted on a network of old road beds, and fishing is allowed in Rocky Fork and South Indian Creeks, below and downstream of the State Park Main Entrance Gate.
The park was renamed from "Rocky Fork State Park" in January 2019 in honor of then-Senator Lamar Alexander, who was in his last term.
