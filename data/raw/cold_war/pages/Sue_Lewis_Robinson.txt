=== Federal judicial service ===
Robinson was a United States magistrate judge of the District of Delaware from 1988 to 1991. On October 1, 1991, Robinson was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Delaware vacated by Judge Jane Richards Roth.

=== Deshaun Watson arbitration ===
Robinson acted as an arbiter in the punishment of Deshaun Watson by the NFL. Robinson weighed evidence and evaluated the NFL's previous rulings on sexual assault cases and first-time offenders according to the NFL's own policy to decide on an appropriate suspension. Robinson concluded that the NFL proved its case that Watson leveraged his position as an NFL player to perform sexual acts without consent. Robinson handed down the minimum six-game suspension for Watson on August 1, 2022.
Two days later on August 3, the NFL filed an appeal of the suspension. The appeal was dismissed by the mutual consent of the parties following a settlement that increased the suspension to an eleven-game term.
