Denham Place is a Grade I listed 17th-century country house in Denham, Buckinghamshire. Surrounded by a Grade II listed 18th-century landscape park, the estate borders the Buckinghamshire Golf Club. 


== History ==


=== Origins ===
The house was constructed in 1688–1701 for Sir Roger Hill, and the architect was probably William Stanton. It was surrounded on three sides by elaborate formal gardens inspired by Versailles, which contained a canal and sculptures.
In 1773, most of the gardens were removed and replaced by a landscape park enclosed by a 10ft wall and encompassing a meadow, orchard, ornamental trees, formal sunken garden, flowerbeds, walled garden and a lake; Capability Brown created the layout.


=== Owners and visitors ===
Notable residents included members of the Bonaparte family, the American banker J. P. Morgan, the politician and movie financier Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart and the producer Harry Saltzman. Saltzman co-produced the first nine James Bond films at nearby Pinewood Studios, and later owners claimed the filmmakers used the house's library as M's office in the films Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun.
Notable visitors of the estate included producer Albert Broccoli, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Michael Caine, Rudolf Nureyev and Gregory Peck. 


=== Recent years ===

The property is owned by the Jatania family, which acquired the house from the cigarette manufacturer Rothmans International. In 2023, it was listed for sale at £75 million, making it one of the most expensive properties outside of London. Described as “a private palace”, the 28,525 sq ft main house has “state room-style principal entertaining spaces” as well as catering kitchens, a private chapel, two staircases and an elevator. Later being listed for sale at £65 million, it was listed for £45 million as of February 2025.
