Legislative definitions of an agency of the federal government of the United States are varied, and even contradictory. The official United States Government Manual offers no definition. While the Administrative Procedure Act definition of "agency" applies to most executive branch agencies, Congress may define an agency however it chooses in enabling legislation, and through subsequent litigation often involving the Freedom of Information Act and the Government in the Sunshine Act. These further cloud attempts to enumerate a list of agencies.
The executive branch of the federal government includes the Executive Office of the President and the United States federal executive departments (whose secretaries belong to the Cabinet). Employees of the majority of these agencies are considered civil servants.
The majority of the independent agencies of the United States government are also classified as executive agencies (they are independent in that they are not subordinated under a Cabinet position). There are a small number of independent agencies that are not considered part of the executive branch, such as the Congressional Research Service and the United States Sentencing Commission, which are legislative and judicial agencies, respectively.


== United States Congress ==

The U.S. Congress is the bicameral legislature of the United States government, and is made up of two chambers: the United States Senate (the upper chamber) and the United States House of Representatives (the lower chamber). Together, the two chambers exercise authority over the following legislative agencies:

The legislature also oversees the Library of Congress (LOC), a national library dedicated to national records, which administers various programs, agencies, and services including:

Law Library of Congress
Congressional Research Service (CRS)
United States Copyright Office (USCO) and the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB)

United States District Courts
United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
United States Court of International Trade
United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review
United States Alien Terrorist Removal Court
The Bankruptcy Courts, while not established as Article III courts, are legally designated as "units of the district courts." 
The judicial branch includes the following agencies:

Federal Judicial Center
Federal Public Defender Organizations
Judicial Conference of the United States
