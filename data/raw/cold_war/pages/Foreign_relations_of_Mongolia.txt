Mongolia has diplomatic relations with all 192 UN states, the Holy See, the State of Palestine and the European Union.
Its geopolitical position is defined by its geographical location, situated between Russia and China, relying on trade with both sides. Officially, it maintains a neutral stance on international matters. It has a modest number of missions abroad.
