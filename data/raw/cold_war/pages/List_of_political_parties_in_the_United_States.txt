This list of political parties in the United States, both past and present, does not include independents.
Not all states allow the public to access voter registration data. Therefore, voter registration data should not be taken as the correct value and should be viewed as an underestimate.
The abbreviations given come from state ballots used in the most recent elections and from the parties themselves. Not all political parties have abbreviations.
Party ballot access comes from a variety of sources including Ballotpedia and the websites of various state Secretaries of State.
