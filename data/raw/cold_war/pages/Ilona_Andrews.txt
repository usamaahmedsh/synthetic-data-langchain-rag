== Early lives ==


=== Ilona Gordon ===
Ilona Gordon was born in the Soviet Union. She was a gifted student, frequently participating in state-sponsored academic Olympiads. As a result of a cultural exchange trip to the USA as a teenager, and despite her limited English, she received a full scholarship to attend Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School, a boarding school in the state of Georgia.  She continued to excel there, eventually enrolling at Western Carolina University, where she majored in biochemistry and met Andrew Gordon.


=== Andrew Gordon ===
Andrew Beauregard Gordon was born in Florida, U.S., and grew up in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina, where he was raised by his aunt and uncle.
Gordon, as he is known, served four years in the United States Navy as a communications officer, then attended Western Carolina University to study history and political science.


=== Relationship ===
Ilona and Gordon met in a writing course at WCU in early 1994. They began collaborating and editing one another's school work, eventually writing their first novel together, which has not been published.
The couple married in August 1995.


== Career ==
Ilona returned to writing as a hobby after dropping out of college to stay at home with her first child. She began writing what would become their first novel as early as 2002, but went through multiple edits and various cycles of rejection. One publisher said it was too similar to the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series by Laurell K. Hamilton. Gordon helped Ilona rewrite one of her discarded submissions into Lost Dog which was eventually accepted and published as Magic Bites (2007).

After the instant success of their 2021 self-published novel Blood Heir, Andrews announced they would take a year off from traditional publishing to focus on self publishing, as their audience was now large enough to make it financially sustainable.


=== Writing Process ===
Ilona and Gordon generally write side by side, with two chairs at one computer. Ilona will write the first draft of lines of female characters, and Gordon the lines of the male characters. They plot out fight scenes together, drawing on Gordon's experience in judo. Gordon described writing together like marriage: "You have to realize the other person has strengths that compensate for your weaknesses."
Their writing is heavily inspired by world mythology; Gordon had studied history and mythology and Ilona grew up hearing Slavic folk tales. They find new sources of material by visiting used book stores.
