Johnson Kere is a sprinter from the Solomon Islands.
Kere was a member of the first ever team that the Solomon Islands sent to the Olympics when they competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics which were held in Los Angeles. He competed in the 100 metres and finished 7th in his heat, so failed to advance to the next round.
