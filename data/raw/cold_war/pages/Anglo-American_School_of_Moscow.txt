AAS Moscow, formally known as Anglo-American School of Moscow (Russian: Англо-американская школа в Москве, romanized: Anglo-amerikanskaya shkola v Moskvye) in Moscow, Russia, was an independent, non-profit, co-educational, international day school catering for students between the ages of 4 and 18 (Pre-kindergarten to Grade 12). On May 12, 2023, AAS announced that it would permanently be closing the AAS NKO organization and not seek further pathways for future operations.
AAS Moscow was founded in 1949 to serve the educational needs of diplomatic children who could not attend Soviet schools at the time.
It was located a few miles northwest of downtown Moscow in the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo District. AAS Moscow delivered an international standards-based curriculum aligned to recommendations of US professional associations. Grade 11 and 12 students could opt into the DP IB International Baccalaureate program and the Primary Years Program (PYP) was the focus for younger children.
During the 2018–19 school year, AAS had 1200 students from 60 nationalities; the majority U.S. Americans as a diplomatic school. As of 2021, AAS Moscow was no longer a diplomatic school. AAS was then a not-for-profit, fully accredited organization through New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) and it had the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) authorization for the PYP and DP learning.
AAS Moscow had approximately 250 students from 15 nationalities. 37% of the student demographic were Russian, 14% South Korean, 13.5% from the United States, 6% Indian, and the rest range from Turkey, Kazakhstan, China, and Colombia.
The school was fully accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, the Council of International Schools, and the International Baccalaureate Organization. It was also a member of the National Association of Independent Schools, the European Council of International Schools, and the Central and Eastern European Schools Association.
