== Federal judicial service ==
Martin was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Martin was nominated by President George H. W. Bush on January 24, 1990, to a seat vacated by Edward Weinfeld. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 5, 1990, and received his commission on April 6, 1990. He assumed senior status on May 31, 2003. Martin served in that capacity until September 30, 2003, due to retirement.


== Post-judicial career ==
After retiring as a US District Judge, he joined Debevoise & Plimpton LLP as of counsel from 2003 to November 2006. In December 2004, amidst growing concerns about Vioxx's cardiovascular risks, Merck paid $21 million for Martin Jr. and his colleagues at Debevoise & Plimpton to investigate. In September 2006, "The Martin Report" was released and found no evidence of wrongdoing by senior management, though it noted errors such as a statistician changing a methodology used to analyze trial results. Merck was satisfied with the report; however, the report faced criticism from some in the press as self-serving. In 2006, Martin joined the firm Martin & Obermaier after leaving Debevoise & Plimpton. He retired from regular practice in September 2020, but continues to perform arbitration and consult on complex litigation.
