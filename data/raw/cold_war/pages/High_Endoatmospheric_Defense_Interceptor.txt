High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor (HEDI) was an atmospheric missile defense layer developed for the Strategic Defense Initiative, along with Exoatmospheric Reentry-vehicle Interceptor Subsystem. It consisted of a two-stage launch vehicle (booster) and an infrared homing kill vehicle with a conventional warhead. Hughes Aircraft and Aerojet were contractors, and McDonnell Douglas was the system integrator.
The HEDI aimed to employ ground-based missiles to intercept submarine-launched ballistic missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles and operate in the high endoatmosphere region in order to destroy them.
