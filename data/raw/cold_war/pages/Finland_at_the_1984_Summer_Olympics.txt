== Medalists ==


== Archery ==

Defending gold medallist Tomi Poikolainen bettered his performance of four years earlier by one point, but with the return of the United States and Japan, Poikolainen's score was no longer sufficient to earn a medal and he fell to fifth place.  Much the same fate befell Päivi Meriluoto, who fell two places even though she shot 60 points better than she had in 1980.
Kyösti Laasonen, in his fourth Olympic archery competition, took 28th place.
