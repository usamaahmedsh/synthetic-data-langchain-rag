== History ==

The city, originally a whistle-stop of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, was first named Weeks.  The city took its present name in 1886 in honor of St. Louis Browns catcher Albert J. "Doc" Bushong. Following the Browns' victory in the 1886 World Series over the Chicago White Stockings, the Missouri Pacific Railroad honored several of the St. Louis players by naming some of their depots after the players. Bushong had played every game in the series and was at bat in Game Six, when the winning run scored by stealing home.  The city of Bushong is the only one still carrying its name from the 1886 World Series.
During the Cold War, Bushong was the location of one of the first generations of nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles.  The site, active from 1961–1965, was part of the 548th Strategic Missile Squadron.
