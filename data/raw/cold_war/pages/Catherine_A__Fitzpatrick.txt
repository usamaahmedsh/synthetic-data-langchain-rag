== Criticism of Mitt Romney's digital campaign team ==
Following President Barack Obama's reelection in November 2012, Fitzpatrick penned an entry on her own blog in which she alleged that Republican challenger Mitt Romney's campaign's "ORCA" digital operation had failed because Targeted Victory, the company responsible for much of its online and digital strategy had employed African-American developers who she alleged to have favored the Obama campaign and whose politics was deliberately reflected as bugs left in their work—a hypothesis she based in part on the fact that the developers belonged to ethnic minorities statistically more likely to support Obama, and that one of them had previously been a developer for Al Gore. She later updated her blog to note that the developers in question had not worked on the ORCA project, but on other digital media-related areas of the campaign. Fitzpatrick is a registered member of the Democratic Party.
