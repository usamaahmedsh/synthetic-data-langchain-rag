== Background ==
Mosh was born in what was then the Soviet Union, but moved to the United States with her family at the age of three. She trained in gymnastics for more than 10 years in school and was a cheerleader in high school, but injured her elbow in her first year as an acrobat. This limited her movement, and soon she began developing an interest in fetishwear, bondage, and pinup photography, She later undertook alternative and fetish modeling and performed burlesque.


== Career ==
Mosh began building her modeling portfolio at the age of 17, networking on Modelmayhem.com to set up photo shoots with local photographers while juggling high school, a job and an internship. She learned how to do her own styling and makeup, partially out of financial necessity, which led to the development of her self-styled signature look. After some years of modeling, Mosh began to combine her tease and fetish aesthetics with her gymnastic experience from her childhood, becoming a burlesque and fetish performer.
Her fetishes include latex, corsets, stockings, ropes, and more. She operated a subscription website, which offered members-only photos, videos, and information.
