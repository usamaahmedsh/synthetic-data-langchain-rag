This is a list of countries by IPv4 address allocation.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) distributes large blocks of addresses to regional Internet registries (RIRs), which then assign them to national Internet registries and local Internet registries within their respective service regions. While IPv4 allows for a theoretical maximum of 232 addresses (approximately 4.3 billion), the number available for public use is smaller due to reserved blocks for private and special purposes.
