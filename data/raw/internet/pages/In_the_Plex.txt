== Reception ==
Siva Vaidhyanathan writes in The Washington Post: "Others have tried to make Google’s problem-solving processes intelligible and gripping. Levy has outdone them all. He has produced the most interesting book ever written about Google. He makes the biggest intellectual challenges of computer science seem endlessly fun and fascinating."  Kirkus Reviews sums up the book as: "Outstanding reportage delivered in the upbeat, informative fashion for which Levy is well known."
