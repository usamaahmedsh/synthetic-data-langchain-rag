The femosphere (also called the womanosphere) is an umbrella term for the body of online spaces that focus on discussions among women and girls that are broadly misandrist (hateful of or prejudiced against men and boys).


== History and ideology ==
The term "femosphere" was coined by Jilly Boyce Kay, a feminist media researcher.
Femosphere narratives sometimes involve a rejection of liberal feminism, asserting that it has failed to deliver a world consistent with feminists' aspirations.
