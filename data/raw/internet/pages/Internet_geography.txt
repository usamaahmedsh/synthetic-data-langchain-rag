Internet geography, also called cybergeography, is a subdiscipline of geography that studies the spatial organization of the Internet from social, economic, cultural, and technological perspectives. 
The core assumption of Internet geography is that the location of servers, websites, data, services, and infrastructure is key to understand the development and the dynamics of the Internet. For instance, the Internet's topology may be mapped by determining how fast data is transmitted between points using methods such as ping.
One topic covered by this discipline is information geography. For instance, programs that connect to the Internet, such as search engines and social media applications, enable users to sort and view the mass of information within the Internet.
Another topic that Internet geography examines is the digital divides.
