== History ==
The origins of telecommunications in Egypt traces back to 1854 when the British Eastern Telegraph Company constructed a telegraph line between Cairo and the Alexandria. Egypt's first telephone line was installed between Cairo and Alexandria in 1881, and later that year, the Egyptian government acquired the Eastern Telephone Company, establishing the Telephone and Telegraph Authority.
In 1957, Law No. 107 transferred the assets of the Eastern Telegraph Company and other telecom providers to the Ministry of Telecommunications. Presidential Decree No. 709 of the same year placed all wire and wireless communications under the jurisdiction of the Wire and Wireless Communications Authority, which reported to the Ministry of Transport.
In 1980, the Arab Republic of Egypt National Telecommunications Organization (ARENTO) was formed as an autonomous public utility under the Ministry of Transport. Under Law No. 19 of 1998, ARENTO was renamed Telecom Egypt and restructured as a joint stock company, with the Egyptian government retaining full ownership.
The liberalization of Egypt’s telecommunications sector began in 1998 and progressed gradually over the following decades. The private sector played an increasing role in mobile telephony and internet services, contributing to the sector’s expansion. In 2004, the Information Technology Industry Development Agency (ITIDA) was established under Law 15 to support Egypt’s digital transformation. ITIDA was tasked with implementing e-signature legislation and promoting an export-oriented IT sector. Over the years, it played a critical role in advancing e-business services, facilitating digital security measures, and supporting Egypt’s ICT-driven economic development.
The market underwent official deregulation in 2006 following Egypt’s commitment to the World Trade Organization Information Technology Agreement in 2003. This move aimed to open the telecommunications market, encourage competition, and attract foreign investment. In 2007, Egypt had approximately 10 million fixed phone lines, 31 million mobile phones, and 8.1 million internet users. 
Egypt's ICT sector has experienced significant growth in recent years, consistently outpacing the nation's overall economic expansion. In the fiscal year 2022/2023, the sector achieved a growth rate of 15.2%, contributing 5.1% to Egypt's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This marks an increase from a 4.4% contribution in 2019/2020. Total investments in the ICT sector reached approximately $4.2 billion in 2022/2023, reflecting a 20% increase from the previous fiscal year.


== Digital Egypt ==
In line with the Egypt Vision 2030 strategy, the country has launched the Digital Egypt initiative, aiming to transform the nation into a digitally-driven society. This comprehensive plan focuses on developing robust digital infrastructure, fostering innovation, and enhancing public services through digital means. A key component of this initiative is the Digital Egypt e-platform, which offers citizens access to a wide range of government services online, including traffic management, real estate registration, and social housing applications. The platform's goal is to streamline service delivery, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, and promote transparency within governmental operations.
Complementing the Digital Egypt initiative are various e-government programs designed to modernize public administration and improve service accessibility. The government has prioritized the digital transformation of public services, resulting in the integration of approximately 33,000 institutions into a secured government network. This network facilitates efficient data exchange between agencies, enhancing coordination and service delivery. Additionally, efforts have been made to train civil servants in digital competencies, ensuring the sustainability and effectiveness of e-government services. These initiatives collectively aim to create a more citizen-centric approach to governance, leveraging technology to meet the evolving needs of the population.
