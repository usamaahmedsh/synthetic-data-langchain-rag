The Centre for Internet and Society (CIS) is an Indian non-profit multidisciplinary research organization, based in Bengaluru. CIS works on digital pluralism, public accountability and pedagogic practices, in the field of the Internet and Society.
CIS was founded in 2008 by Sunil Abraham, based on an idea by Lawrence Liang, with initial funding by Anurag Dikshit who by 2014 remained among the centre's financial backers, alongside Rohini Nilekani. In 2020, Amber Sinha succeeded Abraham as executive director. During its first half decade, major work areas of CIS included contributing to the Indian government's efforts to standardize e-governance, as well as the country's privacy laws and telecom policy, and efforts to improve internet access in rural areas.
