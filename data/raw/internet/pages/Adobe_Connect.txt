Adobe Connect (formerly Presedia Publishing System, Macromedia Breeze, and Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro) is a software suite for remote training, web conferencing, presentation, and desktop sharing. All meeting rooms are organized into 'pods'; with each pod performing a specific role (e.g. chat, whiteboard, note etc.). Adobe Connect was formerly part of the Adobe Acrobat family and has changed names several times.


== History ==
The product was first developed by a startup called Presedia and included a first generation PowerPoint-to-Flash Plugin (which then became Adobe Presenter) and a training module. Macromedia acquired Presedia and added on a real-time web conferencing component, called Breeze Live (later renamed Breeze Meeting).
In version 5, Macromedia Breeze included four applications: Breeze Presenter test, Breeze Training, Breeze Meeting, and Breeze Events (new in version 5). Following the acquisition by Adobe, Macromedia Breeze Meeting was initially rebranded to Adobe Connect, then Adobe Acrobat Connect Professional and later as Adobe Connect. The full product line includes rebranded versions of Breeze Training, Breeze Meeting, Breeze Presenter, and Breeze Events.
