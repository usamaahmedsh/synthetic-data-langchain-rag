The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) are two proposed draft laws that were being considered by the United States Congress. Their stated goals are to increase the ability of U.S. law enforcement to fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods, and give the U.S. government and copyright holders additional tools to curb access to "rogue websites dedicated to infringing or counterfeit goods", especially those registered outside the United States.
Supporters of the laws argued that they are needed to protect the intellectual property of owners of content. Opponents of the laws argued that they endanger free speech and free expression by harmfully regulating the internet.

== Legislative narrative ==


=== Senate Judiciary Committee ===
In May 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously voted to report in favor of PIPA.

However, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) placed a "Senate hold" on the bill, postponing it from going to a full floor vote.


=== U.S. Senate ===
On January 13, six Republican co-sponsors of the bill released a letter of concern, reading in part:"We have increasingly heard from a large number of constituents and other stakeholders with vocal concerns about possible unintended consequences of the proposed legislation, including breaches in cybersecurity, damaging the integrity of the Internet, costly and burdensome litigation, and dilution of First Amendment rights."

On January 17, Senator Ron Wyden announced his intention to filibuster PIPA if necessary.
January 18 saw the Internet Blackout protests in which websites coordinated to oppose SOPA/PIPA. In the wake of online protests, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that the PIPA vote previously scheduled for January 24 would be postponed.


=== SOPA in the House of Representatives ===
Representative Lamar S. Smith introduced SOPA. Smith remarked of the bill:

"The Stop Online Piracy Act helps American innovators by protecting U.S. intellectual property from foreign criminals."
