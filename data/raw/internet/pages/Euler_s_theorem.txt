In number theory, Euler's theorem (also known as the Fermat–Euler theorem or Euler's totient theorem) states that, if n and a are coprime positive integers, then 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            φ
            (
            n
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{\varphi (n)}}
  
 is congruent to 
  
    
      
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1}
  
  modulo n, where 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
  
  denotes Euler's totient function; that is

  
    
      
        
          a
          
            φ
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        ≡
        1
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          n
          )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{\varphi (n)}\equiv 1{\pmod {n}}.}
  

In 1736, Leonhard Euler published a proof of Fermat's little theorem (stated by Fermat without proof), which is the restriction of Euler's theorem to the case where n is a prime number.  Subsequently, Euler presented other proofs of the theorem, culminating with his paper of 1763, in which he proved a generalization to the case where n is not prime.
The converse of Euler's theorem is also true: if the above congruence is true, then 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
 must be coprime.
The theorem  is further generalized by some of Carmichael's theorems.
The theorem may be used to easily reduce large powers modulo 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
. For example, consider finding the ones place decimal digit of 
  
    
      
        
          7
          
            222
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 7^{222}}
  
, i.e. 
  
    
      
        
          7
          
            222
          
        
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          10
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 7^{222}{\pmod {10}}}
  
. The integers 7 and 10 are coprime, and 
  
    
      
        φ
        (
        10
        )
        =
        4
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi (10)=4}
  
. So Euler's theorem yields 
  
    
      
        
          7
          
            4
          
        
        ≡
        1
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          10
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 7^{4}\equiv 1{\pmod {10}}}
  
, and we get 
  
    
      
        
          7
          
            222

Euler's theorem underlies the RSA cryptosystem, which is widely used in Internet communications. In this cryptosystem, Euler's theorem is used with n being a product of two large prime numbers, and the security of the system is based on the difficulty of factoring such an integer.


== Proofs ==
1. Euler's theorem can be proven using concepts from the theory of groups: 
The residue classes modulo n that are coprime to n form a group under multiplication (see the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo n for details). The order of that group is φ(n). Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the entire group, in this case φ(n). If a is any number coprime to n then a is in one of these residue classes, and its powers a, a2, ... , ak modulo n form a subgroup of the group of residue classes, with ak ≡ 1 (mod n). Lagrange's theorem says k must divide φ(n), i.e. there is an integer M such that kM = φ(n). This then implies,

  
    
      
        
          a
          
            φ
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        =
        
          a
          
            k
            M
          
        
        =
        (
        
          a
          
            k
          
        
        
          )
          
            M
          
        
        ≡
        
          1
          
            M
          
        
        =
        1
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          n
          )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{\varphi (n)}=a^{kM}=(a^{k})^{M}\equiv 1^{M}=1{\pmod {n}}.}
  

2. There is also a direct proof: Let R = {x1, x2, ... , xφ(n)} be a reduced residue system (mod n) and let a be any integer coprime to n. The proof hinges on the fundamental fact that multiplication by a permutes the xi: in other words if axj ≡ axk (mod n) then j = k. (This law of cancellation is proved in the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo n.) That is, the sets R and aR = {ax1, ax2, ... , axφ(n)}, considered as sets of congruence classes (mod n), are identical (as sets—they may be listed in different orders), so the product of all the numbers in R is congruent (mod n) to the product of all the numbers in aR:

  
    
      
        
          ∏
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            φ
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        ≡
        
          ∏
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            φ
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        a
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        =
        
          a
          
            φ
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        
          ∏
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            φ
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          n
          )
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{\varphi (n)}x_{i}\equiv \prod _{i=1}^{\varphi (n)}ax_{i}=a^{\varphi (n)}\prod _{i=1}^{\varphi (n)}x_{i}{\pmod {n}},}
  
 and using the cancellation law to cancel each xi gives Euler's theorem:

  
    
      
        
          a
          
            φ
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        ≡
        1
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          n
          )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{\varphi (n)}\equiv 1{\pmod {n}}.}
