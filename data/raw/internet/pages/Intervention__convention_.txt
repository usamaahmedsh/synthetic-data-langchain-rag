Intervention was a yearly Internet culture convention held in Rockville, Maryland. Intervention (a combination of the words "Internet" and "Convention") highlighted independent artists from all spectrums of creative output who use the Internet as their primary distribution method. The convention hosted panels, workshops, movie showings, music concerts, open gaming, and dance events. Later events added a children's track and live musical performances. Following the 2016 event, organizers placed the convention on hiatus and said a plan would be developed for its return, but this was made impossible following the abrupt failure and bankruptcy of its parent corporation, Onezumi Events.
