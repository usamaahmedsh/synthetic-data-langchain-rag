The European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) was established on 26 June 1959 by nineteen European states in Montreux, Switzerland, as a coordinating body for European state telecommunications and postal organizations. The acronym comes from the French version of its name, Conférence européenne des administrations des postes et des télécommunications.
CEPT was responsible for the creation of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 1988.


== Organization ==
CEPT is organised into three main components:

Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) – responsible for radiocommunications and telecommunications matters and formed by the merger of ECTRA (European Committee for Telecommunications Regulatory Affairs) and ERC (European Radiocommunications Committee) in September 2001
The permanent secretariat of the ECC is the European Communications Office (ECO)
European Committee for Postal Regulation (CERP, after the French "Comité européen des régulateurs postaux") – responsible for postal matters
The committee for ITU Policy (Com-ITU) is responsible for organising the co-ordination of CEPT actions for the preparation for and during the course of the ITU activities meetings of the council, Plenipotentiary Conferences, World Telecommunication Development Conferences, World Telecommunication Standardisation Assemblies
The entity is based on the concept of a Postal, telegraph and telephone service entity.
