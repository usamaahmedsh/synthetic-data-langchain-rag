A mobile network operator (MNO), also known as a mobile network provider, mobile network carrier, mobile , wireless service provider, wireless carrier, wireless operator, wireless telco, or cellular company, is a telecommunications provider of services that sells, delivers and maintains mobile telephony services to an end user.


== Overview ==
A key defining characteristic of a mobile network operator is that it must own or control access to a radio spectrum license from a regulatory or government entity, and also that it must own or control the elements of the cellular network infrastructure necessary to provide services to subscribers over the licensed radio spectrum. In addition the operator would also contain other elements like the back haul infrastructure and  provisioning computer systems.
A mobile network operator typically also has the necessary provisioning, billing, and customer care computer systems, and the marketing, customer care, and engineering organizations needed to sell, deliver, and bill for services. However, a mobile network operator can outsource any of these systems or functions and still be considered a mobile network operator.
In addition to obtaining revenue by offering retail services under its own brand, a mobile network operator may also sell access to network services at wholesale rates to mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).
