== History ==
Help Scout was created in 2011 as a pivot from Brightwurks, a web design and consultancy firm previously founded by Nick Francis, Jared McDaniel, and Denny Swindle. The company was publicly launched during their participation in Techstars Boston, a startup accelerator program.


== Features and technology ==


=== Help Desk ===
Help Scout's support software operates like a shared email inbox. The platform enables large teams to provide customer support via email using their tool. It integrates with live chat, phone systems, CRMs, and email marketing tools.


=== Docs ===
In addition to the help desk platform, Help Scout offers Docs, a self-service knowledge base as a feature in 2013. Exporting documents requires API access and programming knowledge; there is no export to ZIP file containing HTML source code/CSS/assets, or PDF offerings at this time.


=== Beacon ===
Help Scout's embeddable widget, Beacon, provides users on a website with quick access to Docs and/or serves as a contact form.


=== Mobile ===
Help Scout launched its iOS app in January 2016 and its Android app in February 2017.


== Open source contribution ==

One of the developers at Help Scout created an open-source CSS framework used to style their marketing website. Named Seed, this framework is written using Sass and follows the BEM and ITCSS naming architecture. It employs modern JavaScript-like methodologies for scoping, modularization, and dependency management. More information and Getting Started documentation can be found at seedcss.com.[1]


== Work culture ==
Help Scout operates as a fully remote company, utilizing video communication for company-wide updates. The company's sales team operates under a non-commission structure with fixed salaries.


== Branding ==
Help Scout's original logo was a literal Help Scout (akin to a Boy Scout) before changing to a medal, then a laurel wreath, and the present-day three diagonal lines which denote the initials HS (Help Scout).


== Awards, recognition, and philanthropy ==
In December 2011, Help Scout participated in a fundraising initiative for Acumen, a charity fighting poverty, donating over $100,000 from the sale of a poster featuring Steve Jobs' quote “Here’s to the crazy ones.”
In November 2015, Help Scout was named by AppStorm as one of six customer service software offerings to delight customers on Mac. That year, it was also recognized as a “marketing tool to know” by Business2Community and a “game-changing software solution” for startups by Business.com. In 2016, BostInno’s listed Help Scout among the “16 Boston Startups To Watch in 2016”.
Help Scout's work culture and job descriptions have also been acknowledged, winning the “Best Job Description” award from The Workies Awards by Workable in 2015.
