In the United States, the term gain visibility through the establishment of AT&T Long Lines division of the Bell System in 1947 when a radio relay between New York and Boston that was made up of seven radio relay stations was inaugurated. The division was subsequently spun out as AT&T Long Distance with the breakup of AT&T in 1984. 
Though supplanted by fiber-optic networks for long-distance communications, private microwave networks between key stock markets within United States and within Europe gained popularity among high-frequency traders after 2010 as it has significantly lower levels of latency compared with fiber networks.
