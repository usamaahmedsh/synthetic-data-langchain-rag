The unexpected red theory is a design theory asserting that incorporating red-colored home accessories can enhance interior design. Coined by Taylor Migliazzo Simon, a designer based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the theory first attained popularity on the social media platform TikTok in January 2024, and eventually received widespread coverage across various design magazines.


== Critical analysis and reception ==
Design journalists and publications have created listicles to highlight interior spaces, such as houses and hotels, that reflect the theory. 
In Real Simple, journalist Morgan Noll wrote that "red is one of the most visible colors in the color spectrum so it has a strong ability to grab attention and attract the eye." 
In The Daily Telegraph, Sophie Robinson, a designer, criticized that “you can’t just add red to any room – it’s just not that simple. It can look jarring.”
