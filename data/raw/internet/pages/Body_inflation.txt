Body inflation or inflation fetish is the practice of inflating or pretending to inflate a part of one's body, often for sexual gratification. It is commonly done by inserting items such as balloons, bouncy balls, or beach balls underneath clothes or a skin-tight suit and then inflating them. Some people have specially made inflatable suits, to make themselves bigger all over. Sometimes the body is actually inflated also, such as by enema or drinking large amounts of liquid. The entire concept of body inflation is heavily associated with the feeling of being bound to one spot, or usually due to a combination of a stomach fetish with many other fetish elements.


== Examples ==
Some inflation fantasies are inspired by non-sexual gags from popular culture. One such example is from the Roald Dahl novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and its film adaptations, wherein Violet Beauregarde is transfigured into an immobile blueberry-like entity after eating an experimental chewing gum. This scene inspired "blueberry porn", involving skin turning blue and bodies swelling with blueberry juice, with bodily fluids also turning blue and leaking out of erogenous zones.
Another example is Mr. Blowup, who appears in the Deviant Desires book. He wears air-inflated double-skinned latex suits, and has made a number of TV appearances in the UK, including Eurotrash.
Other inflatable fetishists generate erotic stories, artwork, video, and audio files to indulge their fantasies. Sexual roleplay is also fairly common, either in person or via online conversation. The notion of the fantasy scenarios ending in popping or explosion is often a divisive topic in the community.
The first inflatable fetish community organized online in 1994, in the form of an e-mail list; as the popularity of online communication grew, so did the online community.
