The EPPY Awards honor excellence in digital publishing, and are presented by Editor & Publisher magazine. Designed in 1996 to honor newspaper companies that did an "outstanding job in creating online services," the awards were originally given in partnership between Mediaweek and Editor & Publisher and named the Best Online Newspaper Services Competition, and presented at the end of the Interactive Newspaper Conference.  
In 1998 the awards were renamed the EPPY Awards. and in 2003 the awards were expanded to recognize websites associated with other media outlets, as well as newspapers. Today the EPPY Awards honor the best in digital news publishing across more than 45 diverse categories, including excellence in college/university digital journalism. 
From 2003 to 2009 Mediaweek co-sponsored the (renamed) Interactive Media Conference & Trade Show, and both the awards and conference were moved from February to May. Beginning in 2011, the EPPY Awards moved online and is now totally run and owned by Editor & Publisher Magazine.
