Communications in Papua New Guinea refers to the media in the country which are regulated by the Media Council of Papua New Guinea such as newspapers, radio, television, and the Internet.


== Newspapers ==

Papua New Guinea has two circulating newspapers: 

The National, and the
Papua New Guinea Post-Courier.


== Radio ==
Radio broadcasting in Papua New Guinea was launched on 25 October 1935 by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). It was replaced by the National Broadcasting Commission which was formed under the Broadcasting Commission Act of 1973 (authority of Parliament). The commission was renamed as the National Broadcasting Corporation in 1994:

The state-run National Broadcasting Corporation operates three radio networks with multiple repeaters and about 20 provincial stations (2009).
Several commercial radio stations with multiple transmission points as well as several community stations (2009).
Transmissions of several international broadcasters are accessible (2009).
Radios: 410,000 (1997).


== Television ==
Three free-to-air television networks, limited to larger population centres or areas where mine sites, or local community groups have decided to redistribute the signal:
EM TV - commercial, owned by Fiji Television, started in 1987 but bought off by Telikom PNG in 2014
NBC TV - state owned, started in 2008
TV Wan - digital free-to-view channel, started in 2014
Satellite and cable TV services are available through Digicel Play PNG and Click TV PNG, who owns both satellite and terrestrial services in PNG. MMDS subscription television is available through Hitron Digital.


== Telephone ==

Papua New Guinea's international country code is 675.

Submarine cable: the APNG-2 submarine communications cable links Papua New Guinea directly to Australia and indirectly to New Zealand and the rest of the world. A collaboration between Telikom PNG, Telstra (Australia), and Telecom New Zealand, it has been in service since late 2006. It replaced the APNG-1 cable, a coaxial copper cable of 16 Mbit/s, which was retired in 2006.

=== Censorship ===
There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without judicial oversight. Individuals and groups engage in the expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail.
The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. Newspapers offer a variety of editorial viewpoints and report on controversial topics. There is no evidence of officially sanctioned government censorship, although newspaper editors complained of intimidation tactics aimed at influencing coverage. There were some examples of police officers targeting journalists who negatively covered police activities. Although the constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, there are instances of abuse.
