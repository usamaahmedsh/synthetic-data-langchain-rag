Information architecture is the structural design of shared information environments, in particular the organisation of websites and software to support usability and findability.
The term information architecture was coined by Richard Saul Wurman. Since its inception, information architecture has become an emerging community of practice focused on applying principles of design, architecture and information science in digital spaces.  
Typically, a model or concept of information is used and applied to activities which require explicit details of complex information systems. These activities include library systems and database development.


== Definition ==
The term information architecture has different meanings in different branches of information systems or information technology.


=== User experience ===
In user experience design, information architecture has been described as the  structural design of shared information environments, comprising the study and practice of organising and labelling web sites, intranets, online communities, and software to support user experience, in particular, the findability and usability of information. It has also been described as an emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape.


=== Information systems ===
Technically speaking, information architecture comprises the combination of organization, labeling, search and navigation systems within websites and intranets, serving as a navigational aid to the content of information-rich systems.


=== Data architecture ===
Information architecture can be described as a subset of data architecture where usable data is constructed, designed, and arranged in a fashion most useful to the users of data.


=== Systems design ===
In the field of systems design, for example, information architecture is a component of enterprise architecture that deals with the information component when describing the structure of an enterprise. Some system design practitioners regard information architecture as strictly the application of information science to web design, which considers such issues as classification and information retrieval, and not factors like user experience and information design.


== Principles ==
Principles of information architecture include the following:

The principle of objects
The principle of choices
The principle of disclosure
The principle of exemplars
The principle of front doors
The principle of multiple classification
The principle of focused navigation
The principle of growth


== History ==
Richard Saul Wurman is credited with coining the term information architecture in relation to the design of information.
From 1998 to 2015, Peter Morville and Louis Rosenfeld were co-authors of Information Architecture for the World Wide Web.
Other authors include Jesse James Garrett and Christina Wodtke.
