This is a list of cybersecurity information technologies. Cybersecurity concerns all technologies that store, manipulate, or move computer data, such as computers, data networks, and all devices connected to or included in said networks, such as routers and switches. All information technology devices and facilities need to be secured against intrusion, unauthorized use, and vandalism. Users of information technology are to be protected from theft of assets, extortion, identity theft, loss of privacy, damage to equipment, business process compromise, and general disruption. The public should be protected against acts of cyberterrorism, such as compromise or denial of service.
Cybersecurity is a major endeavor in the IT industry. There are a number of professional certifications given for cybersecurity training and expertise. Billions of dollars are spent annually on cybersecurity, but no computer or network is immune from attacks or can be considered completely secure.
This article attempts to list important Wikipedia articles about cybersecurity.


== General ==
Introductory articles about cybersecurity subjects:


== Cryptography ==
The art of secret writing or code. A "plaintext" message is converted by the sender to "ciphertext" by means of a mathematical algorithm that uses a secret key. The receiver of the message then reverses the process and converts the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.


=== Cryptography subject matter ===


=== Cipher technologies ===


== Steganography ==
Steganography is the process of hiding data within other data, most commonly by hiding data inside images.


== Authentication and access ==
The process by which a potential client is granted authorized use of an IT facility by proving its identity.


== Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ==
A framework for managing digital certificates and encryption keys.


== Tools ==
Computerized utilities designed to study and analyze the security of IT facilities and/or break into them on an unauthorized and potentially criminal basis.


== Threats ==
Modes of potential attacks on IT facilities.


== Exploits ==
Security exploits affecting computers.


== Criminal activity ==
Violation of the law by means of breaking into and/or misusing IT facilities. Laws that attempt to prevent these crimes.


== Nation states ==
Countries and their governments that use, misuse, and/or violate IT facilities to achieve national goals.


== End-point protection ==
The securing of networked computers, mobile devices and terminals.


== Network protection ==
The protection of the means by which data is moved from one IT facility to another.


== Processing protection ==
The securing of IT facilities that manipulate data, such as computer servers, often by means of specialized cybersecurity hardware.


== Storage protection ==
The protection of data in its non-moving state, usually on magnetic or optical media or in computer memory.


== Management of security ==
The processes by which security technology is monitored for faults, deployed and configured, measured for its usage, queried for performance metrics and log files, and/or monitored for intrusions.


== Standards, frameworks, & requirements ==
Officially agreed architectures and conceptual structures for designing, building, and conducting cybersecurity.
