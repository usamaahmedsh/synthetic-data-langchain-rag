== Plot ==
Yuta Gamon, a high school student and self-proclaimed NEET, runs the occult summary blog "Kirikiri Basara," hoping to get rich quick through affiliate links by debunking the supernatural. His life changes drastically when he seeks an interview with Professor Isayuki Hashigami, a controversial physicist researching the existence of the spirit world. Instead, Yuta discovers Hashigami’s brutally murdered and scalped body. At the scene, he retrieves a strange key hidden in the Professor's gold tooth and is guided away by a mysterious voice nicknamed "Zonko," channeled through his late father’s antique "Skysensor" radio.
The murder catalyzes the convergence of nine disparate individuals in Kichijoji. The group includes Yuta’s energetic friend, Ryoka Narusawa; Sarai Hashigami, the professor's staunchly skeptical son; Miyuu Aikawa, a popular high school fortune teller who predicted the murder days earlier; Toko Sumikaze, an editor for the occult magazine Mumuu; Ririka Nishizono, an introverted doujin author whose work eerily predicted the events; Aria Kurenaino, a black magic medium (unknowingly accompanied by Kiryu Kusakabe, whom she mistakes for a "devil"); and Shun Moritsuka, a detective secretly investigating the deeper conspiracy.
The investigation quickly spirals following the "256 Incident"—the inexplicable mass drowning of 256 people in Inokashira Park. Yuta and Sarai discover and decode a list hidden by Professor Hashigami, which chillingly matches the victims of the incident. They uncover a vast conspiracy led by the Society of the Eight Gods of Fortune (also operating as the Musashino Medical Group, or MMG). This organization is conducting clandestine experiments, blending advanced science and the occult. Using technology derived from Nikola Tesla's research, they manipulate electromagnetic frequencies and utilize injections of Scandium to control human perception and action. Their ultimate goal is the "World System," a network intended to synchronize the physical and astral realms, granting them a form of immortality. They orchestrated the 256 Incident to harvest astral bodies for their experiments, utilizing a massive local antenna array known as "Odd Eye" to broadcast their control signals.
The most chilling discovery comes when Yuta, Sarai, Toko, and the others realize their own names are on the victim list. They struggle with denial; Yuta initially believes he is alive because he can interact with the physical world and other people, only to realize those he can speak to—like Saeko Kitaya, whose pass case he returned—are also victims of the 256 Incident, and that the living cannot perceive them. They are forced to accept the truth: they are all dead, existing as astral bodies (ghosts). They are essentially electromagnetic entities containing their memories, as theorized by Hashigami. They also discover a crucial time dilation: roughly one day in the astral plane equals only one minute in the physical world, meaning very little time has passed since their deaths. Furthermore, Yuta learns that Ryoka is actually Aveline Tesla, a spirit guide linked to the Society's experiments, who has been communicating as "Zonko."
With the Society's plan nearing completion, the group confronts the organization at the Odd Eye facility. They use their knowledge and Tesla-inspired devices—including the Skysensor and Yuta’s toy Poya-Gun, now unlocked as the potent Wardenclyffe Gun—to disrupt the signal. In the final showdown, Yuta sacrifices his astral existence to overload and destroy Odd Eye. This blast of energy severs the link between the realms and propels the souls of the victims back in time. Due to the time dilation, only nine minutes have passed in the physical world since the mass drowning. The group awakens back in Inokashira Lake, allowing them to survive before permanent death occurs. The conspiracy is thwarted, but the victory is bittersweet: Yuta, having expended his energy, remains an astral being. He finds peace in the spirit realm, reuniting with his father and watching over the friends whose second chance he secured.
