The telephone system in Andorra, including mobile, data and Internet is operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, Andorra Telecom, formerly known as Servei de Telecomunicacions d'Andorra (STA). The same company is also responsible for managing the technical infrastructure and national broadcasting networks for radio and television, both analogue and digital.
At one time, Andorra shared the country code of France (+33), and also had a special routing code for calls from Spain, but now has its own country calling code, 376.

Internet access is available only through the national telephone company, Andorra Telecom (formerly STA). Access was first provided in the 1990s by dial-up, but this has since been mostly replaced throughout the country by ADSL at a fixed speed of 2 Mbit/s, and in metropolitan areas of the country by fibre to the home at a fixed speed of 100 Mbit/s. The average cost of a high-speed internet connection is €35.35. The whole country was to have Fibre-Optic to the Home at a minimum speed of 100 Mbit/s by 2010, and the availability was complete in June 2012 although actual available bandwidth to the end user never exceeds 10 Mbit/s.
