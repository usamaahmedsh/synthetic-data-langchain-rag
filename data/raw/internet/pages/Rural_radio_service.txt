Rural radiotelephone service (RRTS) provides basic, analog communications service between locations deemed so remote that traditional wireline service or service by other means is not feasible.  RRTS uses channelized radio to provide radiotelephone services such as Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Service between a fixed subscriber location and a remote central office, private line service between a two fixed locations or interconnection between two or more central offices. RRTS does not enable mobile communications.
