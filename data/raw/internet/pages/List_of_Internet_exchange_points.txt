This is a list of Internet exchange points (IXPs).  There are several sources for IXP locations, including Packet Clearing House, who have maintained the earliest list of IXPs, with global coverage since 1994. Also, Telegeography, PeeringDB and the Network Startup Resource Center.  Additionally, there are Internet exchange point associations that publish lists of member IXPs.  Some of the Internet exchange point associations are loosely grouped into the Internet Exchange Point Federation.
For more information on the largest IXPs, see list of Internet exchange points by size.
