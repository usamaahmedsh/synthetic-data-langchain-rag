The following is a list of the highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada, a market known as the North American box office or, in the United States film industry, the domestic box office.


== Not adjusted for inflation ==
This is a list of the highest-grossing films in the U.S. and Canada in US dollars, ranked by lifetime gross. This ranking does not adjust for inflation. 
The list also includes the initial gross without adjustments.
The list also includes the lifetime gross with adjustment for inflation based on the U.S. Consumer Price Index.


== Adjusted for ticket-price inflation ==
This is a list of films ranked by ticket sales with adjustments for changes in ticket prices and/or inflation
For movies released 2019 and earlier: Box Office Mojo tracks average ticket prices at theaters from 1910 to 2020. The list here starts with their "Adj. Lifetime Gross" based on 2020 ticket prices, and then applies Template:Inflation to further adjust to the equivalent in 2024.
For movies released 2020 and later: This list starts with the film's lifetime gross, and then applies Template:Inflation as if the entire lifetime gross was earned in the year of release, to further adjust to the equivalent in 2024.
Many of the films on this list were released prior to the availability of home video and have had multiple releases.


=== Factors in determining "adjusted gross" ===
No one yet has calculated a truly precise and definite referential adjusted gross for a film, since doing so would have to take into account most (or all) of the following:

Box office gross on initial release
Ticket price at time of release, or its relative price to other commodities in a given year, in relation to general inflation and gross domestic product.
Economic conditions that may help or hurt the entertainment industry as a whole (theaters in 2008 lowered ticket prices to attract more viewers though the average ticket cost $7.00)
Population at time of release—to be used to calculate:
Availability of films (number of theaters and screens, number of prints)
Competition of other media (television, internet, home video, film piracy)
Total number of films in the marketplace at a given time
Screen quotas (no influence on U.S. box office)
Price differences: matinee and evening tickets, roadshow tickets, or difference between rural and urban cinemas
Length of release (number of weeks)
Further explanation of issues with calculating an adjusted gross can be found in the article for List of highest-grossing films.
