LiveVideo was a social network launched in 2006 backed by MySpace founder Brad Greenspan. It offered one of the first user generated video hosting platforms integrated with social media features, described as a mashup of MySpace and YouTube, and later an interactive live video streaming platform. 


== History ==
LiveVideo was founded in 2006 but launched officially in 2008, with an interactive interview with Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns, called Drive Home with Steve Nash.
LiveVideo.com struggled to take advantage of its early leadership in the live video sector as a result of a lack of financial resources an issue accelerating in 2008 after CEO Brad Greenspan acquired Revver.com, a video hosting website located in Los Angeles.
In 2013, the original LiveVideo.com website was closed.


== Reception ==
LiveVideo received media coverage with its official launch in 2008 and after partnering with William Shatner to star in video series ShatnerVision. Later LiveVideo created a controversy by successfully recruiting Smosh  “YouTube’s biggest stars” in 2007 to create videos.
