=== History ===
The VX series of Microsoft LifeCam debuted on 13 June 2006, and were available for sale in August 2006, as Microsoft's first entry into selling webcams, with only two models, the VX-3000 and VX-6000. One of the exclusive features include the integration with Windows Live Messenger, by having a Windows Live Call button that can be used to easily initiate a video call.
These models both feature a similar round body design, with a round base, known as the Universal Attachment Base.

The entire series was designed for desktop use, as it used a base for attaching it to a desktop monitor. All webcams of this series interface via USB.
