The Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol is used by the Reliable server pooling (RSerPool) framework for the communication between Pool Registrars to maintain and synchronize a handlespace.
It is allocated on the application layer like the Aggregate Server Access Protocol.  It is a work in progress within the IETF.
