The IT-Political Association (Danish: IT-Politisk Forening, commonly known as IT-Pol) is a Danish non-profit NGO, which works to collect information on IT and convey this to politicians and the society to get the best possible grounds for legislation. The association is independent of political parties and communicates with politicians from all political parties. Membership is open to anyone.
IT-Pol is the Danish equivalent of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
The Free Software privacy CD, Polippix, was started by the IT-Political Association.
