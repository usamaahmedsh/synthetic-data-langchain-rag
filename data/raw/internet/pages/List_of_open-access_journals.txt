This is a list of open-access journals by field. The list contains notable journals which have a policy of full open access. It does not include delayed open access journals, hybrid open access journals, or related collections or indexing services.
True open-access journals can be split into two categories: 

diamond or platinum open-access journals, which charge no additional publication, open access or article processing fees
gold open-access journals, which charge publication fees (also called article processing charges, APCs).
