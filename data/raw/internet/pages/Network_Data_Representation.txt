Network Data Representation (NDR) is an implementation of the presentation layer in the OSI model. It is used for DCE/RPC and Microsoft RPC (MSRPC).
Network Data Representation (NDR) is a data encoding and decoding method used in  distributed systems, specifically in  Remote Procedure Call (RPC) systems. NDR is part of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) RPC, allowing different computers and systems to communicate by exchanging data in a standardized format. NDR facilitates data transfer between systems with different architectures, ensuring that data is correctly represented and understood on both ends.
