Nokia Lumia 510 is a budget Windows Phone 7 smartphone developed by Nokia designed specifically for developing markets, such as China, India, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, running the Windows Phone 7.5 (later Windows Phone 7.8) operating system. Unveiled on 23 September 2012, it was released in November of the same year.
The phone shares the limitations of the Nokia Lumia 610, like not being able to run all Windows Phone applications and not being able to run all background tasks.
Phone Arena has criticized the lack of microSD slot for storage expansion given so little internal storage, the lack of camera flash, the lack of a front-facing camera, the low-resolution video capture and too little RAM memory (256 MB RAM) that makes the phone slow and prevents running some applications.
On 25 February 2013, the Nokia Lumia 520, the successor of the Nokia Lumia 510, was presented. The improvements are Windows Phone 8, dual-core 1 GHz Qualcomm S4 chipset, 512 MB of RAM, a better IPS panel display and support for up to 64 GB microSD cards.
