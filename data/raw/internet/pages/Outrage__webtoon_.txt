Set in a future only five minutes away, Outrage tells the story of a mysterious individual who can navigate the Internet and physically manifest at the source of the "vile bile" that spews throughout social media as a digital superhero/anti-hero. Armed with an array of weaponry limited by imagination, the A.I. Outrage exacts swift justice on anyone who "outrages" anyone on the Internet, manifesting from their computers or smartphones and comedically beating them to a pulp.
