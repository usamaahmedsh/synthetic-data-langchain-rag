w3m is a free and open source text-based web browser licensed under the MIT license. It differs from other very early text-based browsers by supporting elements such as tables, frames, and images.


== History ==
The name "w3m" stands for "WWW wo miru (WWWを見る)", which is Japanese for "to see the WWW", and where "W3" is a numeronym of "WWW". The original project is no longer active. A different developer, Tatsuya Kinoshita, was maintaining a fork until early 2024. Kinoshita left the project after a few months. A new fork was created as a result.


== Functions ==
w3m runs in terminal emulator programs such as xterm and GNOME Terminal. The browser has tabbed browsing, right click menus, and image support, along with support for tables and frames. It also functions as a terminal pager. It can be navigated solely using the keyboard or with the mouse. There are two different display modes, one with colors and one that is monochrome.
w3m can be used within Emacs.
Some distributions require the installation of a second package, w3m-img, to render images using w3m.
