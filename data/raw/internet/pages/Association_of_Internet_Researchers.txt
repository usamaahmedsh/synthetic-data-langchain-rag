The Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) is a learned society dedicated to the advancement of the transdisciplinary field of Internet studies. Founded in 1999, it is an international, member-based support network promoting critical and scholarly Internet research, independent from traditional disciplines and existing across academic borders.
AoIR was formally founded on May 30, 1999, at a meeting of nearly sixty scholars at the San Francisco Hilton and Towers, following initial discussions at a 1998 conference at Drake University entitled "The World Wide Web and Contemporary Cultural Theory: Metaphor, Magic & Power". The inaugural conference was organised by Nancy Baym, Jeremy Hunsinger and Steve Jones at the University of Kansas in 2000, and attracted 300 scholars. As the Chronicle of Higher Education noted, its rapid growth during the first few years of its existence marked the coming of age of Internet studies. It has continued to grow, with a membership of approximately 400 scholars. It supports AIR-L, a mailing list with over 5,000 subscribers.
AoIR holds an annual academic conference, as well as promoting online discussion and collaboration through a long-running mailing list. It also hosts a Mastodon instance, AoIR.social.


== Activities ==
The Association supports scholarly communication in a number of ways:

It organizes an annual, peer-reviewed scholarly conference, which accepts paper and presentation submissions from all disciplines.
As part of its annual conference, it hosts an annual one day interdisciplinary Doctoral Colloquium for Ph.D. students and an Early Career Researchers event for professionals who are in their first academic positions following the completion of the Ph.D.
It hosts the AIR-L mailing list with over 5000 subscribers.
It has published multiple editions of the Internet Research Annual with Peter Lang.
It hosts working groups that produce reports of interest to researchers in the field, most notably the AoIR Guide on Ethical Online Research.
It co-sponsors an annual issue of the journal Information, Communication and Society consisting of top papers from the annual conference.
It publishes Selected Papers of Internet Research (SPIR), an open-access online collection of papers presented at the annual conference.
It curates videos of its keynote and some of its other speakers on its YouTube page.
