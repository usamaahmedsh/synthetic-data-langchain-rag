Guadalinex was an Ubuntu-based operating system promoted by the government of Andalusia (Spain). It is used in schools, public libraries, centers for elderly people and Guadalinfo centers.
There were five different versions of Guadalinex:

Guadalinex EDU (specially developed for schools by the CGA), includes Gnome Nanny
Guadalinex CDM (for centers of elderly people)
Guadalinex Guadalinfo (only used in Guadalinfo centers, where any person living in Andalusian rural areas can access the Internet for free)
Guadalinex Bibliotecas (special version for public libraries)
Guadalinex Mini (minimalistic Guadalinex distribution, suitable for old computers, and netbooks)
In 2018, the Regional Government of Andalusia discontinues Guadalinex and the planned 10th version of Guadalinex never released.
In the educational space, in around 2021, Guadalinex Edu (the education version of Guadalinex) was succeeded by EducaAndOS.
