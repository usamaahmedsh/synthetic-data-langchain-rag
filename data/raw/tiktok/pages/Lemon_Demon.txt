== History ==
Neil Cicierega began releasing instrumental music and several remixes of video game music under the moniker Trapezoid in the late 90s and early 2000s, creating 3 albums whilst frequently active on Adventure Game Studio. The artist name was retroactively anagrammed to "Deporitaz" as an existing band called Trapezoid demanded that he change it, despite Neil having moved on from releasing music under Trapezoid. On January 21, 2003, Cicierega released Lemon Demon's first song, "Don't Be Like the Sun", later saying "eventually I started experimenting with singing, and once I felt ready to do that full time, I christened myself Lemon Demon and went into it head on". He then released his first four albums: Clown Circus (2003), Live from the Haunted Candle Shop (2003), Hip to the Javabean (2004), and Damn Skippy (2005).
In late 2005, Cicierega and animator Shawn Vulliez released a Flash animated music video for Lemon Demon's "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny". The video amassed over 6.5 million views in 6 months on Newgrounds and topped the "Funny Five" on The Dr. Demento Show for several weeks, becoming the No. 1 Request for 2006. The song was later included in Lemon Demon's fifth album Dinosaurchestra (2006). An updated recording of it was released to the Rock Band Network in 2010. Lemon Demon's sixth studio album, View-Monster (2008), features "Modify" as a bonus track, which later became a popular song on TikTok. A remix of the Beatles' "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" is additionally included as a bonus track on the album. Another notable track from View-Monster is Bill Watterson, about a fan obsessing over comic artist Bill Watterson.
Cicierega released Spirit Phone as Lemon Demon's seventh studio album on February 29, 2016. The album was the No. 1 best-selling album on Bandcamp for the first week of its release. On July 10, 2018, it was announced that copies of the album on CD, cassette, and vinyl would be sold through Needlejuice Records, who would later physically distribute remastered versions of all of Lemon Demon's studio work dating back to 2005. "Touch-Tone Telephone" later became Lemon Demon's most-streamed song, surpassing "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny" in September 2020. This was then surpassed by "Fine" in July 2024, which had garnered over 75 million streams on Spotify at the time. As of September 2025, "Fine" is still Lemon Demon's most streamed song with 116 million streams.
Cicierega uploaded the song "Funkytown" to his Patreon page in 2017, later contributing it to the 2020 charity compilation album Needlejustice, which benefits the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. It would later be released as an official single alongside "One Weird Tip" on January 21, 2023.
