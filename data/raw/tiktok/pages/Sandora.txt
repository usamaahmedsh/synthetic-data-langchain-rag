== History ==
In 1995, Lithuanian businessmen Ihor Bezzub and Raymondas Tumenas provided start-up capital for the implementation of a business plan to Serhiy Sypko, a lecturer at Mykolaiv University of Shipbuilding. Production started the following year. In 2000, a puree and semifinished product production was launched.
In 2007, one of the most important deals on the FMCG market in Ukraine was concluded, worth USD 678 million. PepsiCo acquired the largest juice producer, Sandora. This provided opportunities to develop production in Ukraine and establish the processing of seasonal vegetables and fruits through further investments. For example, in 2009-2010, the company started producing Pepsi, 7UP and Lipton Ice Tea. In 2014, the company launched a snack line for the production of Xpycteam crisps and started producing Mirinda. In 2019, the company's production facilities started producing Lay's crisps.
