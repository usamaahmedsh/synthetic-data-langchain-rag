== History ==
Fox Entertainment emerged in 2019 subsequent to the acquisition of Fox's former television studio, 20th Century Fox Television, along with other assets acquired by Disney. On August 6, 2019, Fox Entertainment expanded its portfolio by acquiring the animation studio Bento Box Entertainment. Subsequent developments included a collaboration with Caffeine in April 2020 to produce the AniDom Beyond Show, hosted by Andy Richter. Initially intending to foster scripted and unscripted projects through a division called Sidecar, aimed at developing content for both Fox's broadcast network and external platforms, Fox later dissolved Sidecar in June 2020, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry.
In August 2021, Fox Entertainment entered into an overall deal with Gordon Ramsay to establish Studio Ramsay Global, which absorbed Ramsay's pre-existing business with All3Media and would oversee his future endeavors. September 2021 saw Fox Entertainment's acquisition of TMZ from WarnerMedia for approximately $50 million. Subsequent developments included signing Wonwoo Park, creator of the South Korean format King of Mask Singer, which had been adapted by Fox as The Masked Singer, to a first-look deal in November 2021, and the acquisition of television film studio MarVista Entertainment in December 2021, with an emphasis on content production for its streaming service Tubi. Exploring content for internal Fox streaming service Fox Nation, the entertainment division created new episodes of Cops and a follow-up to A&E series Duck Dynasty called Duck Family Treasure.
Further expansion occurred in February 2022 with the acquisition of the Gumby franchise. In September 2022, Fox Corporation launched Fox Entertainment Studios, its inaugural foray into wholly in-house television production, premiering its first show, Monarch, on September 11, 2022. Additionally, Fox Entertainment re-entered the international distribution arena by establishing Fox Entertainment Global.
In January 2023, Fox Entertainment and Hulu announced a new multi-year deal encompassing in-season streaming rights for Fox's primetime shows. By July 2023, Fox Entertainment declared its commitment to television production in Ireland, establishing the largest unscripted production hub and confirming its role as the global hub for the American hit cooking competition series Next Level Chef with Gordon Ramsay. Amid the 2023 Actors' and Writers' strikes, the entertainment division underwent a realignment to strengthen alignment with its parent entity, Fox Corporation.
On March 27, 2024, Fox Entertainment's operations were restructured into three groups: Fox Television Network, Fox Entertainment Studios and Fox Entertainment Global, with Fernando Szew named as head of the second unit. Around 30 employees were subsequently laid off in July 2024.
In October 2025, Fox Entertainment invested in vertical video company Holywater. As part of the deal, Fox Entertainment Studios will create and produce more than 200 vertical video titles for My Drama over the next two years. In the same month, Fox Entertainment acquired an equity stake in B.J. Novak's restaurant pop-up brand Chain, also entering a first-look deal to develop television and media projects based on the concept.
In November 2025, Fox Entertainment acquired rom-com podcast company Meet Cute.
