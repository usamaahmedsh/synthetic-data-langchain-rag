In the United States, the 4 AM club is a conspiracy theory that began in the immediate aftermath of the 2024 United States presidential election. Referred to by media outlets as a left-wing version of QAnon, the theory proposes that Kamala Harris, the 49th Vice President of the United States, won the 2024 election and is currently serving as the 47th President of the United States in a parallel universe.
Proponents of the conspiracy theory believe that at 4:00 AM on November 6, 2024, the universe split into two alternate realities. They believe that Kamala Harris won the 2024 United States presidential election in the "correct" universe, and that humanity needs to realize it's "mistake" to "jump back" to the correct reality. The conspiracy theory is spread on social media such as TikTok and YouTube, with many proponents being self-described spiritual healers, witches, and psychics that claim to be aware of the split in reality.
