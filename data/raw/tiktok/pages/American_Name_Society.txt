The American Name Society (ANS) is a non-profit organization founded in 1951 to promote onomastics, the study of names and naming practices, both in the United States and abroad. The organization investigates cultural insights, settlement history, and linguistic characteristics revealed in names.
The ANS runs an annual conference for name scholars and enthusiasts, and it is the largest scholarly society dedicated to "the investigation of names and how they develop". Since 1952, the ANS has produced the journal Names. Since its very first issue in 1952, this scientific quarterly has continually published original articles, notes, and book reviews that investigate the derivation, function, and impact of names and naming in North America and around the world. The American Dialect Society was the parent organization of ANS. It has also been associated with the Modern Language Association.


== History ==
In the early 1950s, members of the American Dialect Society felt that there ought to be another organization focused on the function of proper nouns. On December 29, 1951, in Detroit, a group of academics voted to create the American Name Society, which would focus on onomastics and publish a quarterly journal with content written by society members. The founders appointed a Sponsoring Committee with 29 members and elected a president, Elsdon C. Smith. The first meeting was held on December 27, 1952, in Boston. The ANS has had a broad scope since its inception, and attracts specialists from a variety of fields.


== Names: A Journal of Onomastics ==
In March 1953, the ANS began publishing Names, "a journal of onomastics." The first volume of Names was published in March 1953, edited by Erwin Gudde. George R. Stewart, a founding member of the ANS, described his vision for using Names to define the field of onomastics. As of January 2021, all current and archived issues of Names became available for free via the Open Access program at the University of Pittsburgh. In 2022, Names was awarded the exclusive DOAJ Seal from the Directory of Open Access Journals, reflecting best practices in open access publishing. Professor I.M. Nick is the current Editor-in-Chief of Names.
