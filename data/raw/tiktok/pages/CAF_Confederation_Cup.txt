The competition has been won by 14 clubs, six of which have won it more than once. RS Berkane and CS Sfaxien are the most successful clubs in the competition's history, having won the tournament three times each. RS Berkane are the current defending champions, having beaten Simba S.C. in the 2025 final.

The following year, Moroccan club AS FAR won the cup against Nigeria's Dolphin FC. In 2006, Tunisian club Étoile du Sahel won the cup against Moroccan AS FAR (thanks to the away goals rule).

=== Format ===
The competition is played into two phases; the qualification phase and the main phase.


=== Qualification phase ===
The competition begins with a preliminary round and then a first qualifying round played in a "trim-down" knock-out format with the away goals rule serving as tiebreakers.


=== Main phase ===
The sixteen winning teams from the second qualifying round enter the group stage divided into four groups of four. Each team will play against the other three opponents in a round-robin system three points for a win.
The group winners and runners-up qualify to a two-legged knock-out rounds which shall be played in two matches, home and away in three rounds (quarter-finals, semi-finals and the finals).
In case of equality in the number of goals scored during the two matches, the team scoring the greatest number of away goals will be declared winner. If the number of goals scored on the away matches is equal, kicks from the penalty mark will be taken.


=== The Super Cup ===
The winners will face the CAF Champions League winners in the CAF Super Cup the following season on the former's home venue.


== Sponsorship ==
In October 2004, MTN contracted a four-year deal to sponsor CAF's competitions worth US$12.5 million, which at that time was the biggest sponsorship deal in African sporting history.
In 2008, CAF put a value of €100 million for a comprehensive and long-term package of its competitions when it opened tenders for a new sponsor, which was scooped up by French telecommunications giant Orange through the signing of an eight-year deal in July the following year, whose terms were not disclosed.
On 21 July 2016, French energy and petroleum giant Total S.A. (renamed TotalEnergies in 2021) secured an eight-year sponsorship package from CAF to sponsor its competitions, beginning with its flagship competition, the Africa Cup of Nations.
