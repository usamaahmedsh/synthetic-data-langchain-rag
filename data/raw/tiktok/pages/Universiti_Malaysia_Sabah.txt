Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS; English: University of Malaysia Sabah) is a comprehensive public university in Malaysia. It was officially established on 24 November 1994 as the ninth public university in the country. The university is located on a 999-acre site at Sepanggar Bay in Kota Kinabalu in the Malaysian state of Sabah. Set against the breathtaking backdrop of Mount Kinabalu and the South China Sea, UMS is widely regarded as one of Southeast Asia's most beautiful campuses. Since 2022, UMS has been attracting many tourists, with Chinese and Korean visitors being among the most frequent, EcoCampus Visitor Information Centre (EVIC) played a key role by providing maps, trip advice, and bike rental services to enhance tourism experience on the campus. 4 April 2025, a man's corpse was found hanging from a tree branch on the hillside leading to Kampung Kibagu, nearby UMS Kota Kinabalu campus. One day later, UMS authorities have confirmed the incident on Facebook, highlighting no UMS students and staffs are involved, investigation ongoing afterwards.
Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) has faced serious water shortages since 2020 after COVID-19 pandemic, primarily due to insufficient supply from the Sabah State Water Department's R13 tank and mismanagement. On 12 June 2024, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim approved a RM3 million federal allocation to fund three groundwater drilling and treatment projects at Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) to address the campus's ongoing water crisis. On 14 June 2024, around 80 students from Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and public staged a protest for Kami Mahu Air ("We Want Water") Sabah rally, marching 5 km to Kinabalu Tower without a police permit and demanding to hand a six-point memorandum directly to Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor. Despite Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Shahelmey Yahya offering to receive the memorandum and police informing the students that Chief Minister would meet in the following week, the students refused and insisted on delivering the memorandum directly to Chief Minister.


== History ==


=== 19th century (1994–2000) ===
In its early years of establishment, UMS operated from temporary borrowed facilities with the university's teaching and learning activities conducted at the Sabah Foundation Community College premises in Likas in 1995 and the Menggatal Telekom Training College in 1996. The initial UMS enrolment in 1995 was 205 students at undergraduate study level.
From June 1999 to May 2000, UMS shifted in phases to its permanent campus at Sepanggar Bay. In January 1999, the university expanded its academic reach to the Federal Territory of Labuan with the establishment of the UMS Labuan International Campus (Malay: Universiti Malaysia Sabah Kampus Antarabangsa Labuan, abbreviated as UMSKAL).
In the beginning, study programmes were offered by three schools – the School of Science and Technology, School of Business and Economics and School of Social Sciences – and the Centre for the Promotion of Knowledge and Language Learning, a liberal studies centre.


=== 20th century (2001–present) ===
The number was subsequently expanded to include nine additional schools at the Kota Kinabalu campus namely the School of Engineering and Information Technology, School of Food Science and Nutrition, School of International Tropical Forestry, School of Education and Social Development, School of Psychology and Social Works, and School of Arts Studies.
In F.T. Labuan, programmes were offered through the Labuan School of Informatics Science and School of Business and International Finance. By 2002, UMS had established 11 programmes of study.
In 2003, the number of schools was increased to 12 upon the setting up of the School of Medicine. This was followed by the establishment of the School of Sustainable Agriculture in 2006 which subsequently relocated five years later in 2011 to the UMS Sandakan Campus, its current location.
Other notable initiatives were the establishment of Preparatory Centre for Science and Technology (PPST) in 2010 offering Foundation in Science Programme for Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia high school graduates. PPST began accepting students for its first intake in May 2010 and originally placed under the supervision of the Faculty of Science and Natural Resources until 2013. The launching of the UMS Hospital (HUMS) building project targeted for completion estimated in December 2025. The hospital equipped with 400 beds, 25 operating rooms, 40 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and 145 specialist clinics.


=== 2024 Water Supply Protests ===
On 14 June 2024, around 80 students from Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) led by Suara Mahasiswa UMS organized a protest, Kami Mahu Air ("We Want Water") to highlight ongoing water shortage crisis on campus, which they attributed to administrative negligence and possible corruption within the state government. Sabah Chief Minister Hajiji Noor responded by stating that the situation differed from reports by the Sabah Water Department but assured that the state government would investigate, while Deputy Chief Minister Shahelmey Yahya described the protest as "immature.".


=== 2024 Perhimpunan Aman Gempur Rasuah Sabah ("Peaceful Rally Against Corruption in Sabah") ===

On 31 December 2024, Suara Mahasiswa, a campus-political student movement from UMS, organized Perhimpunan Aman Gempur Rasuah Sabah ("Peaceful Rally Against Corruption in Sabah") in front of Kinabalu Tower. The rally was held to protest against corruption and abuse of power in the state government. Among Suara Mahasiswa UMS demands were the resignation of Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor and a rejection of the appointment of Tun Musa Aman as Yang di-Pertua Negeri due to past corruption allegations. The organizers stated that the movement was non-partisan and urged the public to join in advocating for transparency, accountability, and democratic governance. The group also condemned a counter-rally titled Kami Bersama Hajiji ("We Be With Hajiji"), held at the same time and location, as a provocation intended to distract from the anti-corruption cause.


=== 2025 Perhimpunan Aman Gempur Rasuah Sabah 2.0 ("Peaceful Rally Against Corruption in Sabah 2.0") ===

On 21–22 June 2025, Suara Mahasiswa UMS organized Perhimpunan Aman Gempur Rasuah Sabah 2.0, a student-led anti-corruption rally that began at Suria Sabah and ended with a sit-in at Lintasan Deasoka in Kota Kinabalu. The rally drew around 100 participants and called for improved governance and action on issues such as corruption and water shortages affecting UMS. A controversial moment occurred when students burned a caricature of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, prompting public backlash and police investigations under several laws including the Sedition Act. UMS announced possible disciplinary action against 13 students, with two identified as directly involved in the burning, which the university strongly condemned. In response to criticism, some students defended their actions in Instagram and TikTok as symbolic protest, referencing similar acts by Anwar during his own student activism in the 1970s. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim later urged UMS not to expel the students involved in the rally, emphasizing that students' future and opportunity to complete their studies should be prioritized. The message was conveyed by Higher Education Minister Zambry Abdul Kadir acknowledging the right to assemble is protected under the Malaysian Constitution but should be exercised within the framework of existing laws and university regulations.
