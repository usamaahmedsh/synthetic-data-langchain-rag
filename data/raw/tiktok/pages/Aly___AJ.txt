== History ==


=== 2004–2006: Into the Rush and Acoustic Hearts of Winter ===

In 2004, when Aly was 15 years old and AJ was 13 years old, the duo signed a recording contract with Hollywood Records after an audition in which they performed six original acoustic guitar songs they had written. Aly & AJ's debut studio album, Into the Rush, was released on August 16, 2005. It debuted at number 36 on the US Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in March 2006. The first single released from the album was the cover song "Do You Believe in Magic", originally recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, which was used in the soundtrack of the made-for-TV Disney Channel original movie, Now You See It..., in which Aly had a starring role as Allyson Henlen. "Do You Believe in Magic" peaked at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart. The album's second single, "No One", was featured in the Walt Disney Pictures feature film Ice Princess and its soundtrack. "Walking on Sunshine", a cover of the Katrina and the Waves song, and "Never Far Behind" were released as further singles. The latter appeared on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart, peaking at number 28. On February 28, 2006, the fifth single from the album, "Rush", written with Daniel James and Leah Haywood, was released. The song was their first to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 59. "On the Ride" was released as the album's sixth single on March 7, 2006. It was featured in the Disney Channel Original Movie Cow Belles which starred Aly & AJ.
The sisters were involved in various Walt Disney Records projects. The "Aly & AJ Concert" took place on July 24, 2005, at the Henry Fonda theater in Hollywood, California. The aired concert was cut to five songs. The sisters opened for the Cheetah Girls in December 2005 on the Cheetah-licious Christmas Tour. Into the Rush was re-released in August 2006 with three new songs, including the single "Chemicals React" and new versions of "Collapsed" and "Something More". This version served as their first album release in the United Kingdom. "Chemicals React" peaked at number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100. On September 26, 2006, the sisters released their second studio album, Acoustic Hearts of Winter, which is composed of contemporary recordings of traditional Christmas music. The album debuted at No. 78 on the Billboard Hot 100, selling over 19,000 copies in its first week. The album also charted the U.S. Billboard Top Holiday Albums, debuting at No. 14. In late 2007, the album was reissued with three more Christmas songs.


=== 2007–2008: Insomniatic ===

The duo's third studio album, Insomniatic, was released on July 10, 2007. The album peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200, selling over 39,000 copies in its first week and becoming Aly & AJ's highest debut to date. The album features a more electropop, electronic rock and dance-pop influenced sound different from their debut, with the use of synthesizers, synth-rock guitars, vocoder and electronic instruments. The album was preceded by the lead single "Potential Breakup Song". "Potential Breakup Song" peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their first top 20 single in the United States. The single was certified Platinum by the RIAA for sales surpassing 1 million copies.
In October 2007, both the single and the album were released in the United Kingdom; "Potential Breakup Song" reached a peak position of No. 22 in the United Kingdom and No. 16 in Ireland. Aly & AJ toured for a short while in the UK, opening for McFly twice and performing at several television shows and nightclubs. In the UK, "Potential Breakup Song" was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry. Time magazine named "Potential Breakup Song" one of the 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at No. 9. Writer Josh Tyrangiel praised the authenticity of its having been written by the teenage sisters who sing it. The single also charted in several other European countries, performing moderately in the Netherlands, Norway, and Scotland.
In December 2007, for two weeks, the band was the opening act for Miley Cyrus's Best of Both Worlds Tour. In early January 2008, Aly & AJ performed a cover of KT Tunstall's "Black Horse and the Cherry Tree" on Yahoo's Pepsi Smash video site. The cover, recorded at Abbey Road Studios, was featured on the Japanese re-release of Insomniatic. In March 2008, "Like Whoa" was released as the second single from Insomniatic and peaked at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was also used to promote the Disney Channel Original Movie Minutemen. That year, Aly & AJ covered the Grand Funk Railroad song "We're an American Band" for Randy Jackson's Music Club, Vol. 1.


=== 2009–2016: Departure from Hollywood Records, 78violet ===

In early 2008, Aly & AJ were working on a fourth studio album under Hollywood Records which was due to be released in late 2009. They mentioned in an interview with Radio Disney on April 23, 2008, that they were going for a "rockier" sound, and that this time they wanted to sing separately, not harmonizing their voices as they had on their previous albums, to let fans identify which Michalka sister was singing. In December 2008, the duo wrote a song (later confirmed to be titled "The Next Worst Thing") with Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo.
On July 8, 2009, the duo changed their name to 78violet. They continued to work on their fourth Hollywood Records album, which was later completed, but its release was delayed numerous times. In May 2010, the duo announced that they had departed from the label, and the album was shelved. On November 30, 2010, the first song under the 78violet name was released on the Hellcats soundtrack EP. 78violet recorded the theme song to Hellcats, titled "Belong Here". Some of the titles being considered for 78violet's fourth album were 8 Hours and 53rd floor. On May 2, 2013, Aly & AJ signed to Red Light Management. The single "Hothouse" was released on July 8, 2013. The duo performed live for the first time in five years with a concert at the Roxy Theater in Los Angeles on June 26. The group announced that they would be releasing an EP in early 2014, however, this never materialized. The full Hothouse EP was leaked in its entirety in 2014; the duo released it on vinyl as Sanctuary: Vol. 1 in 2020 for first-year subscribers of their Sanctuary fan-club.
In December 2015, the sisters changed their band name back to Aly & AJ.


=== 2017–2022: Return to music ===
"Take Me", a new single, served as the lead single from their EP Ten Years, and was released on August 17, 2017. The accompanying music video was released on September 14, 2017. The Ten Years EP was released on November 17, 2017. Two tracks from the EP, "I Know" and "The Distance", were featured in season 4 of Aly's TV series iZombie.

The duo released the singles "Attack of Panic" in February 2020, and "Joan of Arc on the Dance Floor" in May. In December 2020, songs from both Ten Years and Sanctuary, as well as the non-album singles, were later released onto a compilation album titled We Don't Stop.
Their fourth studio album, A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun, was released on May 7, 2021. The album was preceded by the singles "Slow Dancing" on December 2, 2020, and "Listen!!!" in January 2021. Following the growing popularity of "Potential Breakup Song" on the social media app TikTok, Aly & AJ released two re-recorded versions of the song in December 2020: one with clean lyrics and an explicit version. In July 2021, the duo performed at Lollapalooza for the first time. Following the re-recording of "Potential Breakup Song", the duo released re-recordings of their songs "Like Whoa" and "Chemicals React" in 2022, subtitled "(A&A Version)". In October 2022, they performed at Austin City Limits.

== Activism ==
The duo has used their platform for political advocacy, including support of LGBTQ+ rights, voter registration, Black Lives Matter, Planned Parenthood, and support for certain candidates in the Democratic Party.
In a post on Twitter in January 2017, the duo expressed support for Planned Parenthood. In 2019, the duo partnered with HeadCount, enabling voter registration at the duo's concerts. The duo also partnered with The Trevor Project, an organization dedicated to youth suicide prevention in the LGBTQ+ community. They also partnered with Project HEAL, a charity dedicated to increasing access to treatment for eating disorders. The duo donated signed merchandise and other memorabilia to raise funds for these causes.
In April 2019, in an op-ed published in Paper magazine, the sisters revealed their struggles with depression and anxiety to raise awareness and remove stigma around mental health medication. The piece also highlighted the struggles of LGBTQ+ youth. In February 2020, the duo released single "Attack of Panic", which dealt with themes of anxiety and panic attacks.
In May 2020, they released a music video for their single "Joan of Arc on the Dance Floor", directed by Aly and her husband, Stephen Ringer, that featured clips of Republican members of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary who were responsible for the 2018 Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh after sexual assault allegations against him. The video's credits thank his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, and Anita Hill, who accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in 1991 prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States. Also in May 2020, the duo expressed support for Black Lives Matter in a post on Twitter.
In June 2020, the duo hosted an all-night fundraising live stream, "Up All Night with Aly & AJ", which included a full live concert, acoustic performances, reactions to their earlier work and conversations with friends and collaborators, promoting donations to charities via Propeller.la. The stream raised US$30,000 for 13 charities, featuring one every hour: Color of Change, Frontline Foods, National Independent Venue Association's Save our Stages, Project HEAL, Women's History Museum, The Art of Elysium, The Trevor Project, Nalleli Cobo, GLAAD, Sierra Club, MusiCares, The Beauty Bus Foundation, and the Red Cross.

They also supported Joe Biden in the general election of the 2020 United States presidential election.
In summer 2021, via Propeller.la, the duo offered a chance for a fan who supported their causes to meet them.

=== Acting ===
The duo have both pursued separate acting careers outside of their music, as well as having starred in some joint projects. Most notably, the pair starred as sisters in the 2006 Disney Channel Original movie Cow Belles, with "On the Ride" from their debut album Into The Rush serving as the movie's theme song. The sisters also starred in a Disney Channel television pilot Haversham Hall, although the show was not picked up for series. In 2015, the pair starred together in Weepah Way for Now, an independent comedy-drama film which premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival. The film was produced by the duo and written & directed by Aly's husband Stephen Ringer. The pair played sisters again in the movie, with the characters loosely based on their own personalities and relationship. They were featured in the March 7, 2022, episode "Yippee Ki-Yay" of The Good Doctor as a fractured sister act.


=== Branded merchandise ===

== Personal lives ==


=== Stalking incidents ===
In June 2008, Rex Mettler, from Lancaster, Ohio, was arrested for stalking the duo. He "obtained contact information for the acting and singing duo and made threats online, by phone and handwritten notes" as stated by the police. The duo was scheduled to perform in Cincinnati on June 27, 2008, where the man was present, after which the police could not confirm that any of the threats involved the Ohio show. The police later stated that "the charge against Mettler stems from incidents that began December 15, 2007" and that "Rex displayed a pattern of activity over that time that reflected multiple attempts, if not numerous attempts, at stalking these females."
In June 2010, Caesar Brantley was arrested on suspicion of stalking the duo near their home in a gated community in Calabasas, California, in violation of a restraining order that the duo had against the man. He pleaded not guilty.


=== Religion ===
Along with making music for the mainstream audience, Aly & AJ, who are both very open about their faith, were significant in the Christian music rock scene. "Never Far Behind" was only released on Christian rock radio. It reached No. 1 on Radio & Records (R&R) Christian CHR. The duo does not wish to be labeled as Christian music artists.
In 2006, the duo said that they did not believe in evolution. However, in a post on Twitter in March 2019, the duo affirmed that they do believe in evolution. In 2013, Aly said that she supported school prayer, as long as it is voluntary.
In May 2019, the duo said that their faith had gotten stronger but that they are never trying to push a certain agenda with their music.
