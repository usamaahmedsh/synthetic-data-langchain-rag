Showcase Cinemas is a movie theater chain owned and operated by Paramount Skydance Corporation. It operates in the United States, Brazil (under the UCI Cinemas brand), the United Kingdom, and Argentina.


== Operations ==
Showcase operates a total of 16 theaters in the United States: nine in the Greater Boston area within Massachusetts, and a further two in Rhode Island; four in the New York City suburbs; and one in Springdale, Ohio. These theaters operate under the brands Showcase Cinemas, Cinema de Lux, and (in the sole case of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts) Showcase SuperLux. Several now-shuttered locations in New York City formerly operated under the name Multiplex Cinemas. The Cinema de Lux brand was established in 2008 to denote locations that offered in-theater dining options and full bars with seat delivery service. All locations are wheelchair accessible and offer assistance devices for hearing- and sight-impaired customers.
Internationally, Showcase operates 8 theaters in Argentina, 29 in Brazil, and 16 in the United Kingdom.
