Universal Television Alternative Studio UK (formerly known as Monkey Kingdom) is a British television production company based in London, United Kingdom, with offices in Los Angeles. Established by David Granger and Will MacDonald in 2000, the company was acquired by NBCUniversal in 2010. Monkey was NBCUniversal's third UK production venture following the acquisition of Carnival and the launch of WTTV, NBCUniversal's joint venture with Working Title Films, Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner.
The company creates, develops, produces, and sells entertainment and factual programming in the United Kingdom and the United States. It can be a live studio, structured reality, factual, documentary, entertainment, scripted comedy, digital and brand-driven content.
These include reality show Made in Chelsea,  reality/quiz hybrid The Question Jury (the best Daytime Programme 2017), music entertainment show TFI Friday, comedy show The Charlotte Church Show, The Real Housewives of Cheshire, Elton John: Me, Myself & I, The House of Obsessive Compulsives, and hidden camera fixed-rig comedy show Make My Day, and comedy sketch series Swinging.
The company has received several nominations and awards from BAFTA, Rose d'Or, International Emmy, RTS Award, The Comedy Awards and Broadcast Awards for their productions. These include the award-winning structured reality TV show Made in Chelsea, TFI Friday, Elton John: Me, Myself & I, award-winning game show The Question Jury and The Real Housewives of Cheshire.
In 2018, Monkey released the first all-black, all-female line-up on a British TV panel show, Don’t Hate the Playaz. This marked to be an achievement in the entertainment industry as 40% of the senior team of "Made in Chelsea" now comprises individuals from black, Asian, or other minority ethnic backgrounds.
In May 2025 when Monkey Kingdom's parent company Universal International Studios announced its layoffs, they moved their British production company Monkey Kingdom to Universal Studio Group's American unscripted television division Universal Television Alternative Studio, giving them their own British unscripted arm and had it rebranded British production company Monkey Kingdom to Universal Television Alternative Studio UK (UTAS UK) effectively retired the Monkey Kingdom name after 25 years with Monkey Kingdom's production staff being placed under UTAS's team.
Other than that, Monkey has produced shows for the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, IKEA, and Amnesty International.
Before founding Monkey, David Granger and Will MacDonald produced International Emmy/BAFTA/Rose d'Or-winning Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, TFI Friday, The Priory, Lock, Stock..., MTV's Most Wanted and The Big Breakfast.
