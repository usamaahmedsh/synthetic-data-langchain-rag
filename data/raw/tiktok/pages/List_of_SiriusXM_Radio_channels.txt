The following is a list of channels on both the American and Canadian versions of SiriusXM. There are over 150 full-time channels on SiriusXM, most of which are on SiriusXM Canada, with additional channels (including App-only Xtra music channels) streaming through the SiriusXM app and on connected devices.
Not included are channels that are specifically used for live sports programming (most of the News, Talk and Comedy channels are usually preempted for sports play-by-play), as well as pop-up music channels (not counting seasonal holiday channels) and even music channels that merged between some duplicated music channels from both Sirius and XM radio.


== Current channels ==
Updated as of 2 November 2025. Different line-ups on this list may differ for the Canadian area, with some channels available within the radio, going further apart from the American market.
Some channels, however, are marked with an [E], meaning it will play songs containing explicit language or mature programming that may be offensive to many listeners. Family-friendly plans will come later, and will alter most of the songs or programming for a clean station.
