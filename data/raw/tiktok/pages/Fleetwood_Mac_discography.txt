The discography of British-American band Fleetwood Mac consists of 18 studio albums, 10 live albums, 23 compilation albums, one extended play and 62 singles. The band has also sold over 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
The 1967–1969 era Blue Horizon albums (Fleetwood Mac, Mr. Wonderful, The Pious Bird of Good Omen, and Fleetwood Mac in Chicago) and the 1971 outtakes album The Original Fleetwood Mac have been remastered and reissued on CD, as have the 1975–1987 era Warner Bros. studio albums (Fleetwood Mac, Rumours, Tusk, Mirage, and Tango in the Night). In 2020, the remaining albums from 1969 to 1974 (Then Play On, Kiln House, Future Games, Bare Trees, Penguin, Mystery to Me, and Heroes are Hard to Find) were remastered and released in a CD box set, which also included a previously unreleased live concert from 15 December 1974.
In 2013, a deluxe edition of Rumours was released. The same year, Then Play On was remastered and reissued on CD. Reissues of Then Play On, Kiln House, Future Games and Bare Trees were released on vinyl, initially bundled with a 7″ single of "Oh Well, Parts I & II", then released separately in 2014.  In 2015, a five-CD/one-DVD/two-LP deluxe edition, a three-CD expanded edition, plus a one-CD remaster of Tusk was released. In 2016, multiple remastered editions of Mirage were released. A 30th anniversary edition of Tango in the Night was released 31 March 2017.
