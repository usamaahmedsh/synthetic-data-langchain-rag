LiveNow from Fox (stylized as LiveNOW from FOX) is a streaming video television network operated by Fox Television Stations, a division of Fox Corporation. The channel carries live coverage of breaking news events throughout the day on several streaming and smart TV platforms.
On-air hosts include Andy Mac, Austin Westfall, Carel Lajara, Christina Evans, Christy Matino, J Russell, Josh Breslow, Mike Pache and Stephanie Coueignoux.


== Operation ==
The programming is often handled by a single digital journalist who simultaneously narrates live coverage and operates a video switcher, leveraging resources, on-air talent and raw material from the Fox News Channel and its local news affiliates.
The digital journalists work out of Fox's owned-and-operated stations in Phoenix, Arizona (KSAZ-TV) and Orlando, Florida (WOFL), presenting an estimated 100 hours a week of live coverage.


== History ==
The service originated as Fox 10 News Now, a webcast that had been run by KSAZ-TV in 2014. It gained a large following on YouTube in 2016 when it carried president Donald Trump's rallies and other live events uninterrupted and in their entirety.
In 2020, the channel transitioned and rebranded to a national product called News Now from Fox. Later that year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the channel rebranded to "CoronavirusNow," dedicating itself to coverage of the pandemic. Later that year, it took on its current name and format.
