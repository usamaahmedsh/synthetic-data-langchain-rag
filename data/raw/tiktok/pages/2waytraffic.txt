2waytraffic was a television production company based in Hilversum, Netherlands. It was established in 2004 by former Endemol executives Kees Abrahams, Unico Glorie, Taco Ketelaar, and Henk Keilman. The company had offices in London, New York, Budapest, Stockholm, and Madrid.
2waytraffic also produced a number of phone-in quiz shows such as Play, Garito and Game On, where viewers could call to a premium-rate phone number for a theoretical chance to earn cash prizes.


== History ==
The company expanded significantly in 2006 with three acquisitions, beginning with Emexus, which provides a technology platform for content aggregation and service and applications delivery in the fields of mobile marketing, mobile entertainment and mobile Internet, in June and then the content developer Intellygents in August. The most notable acquisition, however, was that of the rights of the UK company Celador International and its programme library, including the international Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? franchise, on December 1, 2006.
On March 14, 2007, Celador International Limited was relaunched as 2waytraffic International.


=== Sony era ===
On June 4, 2008, 2waytraffic was acquired by 2JS Productions, a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment. On September 29, 2waytraffic became the distributor of the entertainment formats by SPTI.
On April 1, 2009, Sony Pictures Entertainment consolidated its US and international television companies under the SPT roof such as: 2waytraffic, Embassy Row, Starling, Teleset, and Lean-M. Sony Pictures Television International now operates in-name-only.
In April 2012, 2waytraffic was renamed "Sony Pictures Television International Formats", with the 2waytraffic logo being replaced in next years by the Sony Pictures Television logo on internationally licensed shows, where the 2waytraffic brand was discontinued in 2013. It's currently an in-name-only unit of Sony Pictures Television, with copyrights to 2waytraffic's formats currently being assigned to CPT Holdings, Inc., one of the companies behind Sony Pictures Television.
