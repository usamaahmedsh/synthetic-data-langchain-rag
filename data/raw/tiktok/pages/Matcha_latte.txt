Matcha latte (抹茶ラテ) is a beverage made by combining matcha, a powdered green tea originating from Japan, with milk or a milk substitute. It can be served hot or iced and is considered a tea-based counterpart to the traditional coffee latte. Matcha lattes rose to international prominence in the 2020s due to social media visibility, expansion by major cafe chains, and their association with wellness-oriented lifestyle aesthetics.


== History ==


=== Origins in Japan ===
Matcha, a powdered form of green tea that originated in China, was introduced to Japan in the late 12th century by the Zen monk Eisai, who brought tea seeds and knowledge of powdered tea preparation from China. In Japan, matcha was initially consumed in monasteries and later became closely associated with Zen Buddhist practice and elite tea gatherings during the medieval period.
These practices developed into the Japanese tea ceremony, known as chanoyu or chadō (“the way of tea”), in which matcha is prepared by whisking powdered tea with hot water using a bamboo whisk.
As matcha spread globally in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, new ways of consuming it emerged, including sweetened beverages such as the modern matcha latte.


=== Introduction to Western cafés ===
The modern matcha latte is a Western adaptation that emerged in cafés in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Its growth accelerated when Starbucks introduced its matcha latte in 2006, followed by Dunkin' with its own version in 2020. These chains helped mainstream the drink among younger consumers.


=== Popularity on social media ===
The drink became widely popular in the 2020s due to its visibility on TikTok and Instagram, where influencers showcased brightly colored matcha beverages as part of “clean” and wellness-focused aesthetics. In the United Kingdom, Blank Street Coffee has been credited with helping popularize the drink.
Some tea specialists have criticized commercial matcha lattes for using lower-grade green tea powder instead of ceremonial-grade matcha. Reports from Japan have also warned of shortages linked to increased global demand for matcha, especially ceremonial grades.  The rapid growth in global demand has also led to increased concerns about counterfeit matcha and market instability, with reports describing the modern matcha trade as “the Wild West” due to fraud and inflated resale prices. Critics argue that Western consumers sometimes misunderstand the drink, treating it primarily as a trend while overlooking its cultural and ceremonial roots.   


== Preparation ==
A matcha latte is prepared by whisking matcha or green tea powder with a small amount of hot water to form a concentrated mixture. Milk or a milk substitute such as oat, almond, or soy milk is then added. The drink may be sweetened using sugar, simple syrup, honey, or vanilla.


== Characteristics ==
The beverage is known for its bright green color, creamy texture, and slightly grassy taste. It has been described by Vogue as an appealing alternative to coffee, especially among consumers seeking a beverage associated with wellness culture.


== Variations ==
Matcha lattes commonly appear in several variations, including:

Iced matcha lattes, often shaken with ice
Flavored versions, such as vanilla, lavender, or brown sugar 
Layered fruit drinks, including strawberry matcha and banana matcha lattes popularized on social media
Matcha-espresso "dirty matcha," which combines matcha with a shot of espresso
Matcha has also appeared in desserts, pancakes, mousse, and bubble tea as part of its rise in global food culture.


== Commercialization ==
Matcha lattes have become widely available across major cafe chains, independent coffee shops, and wellness brands. The popularity has coincided with increased marketing of matcha as a "health-conscious" alternative to coffee.


== Social connotations ==
In 2025, posts on social media platforms began to associate the matcha latte with an online masculine archetype known as the “performative male.”
