The third single from the album, "Colors", was released on February 9, 2016, and became the album's most streamed track on Spotify; it also became the album's best-selling track worldwide.

== Composition ==
The name "Badlands" refers to Halsey's state of mind while writing the album, to give a physical place as a metaphor for a desolate and lonely mind. Musically, it is a pop album in the styles of electropop, alternative pop, dark pop, and synth-pop with industrial undertones.


== Production ==
According to Halsey, Badlands is a concept album focusing on the fictional dystopian society known as The Badlands. A desert wasteland surrounds the city, keeping the inhabitants of The Badlands captive. The album was inspired by post-apocalyptic films such as The Fifth Element. After writing the first few songs, Halsey realized the entire concept was a metaphor for her mental state. Halsey states she created the Badlands to escape from her real-life struggles. In her opinion, the metaphor was even with no escape, there is still hope there is somewhere else to go. Lido served as the album's executive producer.

== Critical reception ==

In a review for Pitchfork, Nathan Reese wrote, "Reading interviews with Halsey you get the sense of a canny and talented performer, one who legitimately wants to connect with fans. But the public persona only comes through on Badlands in fits and starts, and there isn't a single subversive or original second on the album." About the chorus on "New Americana", he commented, "Like most of Badlands, it's calculated, defiant, and, ultimately, hollow." In a short review, Rolling Stone's Joe Levy called Halsey a "new popstar with a knack for sticky imagery". The album was included at number six on Rock Sound's top 50 releases of 2015 list.
