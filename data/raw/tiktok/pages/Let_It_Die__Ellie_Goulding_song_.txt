== Background ==
“Let It Die” is a song by singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding for her fifth studio album, Higher Than Heaven. It's the album’s third single and the first with Goulding as the only main artist credited, with the first two being "Easy Lover" featuring Big Sean, and "All by Myself" with Alok and Sigala. She first teased the song through a TikTok snippet back on October 14, 2022.

Speaking about the song to Genius, Goulding said: "Let it Die happened in a day with Tom Mann and LostBoy. I love working with them because we're all on the same page with our love of pop & electronic music but still wanting to have a deeper meaning in the theme and lyrics.
Pete [Lostboy] played us a beat and Tom & I seemed to know pretty quickly how the melody should go, and lyrically I knew it needed to be something dark & empowering at the same time. Letting go of a toxic relationship is hard so sometimes you just have to cut the cord and drive away, instead of stringing it out for the hurt to build & build. I don’t know anyone who hasn't been in this situation or doesn’t know someone who has."


== Music video ==
A music video for "Let It Die" was released the same day as the song worldwide, to her Vevo channel on YouTube. The music video was directed by Carlota Guerrero, and features Goulding in the White Cube Art Gallery, interacting with several dancers.

The video received an age restriction from YouTube on its day of release, this came after the singer shows a nipple in the video. As 11 January 2023, the video has over 800k views.
