== Overview ==
In 2022, Utah influencer Taylor Frankie Paul went viral for revealing that she and her husband had been "soft-swinging" with other Mormon couples. The series begins months later as Taylor and her group of influencer friends, dubbed "MomTok," deal with the fallout of the scandal.
Once seen as a picture-perfect collective of supportive mothers and content creators, the group begins to unravel as trust is broken, alliances shift, and personal secrets come to light. As Taylor becomes both a pariah and a lightning rod for attention, the other women are forced to confront their own roles in the drama and decide where their loyalties lie.
Beyond the scandal, the series offers a unique look at the world of Mormon motherhood and social media fame as the group seeks to break barriers while balancing their public image, religious expectations, and the demands of family life.

=== Critical response ===
David Oliver of USA Today praised The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives for its effective mix of elements from Gossip Girl, The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, and Mean Girls. He found the series engaging, highlighting its focus on themes like friendship, faith, infidelity, and scandal within a group of Mormon influencers. Oliver noted that the show stands out for its candid portrayal of issues such as sex, divorce, and emotional abuse, presenting a bold and honest depiction of Mormon women confronting societal expectations. Samantha Nungesser of Decider stated that The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives lives up to its reputation by keeping viewers fully engaged with its dramatic twists. Nungesser found the focus on Paul's swinging scandal and arrest particularly interesting, especially noting the shocking body-cam footage. She praised the series for effectively blending personal drama, such as marital struggles and trust issues, with insights into Mormon culture. Highlighting intense moments like Jen's marital threats and Whitney's departure from "#MomTok," Nungesser described the show as a must-watch reality series filled with scandal and emotion. Yonni Uribe of SLUG Magazine complimented The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives for sparking discussions about Mormonism and personal authenticity, despite initial concerns about its portrayal of the religion. They concluded with enthusiasm for the show's engaging drama and anticipation for future seasons. While Jessica Grose of The New York Times noted that the series was "being sold as regular reality TV dreck", she did not expect the series' deeper theme of religious conflict within the Latter Day Saint community, specifically with women who struggle to balance the traditional values of Mormonism with the modern values of greater society in the 21st century.
Sarah Stiefvater of PureWow described The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives as a captivating reality series that she binge-watched in a single day. She praised the show for its blend of scandal, personal drama, and distinctive Mormon culture. Stiefvater highlighted the series's authentic portrayal of the complex struggles among the women of "#MomTok," noting its contrast to the more contrived drama of other reality TV series. She appreciated the mix of piety and hypocrisy, particularly in the dynamics between Taylor Frankie Paul and Whitney Leavitt, and valued the genuine moments of female solidarity. Despite the show's quirks and the sometimes questionable decisions of its cast, Stiefvater found it to be "reality TV gold" and eagerly anticipates the next season.  Monica Hesse of The Washington Post said that The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives highlights the irony of social media influencers who promote traditional homemaking while secretly being the primary earners. Hesse found that, despite its "petty dramas" and "trash buffet" feel, the show effectively exposes the effort these women put into maintaining the illusion of domesticity. She praised the series for revealing the contradictions between the influencers' public personas and private realities, noting that their apparent self-subjugation is intertwined with self-possession in their successful careers. Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast asserted that The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives captures viewers with its chaotic mix of reality TV tropes, finding the cast's pursuit of fame both baffling and irresistible. Fallon noted that the show's tone is inconsistent and its storytelling shallow, particularly in how it glosses over major plot points such as the swinger scandal. Despite these shortcomings, Fallon complimented the series for being oddly captivating, drawing him into its web of drama, confusion, and intrigue, and leaving Fallon wanting more despite his initial reservations.


=== LDS Church response ===
On August 16, 2024, ahead of the series' release, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) released the following statement on their website:

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, like other prominent global faith communities, often finds itself the focus of the attention of the entertainment industry. Some portrayals are fair and accurate, but others resort to stereotypes or gross misrepresentations that are in poor taste and have real-life consequences for people of faith. While this is not new, a number of recent productions depict lifestyles and practices blatantly inconsistent with the teachings of the Church.
They also spoke to the fascination that viewers have with the LDS Church, stating:

We understand the fascination some in the media have with the Church, but regret that portrayals often rely on sensationalism and inaccuracies that do not fairly and fully reflect the lives of our Church members or the sacred beliefs that they hold dear.
A Change.org petition urging Hulu to cancel the series was created prior to the series' premiere.
Along with the LDS Church, several leaders within the faith have spoken against the nature of the show and its virality, specifically what it means for the public perception of its followers. Jennifer Finlayson-Fife, a sex therapist and marriage counselor, stated that the show could "feed the fantasies" of outsiders who believe LDS Church members do not believe in chastity and fidelity.
In an opinion piece for the Deseret News, which is owned by the LDS Church, Sarah Jane Weaver stated, "The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives is not a representation of me or my friends or my daughters or their friends or of the women I have met across the globe. It simply is not. My invitation and plea to any media writing about these women is simple. There are millions of Latter-day Saint women who live their faith differently than these outliers being promoted online. They are smart, educated, funny and content. Find them, talk to them and tell their stories."
Lindsay Arnold, a member of the LDS Church, stated, "I think there's a lot of people out there mad about the show, upset about it. I honestly really don't feel any of those things. I watched. I was entertained."
