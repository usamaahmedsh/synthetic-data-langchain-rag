2K Los Angeles (formerly Kush Games, Inc.) was an American video game developer based in Camarillo, California. Founded by Umrao Mayer in 1998, the company was part of Visual Concepts, which itself was a part of Sega. Both Kush Games and Visual Concepts were sold to Take-Two Interactive and subsequently became part of their new 2K label. Kush Games was renamed 2K Los Angeles in February 2007 before being shut down in 2008.

Kush Games was founded by Umrao Mayer in 1998 to develop sports games. Kush Games was acquired by Sega in 2004 and became part of Visual Concepts. On January 24, 2005, Visual Concepts and Kush Games were acquired by Take-Two Interactive for US$24 million. A total of US$32.2 million had been paid to Sega for the acquisition of Visual Concepts and affiliated properties by January 2006. On January 25, 2005, the day following the acquisition, Take-Two Interactive announced their new publishing label, 2K, which would henceforth manage Visual Concepts and Kush Games.
In February 2007, Kush Games was rebranded 2K Los Angeles. By August 2007, Mayer had been succeeded as president by Graeme Bayless. Mayer, together with partner George Simmons, went on to found Zindagi Games in 2008. 2K Los Angeles was shut down that same year.
