A candle warmer is an electric device that heats a candle or scented wax (such as wax melts) to release fragrance without an open flame.  They typically use either a hot plate or an overhead lamp as the heat source and include a stand or tray for the candle jar or wax.  Candle warmers eliminate many fire hazards associated with open-flame candles; however, a 2025 American Chemical Society study indicates that scented wax melts warmed in these devices can still degrade indoor air quality.


== History ==
Early accessories called “candle warmers” used a candle’s own flame to warm food or drink; an Art-Deco food warmer designed by Peter Mueller-Munk in 1949 is one example.  
Electrical candle-heating devices appeared by the early 1950s, as shown by a 1952 U.S. patent for a “cover for a candle warmer.”  
The modern consumer product was popularised in 2001, when Candle Warmers Etc. introduced a mug-warmer-style hot plate for jar candles after a candle-related house fire prompted a search for safer fragrance methods.  
In 2003, Scentsy launched a direct-sales model built around plug-in wax warmers and wickless scented wax, broadening public awareness.  
Decorative candle-lamp warmers became popular in the 2010s; by 2024 the hashtag #CandleWarmer had exceeded 170 million views on TikTok.


== Design and technology ==


=== Heating mechanisms ===
Plate warmers use an electric resistive element beneath a metal or ceramic plate to heat the candle from below.
Lamp warmers position a halogen or incandescent bulb above the candle, melting the top layer of wax while providing ambient light.
2-in-1 models accept either a candle jar on the plate or wax melts in a detachable dish.


=== Materials and safety features ===
Warmers employ heat-resistant ceramics or metals and typically carry UL/ETL or CE certification.  Modern units often add auto shut-off timers, dimmers or thermostats, and over-temperature fuses.  Manufacturers warn against using certain vegetable-wax candles on high-heat plates to avoid jar rupture.


== Global usage and market ==
Industry analysts valued the candle-warmers segment at roughly US$320 million in 2023 and project it to exceed US$450 million by the early 2030s.  North America accounts for ≈38 % of revenue, followed by Asia–Pacific (~25 %) and Europe (~22 %).  Growth drivers include home-wellness trends and social-media exposure.  Major brands are Candle Warmers Etc., Scentsy, ScentSationals/Rimports, Yankee Candle, and Bath & Body Works.


== Advantages ==
Fire safety – no open flame drastically reduces ignition risk.
No soot or smoke – eliminates combustion by-products.
Even fragrance throw – melts a larger wax surface than a flame.
Extended candle life – jar candles can emit fragrance for up to five times longer on a warmer.
Lower long-term cost – reusable device; inexpensive wax-melt refills.
Decor and lighting – lamp styles double as ambient lighting.


== Disadvantages ==
Reduced ambiance – lacks natural flame flicker.
Up-front cost – US$10–50 per device.
Outlet dependency – requires electricity.
Faster fragrance depletion – wax loses scent sooner, leaving unscented residue.
Indoor-air VOCs – 2025 ACS study showed wax-melt VOCs forming ultrafine particles comparable to those from burning candles.


== Safety considerations ==
Place warmers on stable, heat-resistant surfaces away from combustibles.
Use UL/ETL-certified devices and follow manufacturer instructions.
Avoid overheating vegetable-wax candles, which can pressurise and crack jars.


=== Indoor air quality ===
While warmers remove soot and smoke, they do not eliminate all emissions.  A Purdue University study in Environmental Science & Technology Letters found that warming terpene-rich wax melts generated secondary organic aerosol nanoparticles.  Researchers concluded that “flame-free does not mean pollution-free.”
