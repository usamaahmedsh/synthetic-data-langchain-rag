While a freshman at Georgia State University, Bah began posting GRWM videos on TikTok in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. She became known on the platform for her maximalist, "cute-but-tough" style inspired by Harajuku fashion and Y2K fashion, consisting primarily of pink items, Hello Kitty memorabilia, belts, fur, boots, garters, bikini tops, leg warmers, earmuffs, miniskirts, necklaces, and fishnets, which she dubbed "AliyahCore" in late 2022. Her tweet featuring a picture of her wearing a bikini and Moon Boots together also went viral in November 2022. By November 2023, the hashtag #Aliyahcore had over 400 million views on TikTok.

In September 2023, she appeared in the music video for Doja Cat's song "Agora Hills". Also that month, she self-released her debut single, "It Girl". The house-pop song quickly went viral on TikTok, where it soundtracked more than 912,000 videos by November 2023. Her follow-up singles, "Fashion Icon" and "Love Me", were released in February and June 2024, respectively. She was also included on TikTok's Black Visionary Voices list for 2024.
