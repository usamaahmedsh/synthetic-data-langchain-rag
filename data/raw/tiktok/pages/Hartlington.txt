The road then turns into Hartlington Moor Lane, which goes up to Grimwith Reservoir.
Hartlington is one of the contenders for the smallest and least populous village in the Yorkshire Dales, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for its outstanding natural beauty – and even though it is small, it and the surrounding villages are at the centre of attention of hikers and tourists. Hartlington is home to Burnsall Park, which is a very popular spot for tourists and residents of the nearby towns and villages to visit and relax on the banks of the River Wharfe. In 2022, the park went viral on the social media platform TikTok, which has caused the park to receive an influx of customers.
Until 1974 it was part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. From 1974 to 2023 it was part of the district of Craven, it is now administered by the unitary North Yorkshire Council.
