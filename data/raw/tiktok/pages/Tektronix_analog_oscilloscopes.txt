Tektronix was founded in the mid-1940s to produce oscilloscopes. This list of analog oscilloscopes attempts to present all oscilloscopes made by Tektronix from the 1950s to the 1990s, including technical data and accessories.


== 400 series ==

In the 1960s, Tektronix introduced the relatively compact 450 series of portable oscilloscopes, starting with the 50 MHz 453. The 453 was superseded by the 454. In addition, Tektronix also made the 15 MHz 422 AC/DC portable.
The 450 series was succeeded by the 460, 470, and 480 series. Each new model offered increased bandwidth and improved triggering. However, these oscilloscopes remained too heavy for portable use, and their chassis were complex and costly to manufacture.
The 400 series oscilloscopes were notable for their wide variety of optional choices. For example, the available bandwidth ranged from 500 kHz to 400 MHz.
In 1988, prices for the most basic models were approximately $2,000, whereas more advanced models like the 2467 with microchannel plate cathode ray tube (MCP CRT) could be more than $12,000.


== 500 series ==


=== 501 oscilloscope ===
The first digit in this model's number, '5', represents the diameter of the device screen. Compared to competing products from Dumont, RCA, and Varian, the 501 was large in size and weight.


=== 511 oscilloscope ===
The 511 was introduced to address the size and weight of the 501. This model was designed by Howard Vollum, Milt Bave, and others.


=== 515A oscilloscope ===
The Tektronix 515 was a 15 MHz single-trace, all-tube oscilloscope introduced in 1955. After the first 900 units were manufactured, the model was updated and given the '500A' moniker.
The 515A provided two vertical inputs. Using a selector switch, the signal of one of the vertical inputs could be displayed as a function of time. Additionally, the 515A provided a horizontal input. The signal of the horizontal input could be combined with the signal of one of the vertical inputs and displayed as an x-y plot.


=== 547 oscilloscope ===
The 547 was a single beam, dual trace, vacuum tube type oscilloscope introduced in 1968 at the cost of $1,875. It was popular mainly because of its "ALT" mode, which allowed for dual traces to be shown on a single beam oscilloscope, providing much of the functionality of dual beam scopes for a fraction of the cost.
The 547 achieved this through an electronic switch, in front of the vertical system, that could display two separate electrical signals on the screen. This required only a few parts of the oscilloscope to be duplicated in the device and therefore increased the cost by only a small amount. This technique was also used in all dual and four-trace plug-ins such as the CA, 1A1, 1A2, Type M, and 1A4.


== 2000 series ==

The first 2000-series Tektronix portable oscilloscopes, which were introduced in the 1982 catalog, were the 2213, 2215, 2335, 2336, and 2337. They could withstand impacts of up to 50g, which was an improvement over the 500 series. This was achieved mainly through simplification of circuit design and a lightweight switching power supply. They were significantly lighter than the 400-series.
The main limitation of these early models was bandwidth. This was addressed in 1984 with the introduction of the 2465 and the smaller 2445. Both models had 4 channels. The 2465 had a bandwidth of 300 MHz, with triggering to match. Both the 2465 and the 2445 were microprocessor-driven and firmware-controlled, as opposed to the 2200 and 2300 models. In 1989, the 2465B was introduced, which improved bandwidth to 400 MHz bandwidth with triggering beyond 500 MHz.
The  2000-series reached its peak circa 1984, when there were no less than 21 models introduced and a total of 33 models offered. The 2430, the 2432A, the 2465B, and the 2467B lasted until 1996. By the time the 1997 catalog was introduced, there were no longer any 2000-series listed, marking the end of a 14 year production run.
The main differences among the non-storage, non-digital (analog) 2000 series are as follows: the 2200 series was mostly 2-channel, with 2245, 2246, 2247, and 2252 being the 4-channel exceptions (the two extra channels having only two vertical attenuation values). The 2335 and 2336 were 2-channel, ruggedized versions mostly made for the military. The 2400 series were 4-channel, 2 of the channels having full attenuators. Otherwise, the main difference was bandwidth. The 2200 series was 20 - 100 MHz. The 2400 series started out at 150 MHz (2445, 2445A) but went up with the 2445B; 150 MHz for early units, 200 MHz for later units. The 2465 had a bandwidth of 300 MHz, the 2465A 350 MHz, the 2465B 400 MHz.
The 2467 is a special case, having a micro-channel plate (MCP) CRT. This oscilloscope offers extremely high speed writing, making one-shot pulses at nanosecond duration visible in normal room light. From that aspect, it was the only non-storage CRT to be able to do this. The same type of CRT was also used in the 7104.


=== Year introduced ===
Years in which the various models were introduced according to the Tektronix catalogs:

1982: 2213, 2215, 2335, 2336, 2337 (first models)
1983: (no new models)
1984: 2235, 2236, 2445, 2465
1985: 2213A, 2215A, 2235L, 2236/01, 2465CTS, 2465DMS, 2465DVS
1986: 2220, 2230, 2430
1987: 2225, 2245, 2246, 2430M, 2445A, 2455A, 2465A, 2465A-CT and -DM and -DV, 2467
1988: 2235/01, 2246/1Y, 2430A
1989: 2201, 2205, 2210, 2245A, 2246A, 2246/1Y, 2247A, 2402, 2432A, 2440, 2465B, 2445B, 2465BCT, 2465BDM, 2465BDV, 2467B
1990: 2211, 2232, 2235A, 2235A/01, 2235L, 2236A, 2431L
1991: 2221A, 2252, 2402A, 2439, 2467BHD
By 1994, a decline had started, no new 2000 models being listed after that. By 1996, only the 2430A, 2440, 2465B, and 2467B were being offered. Later, the TDS series completely replaced the 2000 series.
The 2247 and 2252 are very similar, but the 2252 has printing features and programmable setups. 
Oscilloscopes with cursors include the 2211, 2246, 2252, and all of the 2400 series (2445, 2465, 2467). Cursors allow measurements that are independent of the graticule. With a cursor-equipped scope, the user can accurately and quickly measure, as a minimum, voltage, time, and frequency of all or parts of the waveform. Accuracy varies, but even the most basic cursors give more accurate results than taking readings from the graticule. The TAS 465, an inexpensive analog 100 MHz scope, also has a cursor system. The 2445, 2465, and 2467 have an option called CTT, which links a highly accurate frequency counter with the cursor and readout system.
The storage scopes go even further with various systems of parameter extraction. Because the waveform is a slice of time, digitized and stored in the scope's memory, the scope can work on that one set of data. Very quickly, as many as twenty parameters, or attributes, of the signal can be derived and displayed on the screen. Scopes that can do parameter extraction may also be able to communicate to a computer over a general purpose interface bus (GPIB), and do more advanced math on the waveform. These include the 2430, 2432, and 2440 digital storage oscilloscopes.


== 2400 series ==

The Tektronix 2400 Series oscilloscopes were perhaps the most powerful instruments of their time, with the 2445, 2465, and 2467 being the top-end models, and the 2430 series of digitizing storage oscilloscopes providing digital storage. They combined high bandwidth and sampling rates with automation features and waveform processing capabilities. In 1991, four models were available: 2430A, 2431L, 2432A, and 2440. Together with the 2402 and a PC, they constituted a complete waveform processing and analysis system.


=== Models ===
2430A: sampling rate 100 MS/sec, bandwidth 150 MHz
2431L: sampling rate 250 MS/sec, bandwidth 300 MHz (no delay sweep, no glitch capture, limited AUTO SETUP)
2432A: sampling rate 250 MS/sec, bandwidth 300 MHz
2439: sampling rate 500 MS/sec, bandwidth 300 MHz (no delay sweep, no glitch capture, limited AUTO SETUP)

=== TekMate 2402 and 2402A ===
The 2402 TekMate instrument extension was really an IBM clone computer that used the oscilloscope as both keyboard and monitor. The 2402 had two floppy drives; the 2402A could be had with a hard drive in place of the second floppy. The 2402 communicated with the scope over the GPIB bus, and would transfer waveform data, programs, and front panel setups in both directions. Waveforms could be stored on floppy disks, processed by software in the 2402, and reloaded into the scope for display. As many waveforms could be stored as one had disks to store them on.
The processor in the 2402 was an Ampro LittleBoard/PC motherboard running the NEC V40 CPU at 7.16 MHz. The motherboard in the 2402A was an Ampro LittleBoard/286 with a processor running at 16 MHz. They each came with about 1 MB of RAM.

Keyboard
A standard IBM PC/XT keyboard could be plugged into the 2402. The 2402A required a PC/AT keyboard. It does not appear to have been necessary, however. All functions could be executed from menus on the oscilloscope itself.

Monitor
The 2402 had a 9-pin female CGA connector, while the 2402A had an EGA card.


=== Probes ===
Supplied probe was the P6137, a highly sophisticated probe featuring 10X, 400 MHz bandwidth with readout capability and auto setup activation


=== Printers and plotters ===
HC100 Color Plotter.
The HC100 was a four-color plotter designed to make waveform plots directly from the Tektronix 2430-series oscilloscopes. It did not require an intervening controller. Under program control from the instrument attached to a GPIB cable, front panel commands could be used to plot digitally stored waveforms and printouts of instrument setup information. They are sometimes for sale, but do not always have the required GPIB interface.
HC200 Dot Matrix Printer. This unit could be used to produce waveform plots as well as capturing setup information. It could be attached directly to the scope with a printer cable, so a GPIB interface was not required.


== 7000 series ==

The 7000 series, a high-end modular oscilloscope family, was introduced in August 1969 and remained in production into the early 1990s. The series included a digital readout system designed by Barrie Gilbert that displayed plug-in settings directly on the CRT, using custom analog-ROM integrated circuits—the first such system in commercially available oscilloscopes. At launch, Tektronix controlled approximately 75% of the global oscilloscope market, and the 7000 series became ubiquitous in electronics laboratories throughout the 1970s and 1980s.


=== Mainframe models ===
The last digit of most model numbers indicated the number of plug-in slots the mainframe had. Initial models launched in August 1969 included the 7504 (90 MHz, 4 slots) and 7704 (150 MHz, 4 slots). The 7704 was notable as the first Tektronix laboratory oscilloscope to employ a switch-mode power supply.
Common single-beam oscilloscope models included the 7603 (100 MHz, 3 slots, $2,700 in 1983), 7704A (200-250 MHz, 4 slots, $4,260 in 1983), 7904 (500 MHz, 4 slots, $8,910 in 1983), 7904A (500 MHz IC-based redesign introduced in 1984), and 7104 (1 GHz, 4 slots, $20,160 in 1983). The 7104, introduced in 1978, used micro-channel plate CRT technology for high-brightness, single-shot event capture and represented the highest bandwidth analog oscilloscope ever built by Tektronix. The 7844 ($12,665 in 1983) was a dual-beam 400 MHz oscilloscope.
Storage oscilloscope models included the 7613 (100 MHz variable persistence with 60-minute view time, $5,025 in 1983), 7623 (100 MHz multimode storage), 7633 (100 MHz with >1000 cm/µs stored writing speed, $7,765 in 1983), 7834 (400 MHz, $11,705 in 1983), and 7934 (500 MHz transfer storage, introduced 1987). The 7834 won the IR-100 Award in 1977 as one of the year's top 100 technical innovations. The 7934 was the fastest analog storage oscilloscope ever built by any manufacturer.
The series also overlapped into digital oscilloscope territory. The 7854 waveform processing oscilloscope ($13,750 in 1983), introduced in 1980, was the first microprocessor-based oscilloscope by any manufacturer, using a Texas Instruments TMS9900 16-bit processor. It could function as both an analog and digital oscilloscope, with GPIB interface, and store up to 40 waveforms. The 7612D programmable waveform digitizer ($26,400 in 1983) and the 7912AD programmable transient waveform digitizer ($24,800 in 1983) were GPIB digitizers without displays.


=== Plug-ins ===
The 7000 series featured an extensive collection of interchangeable plug-ins using a standardized backplane interface. Plug-ins could be swapped between different 7000-series mainframes without recalibration.


==== Amplifier plug-ins (7Ann) ====
The 7A18A was a 75 MHz, 1 MΩ, 5 mV/div dual-trace amplifier ($1,180 in 1983). The 7A26 dual-trace amplifier (200 MHz, $1,910 in 1983) was the most successful 7000-series plug-in with over 120,000 units produced. The 7A29 ($2,530 in 1983) was a 1 GHz, 50-ohm single-channel amplifier designed for the 7104 oscilloscope.
Differential amplifiers included the 7A22 (1 MHz bandwidth with 10 µV/div sensitivity, $1,500 in 1983) and the 7A13 differential comparator (100 MHz, $2,865 in 1983). The 7A13 could subtract a DC voltage from the input and amplify around that voltage, enabling detailed examination of voltage rails—for example, subtracting a nominal 1.1V core voltage and setting the amplifier to 1 mV/div to observe power supply quality in detail.
Other amplifier plug-ins included the 7A19 (500 MHz single-channel, designed for the 7904) and the 7A16A (225 MHz single-channel with 1 MΩ input).


==== Time base plug-ins (7Bnn) ====
Time base plug-ins matched the mainframe's bandwidth capabilities. Two time base plug-ins could communicate to obtain a delayed sweep feature, such as the 7B80 and 7B85 ($1,335 and $1,605 in 1983). The 7B85, introduced in 1976, was the first timebase with "delta delay" (dual differential delay) and included a digital voltmeter to measure delay time differences. Some time base plug-ins included a delayed sweep in one module, such as the 7B53A ($1,430 in 1983) or 7B92A (500 MHz dual timebase, $3,175 in 1983).


==== Digital and meter plug-ins (7Dnn) ====
The 7D11 ($2,915 in 1983) was a digital delay, the 7D15 ($3,020 in 1983) was a 225 MHz counter/timer with eight measurement modes, the 7D13 ($1,105 in 1983) was a 3½-digit multimeter with galvanically isolated input, and the 7D12 ($2,815 in 1983 with M2 module) had sample-and-hold capability with an analog-to-digital converter accepting M1, M2, or M3 plug-in modules.
The 7D01 and 7D02 were logic analyzer plug-ins that used the mainframe as a display. The triple-wide 7D20 programmable digitizer with GPIB ($7,750 in 1983) turned an analog mainframe into a digital storage oscilloscope.


==== Sampling technology plug-ins ====
Many sampling plug-ins used S-series sampling and pulse generator heads compatible with earlier Tektronix 560-series sampling plug-ins. The 7S11 sampling unit ($1,780 in 1983) accepted one S-series head in a mainframe's vertical slot. The S-1 sampling head ($1,160 in 1983) provided 1 GHz bandwidth, while the S-4 sampling head ($2,665 in 1983) was a 12.4 GHz traveling-wave sampler with 25 ps rise time.
The 7S11 worked with the 7T11 ($4,460 in 1983) or 7T11A sampling sweep units as a time base. The 7T11 could trigger on 1 GHz signals or synchronize to 1-12.4 GHz inputs using tunnel diode circuits. The 7S12 TDR/Sampler ($3,390 in 1983) was a double-wide time domain reflectometry plug-in requiring both a sampling head (such as the S-6 30 ps rise time 11.5 GHz pass-through sampler, $2,295 in 1983) and pulse generator (such as the S-52 25 ps rise time tunnel diode generator, $1,655 in 1983). The 7S14 dual-trace delayed sweep sampler ($5,235 in 1983) was a complete 1 GHz sampler not requiring separate S-series heads.


==== Other plug-ins ====
The 7CT1N ($1,385 in 1983) was a curve tracer plug-in for testing small-signal transistors and FETs up to 0.5 watts. Spectrum analyzer plug-ins included the 7L5, 7L12, 7L13, 7L14, and 7L18. Combining a 7000-series storage oscilloscope mainframe with a non-storage spectrum analyzer plug-in (7L12, 7L13) allowed slow sweeps with displays that did not fade. The 7L5, 7L14, and 7L18 had internal digital storage and could show stable displays even in non-storage mainframes.


== GPIB bus ==

In 1965, Hewlett-Packard designed the Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus ( HP-IB ) to connect their line of programmable instruments to their computers. Because of its high transfer rate at the time (nominally 1 MB/s), this interface bus quickly gained popularity. It was later accepted as IEEE Standard 488–1975, and has evolved to ANSI/IEEE Standard 488.1-1987. Today, the name General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) is more widely used than HP-IB. ANSI/IEEE 488.2-1987 strengthened the original standard by defining precisely how controllers and instruments communicate. Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI) took the command structures defined in IEEE 488.2 and created a single, comprehensive programming command set that is used with any SCPI instrument. Many Tektronix instruments, including the 2430-series oscilloscopes, are available with GPIB interface cards.
