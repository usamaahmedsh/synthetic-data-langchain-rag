In October 2023, WK Kellogg Co (named after Will Keith Kellogg, one of the original founders of the Kellogg's company) was spun off from the Kellogg Company and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Kellogg Company was renamed Kellanova. WK Kellogg produced cereal products for the North American market, while Kellanova continued making products for other markets.
On July 10, 2025, it was announced that Ferrero would buy WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion. The deal closed on September 26, 2025.
