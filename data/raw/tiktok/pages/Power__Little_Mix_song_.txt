== Reception ==
The track was generally well received, with TimeOut magazine calling the song "brilliant", despite being "OTT" (over the top), but some fans did criticize the decision to feature a male rapper on a song about female empowerment. Attitude included the song #4 on their list of 32 greatest Little Mix singles of all time writing "Power has always a standout single on Glory Days. Although it seemed to invoke a marmite reaction from some fans when released, it is now become a fan favourite, especially with Little Mix's huge gay following."


== Music video ==
The music video was released on 9 June 2017 and was directed by Hannah Lux Davis, and filmed in Los Angeles. It features each member of Little Mix as the leader of their own faction of women. Jesy Nelson leads a group of leather-clad bikers, Leigh-Anne Pinnock leads a fashion-forward street crew, Perrie Edwards leads a group of hippies who were a big part of the 1960s-70s American feminist movement, and Jade Thirlwall leads a troupe of drag queens with representation of LGBTQA+ scenes. In the end, each faction comes together in a show of feminine power reminiscent of the Women's March.

Gabe Bergado for Teen Vogue wrote:"There's definitely a lot of empowering and political messages throughout the video — just the imagery of the march is reminiscent of the many protests and marches throughout the past couple of months championing gender equality and the rights of disenfranchised people. On top of that, people are literally holding up signs that say "LOVE" and "girl power" and one marcher with a rainbow flag.The music video, also features a cameo from famous drag queens Courtney Act, Alaska Thunderfuck and Willam, also known as The AAA Girls. Towards the end of the video it features a cameo from Little Mix's mothers, who appear at the end of the video to march with them. Stormzy's scenes, which were filmed separately from the rest of the video, feature him in a barbershop having his hair cut.
