Conan, the sword-and-sorcery character created by Robert E. Howard, is the protagonist of seven major comic series published by Dark Horse Comics. The first series, titled simply Conan, ran for 50 issues from 2004 to 2008; the second, titled Conan the Cimmerian, began publication in 2008 and lasted 25 issues until 2010; the third series, titled Conan: Road of Kings, started publishing in December 2010 and ended in January 2012 after 12 issues; a fourth series, titled Conan the Barbarian, continuing from Road of Kings, lasted 25 issues from February 2012 to March 2014; a fifth series, titled Conan the Avenger, started publishing in April 2014 and ended in April 2016 after 25 issues; a sixth and final series, titled Conan the Slayer lasted 12 issues from July 2016 to August 2017.
Another series, titled King Conan, which takes place during Conan's time as king, ran in parallel for 24 issues from February 2011 to March 2016. Dark Horse also published half a dozen one-shots and almost a dozen mini-series.
Dark Horse also published collections of the original Marvel Comics Conan the Barbarian, The Savage Sword of Conan [the Barbarian] and King Conan series in graphic novel format.
The publishing rights for Conan the Barbarian returned to Marvel Comics in 2018.


== Overview ==
Dark Horse Comics began their take on Conan in 2003 with a one-shot prologue, Conan #0: Conan the Legend.
The Conan, Conan the Cimmerian, Conan: Road of Kings, Conan the Barbarian, Conan the Avenger and Conan the Slayer series incorporate both new material and adaptations of stories by Robert E. Howard, with no other connection to Marvel Comics series or other post-Howard material. An ongoing dialogue between two characters, the Prince and the Wazir, living in an age centuries in Conan's future, is often used as a framing device for the stories.
Each issue also contains "The Adventures of Two-Gun Bob (True Stories from the Life of Robert E. Howard)" by Jim & Ruth Keegan.

== Conan ==
The six main Dark Horse Conan series, Conan, Conan the Cimmerian, Conan: Road of Kings, Conan the Barbarian, Conan the Avenger and Conan the Slayer make up a larger continuous storyline. This is indicated by numbering on the inner cover of these books with the text, "Number [#] in a series".


=== Conan ===
Conan was Dark Horse Comics' first series about Conan the Cimmerian. The comic's art consists of only color and pencilwork, with no inkwork, providing a painterly aesthetic. The series follows Dale Rippke's "Darkstorm" chronology.  The story "Helm" in Conan #18 addresses one of the major "faults" in that chronology.


==== Controversy ====

Starting at issue #24, Tony Harris became the cover artist.  One of the first pieces of art Harris submitted to Conan editor Scott Allie was a fully nude version of the cover of #24.  Allie inserted the artwork in a blurb at the back of Conan and the Demons of Khitai #3.  This displeased some comic store owners, and Conan and the Demons of Khitai #3 was reprinted with a censored cover in the blurb.  Even so, 4,000 copies of Conan #24 were printed with the nude cover, and distributed through the Diamond Dateline retail newsletter shrink-wrapped in black plastic.

Conan the Barbarian was Dark Horse Comics' fourth series about Conan. Brian Wood's run on the series was twenty-five issues and expanded on Robert E. Howard's original story "Queen of the Black Coast".
