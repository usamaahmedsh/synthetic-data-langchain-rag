The ninth season of American Ninja Warrior premiered on June 12, 2017 on NBC. Hosts Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila returned for their respective eighth and fifth seasons, alongside sideline reporter Kristine Leahy who returned for her third season. In addition prior to the ninth-season premiere, NBC aired a special ANW Celebrity, Red Nose Day edition featuring nine celebrities, each coached by nine elite ninjas on May 25 before airing USA vs. The World III on June 4.
This year for the first time, the top five women in each city qualifying course qualified for the city finals course, and the top two women in each city finals qualify for national finals, regardless of their placement overall. Beginning in Season 9, wildcard invitations will no longer be allowed for the National Finals in Vegas as only competitors who finish their city finals or those in the Top 15 (men) or Top 2 (women) by the end of the night will advance. Also, the show introduces ANW Obstacle Design Challenge, where from over 2500 fan-submitted obstacles, seven chosen obstacles are introduced in the show.

The National Finals were held along the Las Vegas Strip, as has been the case since the series set up its own finals course instead of sending competitors to Japan.


=== Stage 1 ===
All competitors must complete the eight obstacles on Stage 1 with a time limit of 2:35.00. Highlights from the first half included school teacher Allyssa Beird who made ANW history by becoming only the second woman (also the third worldwide, the first two being Chie Tanabe in Sasuke 2 and Jessie Graff in the eighth season of ANW) to complete Stage One, earning her the POM Wonderful "Run of the Night". Also, at only 5 feet tall, gymnastics coach Barclay Stockett became the second woman to get past the Warped Wall on Stage One. Later, NBC Sports announcer Mike Tirico joined ANW announcers Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbajabiamila for a few play-by-plays of the competitors. During the second half, "Real Life Ninja" Drew Drechsel earned the POM Wonderful "Run of the Night" with the fastest run on Stage One of the competition with a speedy time of 1:33.71. David Campbell's Stage 1 fail streak was over as he finished the course for the first time since Season 3. This season broke the previous record of most Stage 1 finishers with 41, beating the previous record of 38 from Season 7. Also, this was Kacy Catanzaro's final ANW appearance, as she failed on the Double Dipper. She signed with WWE in late August and the company's NXT brand in early 2018. She has since found success there, winning the NXT Women's Tag Team Championship and the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship with Kayden Carter in August 2022 and December 2023, respectively, and having the longest reign in the former championship's history at 186 days.
