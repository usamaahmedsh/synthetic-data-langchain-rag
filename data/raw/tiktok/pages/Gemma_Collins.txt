== Early life ==
Collins was born on 31 January 1981 at Oldchurch Hospital in Romford, East London. She is the daughter of Joan Collins (née Williams), who worked as a part-time hairdresser, and Alan Collins, the director of Unisystems Freight, an import-export shipping company. She has an older brother named Russell, who is also a director of their father's company. Shortly after her birth, the family moved from a house in Collier Row and Collins was raised in Rise Park where she attended Rise Park Infant School. Collins described her childhood as being "filled with love" and said that although money was "tight", her father still managed to take them on family holidays and said she has "very happy memories" of her early years.
Collins then went on to attend Frances Bardsley Academy for Girls. She enjoyed performing arts from a young age and attended dance lessons and stage school. At the age of 14, she began attending the Sylvia Young Theatre School and successfully auditioned for a part in The Sound of Music. Collins' mother was encouraging and said she knew that her daughter would one day become famous. Collins was bullied at school for being outgoing and confident, and so following the success of her father's business, her parents decided to move her to Raphael Independent School, a private school, for her final year of education. She left school at the age of 16 with a U in GCSE Maths. Reflecting on her time at school, Collins said "I remember sitting in the exam room for my maths GCSE and thinking, "I'm going to be famous, I don't need maths."
After leaving school, Collins got a Saturday job in the clothes shop Warehouse before becoming a waitress at a local pub called The Orange Tree. She signed up to a media studies course at South Essex College but stopped attending after a few weeks as she found it boring. Collins returned to her job at the clothes shop Benetton before spending a few weeks working in a care home, looking after people suffering from mental illnesses. Collins then worked at a recruitment agency in London before becoming a receptionist in a BMW showroom, where she retrained to become a sales executive.

In 2011, Julie Childs, mother of Collins' friend Amy, suggested to producers of the ITV2 reality series The Only Way Is Essex that Collins, who was a used car sales woman at the time, would be an appropriate subject. They went to Collins' house and then filmed her and her friends for two weeks. After going back to work selling cars for a week, she was cast in the programme and began appearing in The Only Way Is Essex from its second series in 2011; her first ever scene was selling a car to Kirk Norcross.

The pilot episode premiered to a total of 673,038 viewers, and was the most watched episode on ITVBe in that week. Diva Forever was subsequently renewed by ITV for a second series, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production was suspended.

She did not win the episode, however judge Gregg Wallace described her mushroom, chestnut and brandy sauce as "magnificent".


=== 2022–present: Self-Harm & Me, The GC's Big Night Out and Chicago ===

In February 2022, Collins fronted a documentary on Channel 4 titled Gemma Collins: Self-Harm & Me. The documentary followed Collins as she opened up for the first time about her personal relationship with self-harm and saw her speak to experts as they investigated what was behind the rise in cases of self-harm in the United Kingdom. It received positive reviews and Collins was credited for raising the subject of self-harm and for showing audiences a different side to her. It was subsequently nominated within the Authored Documentary category at the 27th National Television Awards. Collins said she was "blown away" by the nomination, reflecting that "it was the scariest thing to be so honest with [herself], however the response [she] got from the show was totally overwhelming.
In April 2022, Collins embarked on her first live theatre tour, titled The GC's Big Night Out. Performing in venues across the UK, the seven-date tour was announced on 19 April 2021 and tickets went on sale on 23 April. The tour was originally scheduled to take place between 15–24 October 2021 but was postponed due to logistical issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour began in Manchester on 5 April 2022 and Collins was joined by Stephen Bailey who assumed the role of presenter.

She performed in Glasgow, Southampton, London, Birmingham and Cardiff before the tour concluded in Newcastle on 14 April.
In May 2022, Collins was set to take over the role of Matron "Mama" Morton in the UK tour of the musical Chicago. Following the announcement of her casting in March, producer David Ian said "[They] were completely stunned by [Collins'] audition for the role" describing her as "an undeniable force both on and off stage" and that "audiences across the country [were] in for a treat." Collins received criticism from several actors and theatre fans on social media who described her as a "stunt casting". Responding to critics, Collins said she "auditioned for the role and trained really hard" adding that she "didn't just get it because of [her alter ego] the GC". She was scheduled to make her debut in the musical at the Sunderland Empire Theatre on 31 May and was due to perform in Cardiff, Blackpool, Sheffield, Norwich and Oxford on selected dates throughout June and July. However a week before, it was announced that Collins had been forced to withdraw from the production due to a flare up of her knee injury that she sustained whilst competing on Dancing on Ice. She was replaced by singer and Loose Women panellist Brenda Edwards.
In June 2022, Collins appeared in an online segment for the BBC nature series Springwatch. She visited Wild Ken Hill in Norfolk and was accompanied by Chris Packham and Hannah Stitfall, where she discussed her love of plants and wildlife and was advised on how to improve her garden before being given a tour around the site. Collins said she was "honoured" to appear on the show and that she had been overwhelmed by the "beauty of nature". In August 2022, Collins appeared on The Big Breakfast, in a guest segment that featured her assuming the role of an agony aunt and answering viewers' questions. In September, Collins appeared as a guest on the show and was interviewed by Judi Love in the bedroom about her self-confidence, upcoming nuptials as well as dispelling rumours she was set to present the next series of Love Island following an online campaign.

=== Alter ego ===
During her time on The Only Way Is Essex, Collins earned a reputation for being a diva. Her alter-ego was first created during the show's third series when Sam Faiers referred to her as "The GC". Collins describes her alter-ego as an "intervention" and says she and The GC are "very different people". Speaking in 2020, she said "Although I'm Gemma Collins, I've got my brand the GC. Gemma Collins is a homely girl who loves watering hanging baskets.
The GC, which is my brand, is basically a character that's over the top that people either love her or hate her, but on the back of her I've managed to launch perfumes and lipsticks." Collins embraces the term "diva" and says the word "empowers her". Her influences include Marilyn Monroe, Madonna, Beyoncé, Mariah Carey and Dolly Parton.


=== Humanitarian work ===
Collins is a supporter of animal rights. She has appeared in numerous campaigns for the animal rights organisation PETA. In 2013, she posed naked for the "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" campaign.

Addressing the prime minister Boris Johnson, Collins said "Take it from an icon, Boris – no one needs fur in their wardrobe. Do the right thing – ban fur imports and sales. Let's wear our skin and let the animals keep theirs." Speaking on her podcast, Collins expressed her interest in becoming a humanitarian and said she wishes to promote conservation and animal welfare to the next generation.


=== Media presence ===
Collins has been a subject of press and tabloid attention since she first began appearing on The Only Way Is Essex in 2011. Her battle with her weight is something that has been widely documented throughout her career, however she has been consistently praised for her confidence, and has promoted body positivity and encouraged women to love themselves no matter what their size.
Collins has a large following on social media, having amassed over 2 million followers on Instagram and over 1 million on Twitter. Such is her popularity, she is often paid to promote products and businesses on her pages and can earn up to £75,000 in one day from social media posts. Collins has stated that she only endorses products that she believes in.
Collins is widely known for her diva meltdowns and recognisable catchphrases during her appearances on television and in the media, and as a result became the subject of numerous internet memes. She was branded the "meme queen" by the BBC whilst Peter Robinson of The Guardian described her as a "social media powerhouse who has literally made a meme out of mispronouncing the word meme".
Collins is a staple of "hun subculture". Her popularity within the LGBT community has seen her make various appearances at nightclubs and events including G-A-Y and Glitterbomb. She is the most frequently impersonated celebrity on the Snatch Game on RuPaul's Drag Race UK, having been portrayed by Cheryl Hole and Kitty Scott-Claus in the first and third series respectively.
Collins has gone viral on social media several times. On one such occasion in July 2017, she attended the ITV Summer Party wearing an outfit designed by Gerda Truubon. The orange ruched dress with gold chain detailing gained attention due to the distinctive large shoulder pads. Several memes and comparisons were made, with comedian Alan Carr later dressing up as Collins for Jonathan Ross' Halloween party. She also gained notoriety for her falls at the BBC Radio 1 Teen Awards and on Dancing on Ice, the former of which was included in the "Fall of Shame" segment on The Wendy Williams Show in America. In September 2020, Collins was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by online pranksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners. In a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Institute, they cited Collins falling through the stage as an "act of unification" for the nation, and claimed that the "GC effect" could bring peace to North Korea. Following the successful nomination, Collins said she was "surprised and overwhelmed", and although she "couldn't see why someone would want to nominate [her]", she added that she was "all about world peace […] love conquers all. Peace is everything".


== Personal life ==
Collins lives in Roxwell, Chelmsford in a barn conversion which she bought for £1.35 million in 2021. She has described the house as her "dream home" and has had multiple renovations including a swimming pool and a summer house. Collins enjoys gardening and has expressed her love of plants. Collins is passionate about animals and nature. She has several life-size animal sculptures inside her home and in her garden, including a horse with a disco ball and a giraffe lamp, as well as a wooden Asian mother elephant and its calf, the former of which she donated £22,000 to CoExistence, an environmental art campaign conceptualised by the Elephant Family.


=== Relationships ===
In 2012, Collins dated fellow The Only Way Is Essex cast member Charlie King. During their relationship, she had suspicions that King was gay. He later came out in 2014. Following their split, Collins began a relationship with mechanic, Rami Hawash - whom she had previously dated in 2011 - and the pair became engaged on 25 December 2013; however, the engagement was called off a few weeks later. In November 2014, Collins was assaulted by her then boyfriend, Alexander Moss, at her former home in Warley. Reflecting on the incident in 2017, she said her biggest regret was not pressing charges because she was "too scared to see it through”. Collins briefly dated James Argent in 2012, before reuniting with ex-boyfriend, Rami. The pair reconciled in December 2017 when Argent professed his love for Collins during The Only Way Is Essexmas and they were in an on-and-off relationship until July 2020. Argent struggled with cocaine addiction which resulted in the breakdown of their relationship. Collins said Argent's addiction made her feel "suicidal" and caused her to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result.
In July 2021, Collins confirmed she had rekindled her relationship with ex-fiancé, Rami Hawash, several months previously after she was spotted wearing her engagement ring in April. They reconnected again after meeting at a Madonna concert. During an interview with The Times in December 2021, Collins announced that the pair were engaged for the second time. She also discussed her plans to have a baby with Hawash as well as a television show to document the pregnancy and baby's birth. She is stepmother to Hawash's son.


=== Health ===

Collins began self-harming as a teenager and did so until her early thirties. The first time she engaged in self-harm was at the age of 13 when she picked up a knife and cut her hand in front of her parents. In 2004, Collins had an abortion when she was around three months pregnant after doctors told her that her baby would most likely be born intersex. Following this, the relationship with her boyfriend began to break down and Collins recalls an incident where she slashed her hand open with a kitchen knife to deal with the pain of "grieving for [her] baby and [her] relationship". She also suffered from anxiety attacks and began binge-eating. Collins suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome and in January 2012, she suffered a miscarriage and gave birth to a four and a half month old foetus on her landing the day before she attended the 17th National Television Awards. In July 2020, Collins suffered a third miscarriage, which she initially suspected to be a heavy period, after which she wrote an open letter to Meghan, Duchess of Sussex detailing her struggles with infertility and thanking her for her "bravery and honesty" for opening up about her own miscarriage. Collins previously admitted her fear about never becoming a mother but has said she "won't give up hope" and hopes to conceive naturally one day.
In 2015, Collins underwent surgery to have a designer vagina which cost £2,000. In 2020, she announced that she was planning to have a breast reduction. In 2021, Collins had her botox and fillers removed, stating that she "didn't look like herself" and wanted to instead opt for a more natural look.
During her appearance on Dancing on Ice in 2019, Collins lost over two stone and since then has continued to lose weight after adapting a more balanced diet and exercise regime. She regularly posts workout videos and has shared her fitness journey on social media.
