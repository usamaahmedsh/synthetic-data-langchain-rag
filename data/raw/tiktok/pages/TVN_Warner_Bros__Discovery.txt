TVN Warner Bros. Discovery (formerly known as TVN Grupa Discovery) is a Polish media company that is a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery International. The business includes the assets of the TVN Group, a media company acquired by Scripps Networks Interactive, which later got bought by Discovery, Inc.
Originally, with the merger of WarnerMedia with Discovery, Inc., and the restructuration of its international business, the company's Polish assets, instead of being under Warner Bros. Discovery EMEA control, were left under its own subsidiary under control of Kasia Kieli, who is also a president of TVN Group.


== History ==


=== Background ===
TVN Group, a Polish media company founded on 1995, was acquired by Scripps Networks Interactive in 2015; first a 52.7% majority stake on March, and the remaining stake owned by ITI Group and Canal+ Group on July.
In December 2016, Discovery, Inc. bought a 49% stake on Metro, a recently launched television channel by Agora. In August 2017, Discovery announced that it would buy the remaining 51% stock, gaining complete ownership over the channel.


=== Establishment ===
On 6 March 2018, Scripps was acquired by Discovery, which led to the latter to expand its Polish business. Since then, Discovery merged its localized global networks under TVN Group control.
In 2022, after Discovery completed its merger with WarnerMedia, Kasia Kieli was named president for the group operations in Poland (also being named CEO of TVN Group), noting that Warner Bros. Discovery EMEA had no oversight over operations in the country, making it a separate entity under Warner Bros. Discovery International.
On 7 July 2022, Edward Miszczak, programming director at TVN since its beginnings and member of the board of directors of the company announced its departure, with a transition period in which he will be the director of the newly created programming division at TVN Warner Bros. Discovery.
