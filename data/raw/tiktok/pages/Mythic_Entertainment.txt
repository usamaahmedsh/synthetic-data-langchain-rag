Mythic Entertainment (formerly BioWare Mythic, EA Mythic, Inc., and Interworld Productions) was an American video game developer based in Fairfax, Virginia that was most widely recognized for developing the 2001 massively multiplayer online role-playing game Dark Age of Camelot. Mythic was a prolific creator of multiplayer online games following its establishment in the mid-1990s.
On May 29, 2014, Electronic Arts announced it would be "closing the EA Mythic location in Fairfax", effectively winding down all the studio's operations. Despite the studio's closure, Dark Age of Camelot will continue to be supported by ex-Mythic staff under a new studio, Broadsword, which is also responsible for maintaining Ultima Online. As of 2025, the name remains a registered trademark of EA.


== History ==
Mythic originally evolved from two early Washington, DC (USA) area online game development companies. The first was Adventures Unlimited Software Inc. (AUSI), was founded in 1984 By Mark Jacobs when it launched Aradath, a commercial online role-playing video game which charged US$40 per month. AUSI later developed games for GEnie, creating an online version of Diplomacy with Eric Raymond in 1990, and Dragon's Gate in 1985, originally inspired by Aradath. Mark Jacobs was the president of AUSI and other developers there would later work for Mythic.
The other half of Mythic Entertainment was Interesting Systems, Inc., founded by Rob Denton, Matt Firor, Don Campbell, and Roger Shropshire in Fairfax, VA, in 1990. Prior to the founding of Mythic Entertainment, ISI had developed one multi-user BBS text-based role-playing game called Tempest, which was later renamed Darkness Falls. Darkness Falls would later provide the codebase for Dark Age of Camelot.
Mythic Entertainment was officially formed in 1995 when AUSI (Mark Jacobs) and ISI (Rob Denton) joined together. Its original name was Interworld Productions, and in November 1997 the name was changed to Mythic Entertainment. Mythic made numerous online games in the mid and late 1990s, ranging from online action first-person shooters to online RPGs. Some titles include Silent Death Online, Magestorm Millennium, Darkness Falls: The Crusade, ID4 Online, Spellbinder: The Nexus Conflict, and Splatterball.
In 2001, Mythic Entertainment released its first MMORPG, Dark Age of Camelot, the game for which Mythic is best known.
Electronic Arts purchased Mythic Entertainment and renamed the company EA Mythic on June 20, 2006. EA Mythic renamed themselves back to Mythic Entertainment on July 10, 2008. Mythic Entertainment released Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, its second MMORPG, on September 18, 2008.
On June 24, 2009, it was announced that as part of EA's restructuring plan Mythic Entertainment and BioWare would come together under a new RPG/MMO division headed by BioWare General Manager Dr. Ray Muzyka. It was also revealed that the current General Manager and long-time Mythic boss Mark Jacobs had left EA on June 23, 2009 and would be replaced by Rob Denton. The company was then renamed to BioWare Mythic. On November 9, 2009, Mythic was part of a broader reduction in force throughout Electronic Arts. The number of employees released was not made public.
In 2012, the studio was renamed back to Mythic Entertainment. This was confirmed in November 2012 on the Dark Age of Camelot website.


=== Mythic / Microsoft lawsuit ===
Mythic sued Microsoft in December 2003 for trademark infringement and unfair competition regarding the name of Microsoft's Mythica MMORPG, which was in development at that time. On May 25, 2004, three months after the game was cancelled, Mythic announced that the case was settled and that Microsoft agreed to not use the Mythica name on new online video games and to not register it as a trademark. Also, as part of the deal, Microsoft gave all Mythica-related trademarks and domain names to Mythic.
