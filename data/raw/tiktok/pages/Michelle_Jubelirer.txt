=== Early career (1999-2012) ===
Jubelirer began her  career in 1999 as a mergers and acquisitions attorney at the New York law firm Simpson, Thacher & Barlett. She joined Sony Music as an in-house attorney in 2003, before relocating to Los Angeles in 2005 to join entertainment law firm King, Holmes, Paterno & Berliner, becoming a partner there.

In December 2021, she was named chair and CEO, becoming the first female chief executive in Capitol's 80-plus-year history. When she took over leadership of CMG, the label was facing a falling market share, staff turnover, challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, and an unwieldy artist roster. Under her guidance, the label won a bidding war for Ice Spice, had a number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 with "Unholy" by Sam Smith, had a viral TikTok hit with Doechii's "What It Is (Block Boy)", and released the new Beatles single "Now and Then".
