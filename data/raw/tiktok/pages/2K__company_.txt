Originally based in New York City, 2K moved to Novato in 2007.

== History ==

On January 24, 2005, Take-Two Interactive acquired Visual Concepts, developer of NBA 2K, NHL 2K, and MLB 2K games that were marketed under the Sega Sports brand. Take-Two paid Sega US$24 million for Visual Concepts, its Kush Games subsidiary and the 2K series' intellectual property. On January 25, 2005, Take-Two established the 2K Publishing label including its 2K Games and 2K Sports sub-labels. In January 2006, some of 2K's New York City offices were damaged by a five-alarm fire. In June 2007, the company relocated to Novato, California, alongside Visual Concepts. A third sub-label, 2K Play, was established in September 2007 to focus on casual games. Later that year, Take-Two partnered with Nickelodeon to license games based on its shows. 2K Play  absorbed all assets of Take-Two's budget-range publisher Global Star Software, including Cat Daddy Games, Carnival Games and games based on Deal or No Deal. In January 2013, 2K obtained the rights to publish video games based on WWE.
Christoph Hartmann, former President of 2K announced his resignation in May 2017 after nearly two decades with Take-Two. David Ismailer, who previously served as 2K's chief operating officer (COO), was named 2K's new President. Phil Dixon, formerly of Betfair, joined 2K as COO in November 2017. In September 2018, 2K created 2K Foundations, a social impact program that builds community and youth engagement programs and spaces for underserved communities around the world.
