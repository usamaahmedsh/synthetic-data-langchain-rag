=== Background ===
During Rutter's childhood, his mother often played the original "Put Your Records On" while driving. He referred to the original as "one of the greatest pop songs of all time". He recorded "Put Your Records On" in the basement of his parents' home after experiencing a bout of depression brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Rutter said, "I couldn’t handle writing a depressing song...I started playing around with the idea of manifesting happiness instead of projecting my own sadness."
The cover gained traction after being used in a makeup video on TikTok by user Skiian, starting a trend on the platform.
