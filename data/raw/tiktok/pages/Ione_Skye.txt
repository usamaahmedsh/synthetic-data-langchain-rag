== Early life ==
Born in Hampstead, London, Skye is the daughter of folk singer-songwriter Donovan and model Enid Karl (née Stulberger). Her father is Scottish-born with some Irish ancestry and grew up in England. Her mother is an American who was raised in the Bronx, New York City, and is Jewish. Her second name comes from the Isle of Skye. She is the younger sister of Camp Freddy singer Donovan Leitch. Skye's parents were separated at the time of her birth, and she was raised by her mother, having little to no contact with her father.
Skye grew up primarily in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and also spent time in Connecticut. She attended Immaculate Heart High School and Hollywood High School in Los Angeles.


== Career ==
Skye made her film debut with a supporting role in River's Edge in 1986, followed by a role as the title character in The Rachel Papers (1989). She played Diane Court, a withdrawn high school valedictorian, in the 1989 film Say Anything..., the feature film debut of director Cameron Crowe; the film attained a cult following and lent Skye international recognition.
In 1992, she played Eleanor Grey on the short-lived television series Covington Cross, starred in Allison Anders's debut feature film Gas Food Lodging (which also featured Skye's brother Donovan Leitch), and had a supporting role in the Stephen La Rocque film Samantha. She subsequently had supporting roles as Elise in the comedy Wayne's World (1992) and the Mike Figgis-directed drama One Night Stand (1997).
She later appeared in the music video for the Harvey Danger song "Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo." In 2007, Skye had a small, well-received part in the David Fincher film Zodiac.
In a 2010 interview with mondo-video.com, Skye said she had not paid perfect attention to her career arc over the years, saying she "never struck when the iron was hot" when it came to going after big Hollywood roles in her 20s.
In 2013, she appeared in a supporting part in the independent horror film Haunt, with Jacki Weaver. In 2016, Skye directed the music video for the Against Me! single "333." The same year, she appeared in the short film Kitty, directed by Chloë Sevigny.


== Other ventures ==
Skye is a painter, and sells her own works. She also wrote the children's book My Yiddish Vacation, published by Henry Holt and Company in May 2014. Skye has cited comic book artist Daniel Clowes as an inspiration for her painting and writing.


== Personal life ==
Beginning when she was 16, Skye had a relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis who was 24 at the time. Skye was supposed to appear as the cover model on the band's fourth album, Mother's Milk, which was released in August 1989, but the label felt she looked "a little young" (she was 18) so they used a different model. In January 2025, Skye posted the unused photo to her Instagram page saying that "it made me feel a little insecure to shoot it then not have it being used." In Skye's 2025 memoir Say Everything, Skye claims that when she was 17 years old, Kiedis got her pregnant and he paid for her abortion. "I was taking care of myself now, making a choice that felt good and important for my future. I would not have a baby at 17, with someone who didn't want to be a dad, wouldn't commit to me and had anger issues. Not to mention the heroin." Skye said she was inspired to tell her life story due to social media critics that questioned her romance with Kiedis. "These girls on TikTok were saying things like, 'How could my mom let me be with Anthony?' And I sort of clapped back. Not in an aggressive way, but I was like, 'Well, my mom was really upset that I was with a rockstar like Anthony Kiedis.' And I don't know, I kind of started feeling like I was able to tell my side of the story, and I had a lot to tell."
In 1992, Skye married Adam Horovitz, a member of the Beastie Boys. They separated in 1995, got back together in 1996, and separated again later that year and divorced in 2000.
Skye then had a relationship with furniture designer David Netto. They had a daughter, Kate, born in December 2001. Skye's Hollywood home and Netto's New York City apartment were featured in the February 2003 issue of Vogue. The two were engaged, but eventually separated.
In 2008, Skye became engaged to Australian musician Ben Lee. On December 29, 2008, Skye and Lee married in a Hindu wedding ceremony in India. They have a daughter, Goldie Priya, born September 24, 2009.
In a 2015 interview, Skye discussed her struggle with addiction, including bouts with alcoholism and other drug use.
In her 2025 memoir Say Everything, Skye wrote that she discovered her bisexuality during her marriage to Adam Horovitz. This led to her embarking on affairs with women, including model Jenny Shimizu and singer-songwriter Alice Temple. She eventually slept with former co-stars John Cusack and Matthew Perry, years after working together on Say Anything and A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon respectively.
