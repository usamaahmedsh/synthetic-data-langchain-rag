In her first year of college as a communications major, Sassa dropped out to pursue styling as a way to peek into the world of entertainment.

Raised by traditional conservative Filipino parents, Sassa faced the same challenges as many other children grappling with their gender identity in a country that has yet to enact an anti-discrimination law.
