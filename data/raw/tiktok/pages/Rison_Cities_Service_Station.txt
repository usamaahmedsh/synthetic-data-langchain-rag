The Rison Cities Service Station is a historic automobile service station at Main and Magnolia Streets in Rison, Arkansas.  It is a distinctive modest brick English Revival structure built in 1938.  It has a cross-gable roof, in which there is a small oculus in each of the gables.  The front facade has large plate glass windows flanking a central doorway.  It was built and operated by the Arkansas Fuel and Oil Company, which operated it from 1938 to 1969 as a Cities Service station.  Since then it has been seen various commercial uses.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.
