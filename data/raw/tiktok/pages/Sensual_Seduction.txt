"Sensual Seduction", also known as "Sexual Eruption", is a song by American rapper Snoop Dogg. It was released on November 20, 2007 as the first single of his ninth studio album Ego Trippin', with the record label Geffen Records. The song was produced by Shawty Redd. Snoop Dogg sings the majority of the song using Auto-Tune. The video's style visually references the style of Roger Troutman, as part of its retro imagery.


== Writing and background ==
Snoop Dogg originally heard the single "Drifter", produced by Atlanta-based producer Fatboi, and was prepared to purchase the song. Snoop Dogg's cousin — So So Def affiliate rapper-producer Daz Dillinger — began to facilitate mediations between the two artists. Dillinger, in a good connection with Shawty Redd, organized an arrangement in which Shawty agreed to send Dillinger the rights, but also offered to make an exclusive track for Snoop with a similar sound to that of "Drifter". Daz also organized an audition meeting for the two while Snoop was touring Georgia. Shawty Redd was unable to attend the meeting, but later conversed about the beat with Snoop via telephone. He sent a demo instrumental to Los Angeles, and was ultimately surprised by the changes Snoop made to the track. Originally, Redd didn't intend to use the auto-tuned effect on the vocals. The tape was sent back, vocals included, and Shawty began to play it in his local club. The song was leaked in early October 2007. This song was released as downloadable content for the Rock Band series.
On the song Snoop Dogg notably used the Auto-Tune vocal effect for his singing. The rapper explained his Auto Tune usage in 2022, saying that he wanted to emulate the musical style of R&B singer T-Pain. T-Pain stated he appreciated Snoop's usage, although he told in a 2021 interview that "Sensual Seduction" made his feature appearances on hip hop artists' songs obsolete, because they realized they could've used the effect by themselves.
