On October 18, 2010, KFC restaurants in Canada began selling the fried version of the Double Down for a limited time. It was reported that on its launch date, a KFC in Victoria, British Columbia was sold out of the Double Down by as early as 2 p.m. In French Canada, it is known as "Coup Double", roughly translated as "Double Punch". The Double Down was discontinued in Canada on November 14, 2010, but on May 25, 2011, KFC announced it was returning at least temporarily. In 2012 the Double Down returned to Canada, again for a limited time. In August 2015, KFC Canada finally brought the Double Down back again after a three-year absence.

This version of the Double Down featured a Belgian waffle between two seasoned chicken fillets and used maple-flavored aioli.


==== United States ====
The KFC Double Down was initially test marketed in Omaha, Nebraska, and Providence, Rhode Island. KFC announced it in an April Fools' Day press release, and launched the item in the United States on April 12, 2010. It has been promoted via billboards and a  TV commercial that says it has "so much 100 percent premium chicken, we didn't have room for a bun."
Originally, during a limited time offer that was supposed to end on May 23, 2010, KFC announced on May 19, 2010, that the item would remain available indefinitely. The chain cited its popularity in overall sales, as well as videos of people eating the Double Down becoming a YouTube sensation. Stephen Colbert ate one on The Colbert Report, spurring the item's popularity even more. By the end of 2014, the Double Down was no longer on the KFC menu and has remained off to this date.
On March 1, 2023, it was announced through Twitter (presently X) that the Double Down would return for a limited time from March 6.

KFC Australia started selling the Double Down (renamed The Double) with the tagline "make time for mantime" on March 30, 2011, for a limited time only. The Double was successful in Australia, although it was criticized for being unhealthy. KFC Australia announced via their Facebook page that if they reached 500,000 likes, they would bring the Double back to Australian stores for a limited time period of two days. The page reached 500,000 likes on June 15, 2012, and KFC announced that the Double would go on sale on June 27 and 28. The Double reappeared on menus in December 2012, again for a limited time only.
From May 10, 2011, the Double Down was available in New Zealand for an initially limited period of five weeks. The Double Down was also brought back for one day only on March 31, 2012, exclusively in Dunedin to raise funds for the Otago Rugby Union which faced financial difficulties in early 2012. On July 24, 2012, KFC resumed sales of the Double Down in New Zealand.
On October 28, 2016, KFC Australia announced via Facebook that they would again sell the Double Down for a limited time of four weeks, as well as a new spinoff product called the Hawaiian Double (replacing bacon with pineapple), commencing November 1. This was in response to an online campaign launched by Australian Facebook page 'Yeah the Boys'.
In August 2020, KFC Australia quietly launched and sold another variant of the Double Down, named the Zinger Mozzarella Double, which included Zinger-coated mozzarella-filled patties, bacon, mayonnaise and mozzarella cheese. The product was released through a "secret menu" on KFC's mobile delivery app and instructions on how to purchase it were later publicly unveiled through a grassroots advertising campaign on TikTok. Over a year later, in September 2021, KFC Australia launched yet another variant of the Double Down via their mobile app, known as the Pizza Double, which includes pepperoni slices and pizza sauce. The Pizza Double was sold in both original and Zinger variants alongside the regular original and Zinger Doubles. It was sold through September 7 until October 4, 2021.


== Nutritional analysis ==
NPR compared its calorie count to that of McDonald's Premium Crispy Chicken Club Sandwich. Both the grilled and fried Double Down products have nearly a full day's worth of sodium according to the American Heart Association's guidelines. A Los Angeles Times reviewer pointed out that the grilled chicken Double Down has fewer calories and less fat than the fried chicken Double Down (460 versus 540 calories, and 23 g versus 32 g fat) but that the grilled chicken option has more sodium (1,430 mg versus 1,380). The L.A. Times article also noted that both Double Downs have fewer calories than Burger King's TenderCrisp chicken sandwich, which has 800 calories.


== Sales ==
From its April 12, 2010, US launch through early July, a KFC spokesperson reported that the chain had sold 10 million units for a total of about $50 million in revenue. An analyst said that figure accounts for 5% of KFC's sales in that time period, a figure insubstantial to KFC's financial bottom line.
In Canada, the Double Down became KFC's best-selling new menu item ever, selling over 350,000 units in less than 10 days. Despite sales in excess of one million units, KFC Canada discontinued the Double Down in 2010, reviving it again for a short period in 2011. In August 2015, KFC Canada brought back the Double Down for a small period of time. Sales in New Zealand were 600,000 units over its five-week promotional period. Grant Ellis, CFO of New Zealand KFC operator Restaurant Brands, said that despite these sales the Double Down "did cannibalise some of our better-margin products".
Following the launch of Zinger Double Down in Korea, the overall sales for KFC Korea increased by 20%.
