Konami Cross Media NY, Inc. is an American production company owned by Konami.
Cross Media was founded in November 1992 as 4Kids Productions, a subsidiary of 4Kids Entertainment (which later became 4Licensing Corporation). After 4Kids was dissolved on June 30, 2012, due to a continued lack of profitability, their production office would be acquired by Konami and renamed 4K Media later that year. On April 1, 2019, the company adapted its current name; reflecting its expansion to manage Konami brands outside of video games. In addition to the localization and license management of intellectual property (IP), Konami Cross Media NY produces and develops new businesses using Konami-owned IP.
Konami Cross Media NY is responsible for producing edited English-language adaptations of Japanese anime series, primarily of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise. In addition to  overseeing the licensing, sales, and distribution of Yu-Gi-Oh! in the United States, Cross Media also manages Konami's gaming properties (including Bomberman, Contra and Frogger; as well as Rebecca Bonbon, the girl's anime brand created by Yuko Shimuzu).
