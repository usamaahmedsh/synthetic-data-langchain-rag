Studio 8H is a 6,102-square-foot (566.9 m2) television studio located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, United States. The studio is a part of NBC Studios, the home of the NBC television network, located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

== Construction ==
Studio 8H was built in 1933, at the time of Rockefeller Center's construction. It was intended not only for orchestral performances but also for radio variety programs with large studio audiences. It became the home of Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1937. At the time of construction, Studio 8H was the world's largest radio studio, 132 by 78 feet (40 m × 24 m) with a height of three stories, which could house a full orchestra. The first ever performance of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings was performed from Studio 8H. It was converted for television use in 1950, primarily for the live broadcast of Kraft Television Theatre.
