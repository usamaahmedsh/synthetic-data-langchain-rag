== Critical reception ==
Levi Buchanan of IGN wrote about the 2006 version developed by Glu Mobile, that the game's cosmetic changes from the original were "fun", but he didn't see a concrete reason for choosing this version over the classic edition. George Roush from IGN commented that the game was good, despite the disappointing AI and die physics. Slide To Play thought the game was a "solid" adaption of the board game, and thought it was a "bargain" considering the low price tag. Gadget Review thought the game was a "waste of money". 148Apps disliked the auto-auction feature, though liked the game's customisability.
