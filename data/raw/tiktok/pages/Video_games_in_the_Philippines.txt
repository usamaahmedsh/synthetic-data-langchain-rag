Video gaming in the Philippines is an emerging industry and pastime that includes the production, sale, distribution, and playing of video games. People who enjoy this pastime in the Philippines typically do so on their smartphones or in internet cafes. While the Philippines is a minor player in the video game development industry, trends show that the population of people who play video games in the Philippines is very high compared to other countries and is expected to continue growing. 


== Demographics ==

The Philippines' video game player base is very populated in the Philippines, with reports in 2023 finding that approximately 95% of people who use the internet play video games. The devices used to access video games on the internet are mainly smartphones, ranking at the top with 98% of video game players followed by a large gap with the second most popular device, laptops or desktops, at 50% of video game players. These high percentages paired with the Philippines' population density led to the Philippines ranking 6th out of 49 countries studied in time spent playing video games in 2024.
This distribution of devices is likely due to the accessibility of mobile phones compared to PCs. Before smartphones became more widespread in the Philippines, internet cafes were the hub of gaming communities. With home internet not being very reliable or fast, having an average speed of 5.5 Mbps in the Philippines compared to South Korea's 28.6 Mbps, Filipinos used internet cafes to fulfill their technological needs such as video calling or gaming. However, in recent years due to smartphones having more features and being cheaper to produce, smartphones became the most common device for fulfilling tasks that require technology instead of computers. The video game industry has taken note of this trend in the Philippines, with the most popular games in the Philippines being mobile games.

=== 1981 ban on video games ===
On November 19, 1981, President Ferdinand Marcos banned video games in the country through a combination of Presidential Decree 519 and later Letter of Instruction No. 1176 s. 81 making the Philippines the first nation to ban video games. The decree was a response to complaints from parents and educators who alleged that games such as Space Invaders and Asteroids were detrimental to youth morals, viewing them as a "destructive social enemy" and existing "to the detriment of the public interest". Marcos also decreed the ban of pinball machines, slot machines, and other similar gaming devices. Filipinos were given two weeks to either destroy their video games and devices or surrender the materials to the police and army. Violators had to pay a fine amounting to about $600 and face 6 months to 1 year of prison. Playing video games in the country went underground. The ban was effectively lifted following the 1986 People Power Revolution.


=== Piracy ===
Unauthorized distribution of video games is a complex issue in the Philippines. Despite legislation against copyright violation, enforcement and cultural factors remain an obstacle in the country. Bootleg video games, along with warez, contribute to the underground economy of the country where video gaming is a popular form of entertainment among Filipino families. The inability of many Filipino families to afford video game software and hardware at legitimate prices leads them to turn to unlicensed goods. The Optical Media Board in cooperation with the police enforces intellectual rights law in the country. Due to the increased accessibility of the internet in the Philippines though smartphones, many Filipinos have found piracy resources more easily, with social media sites and apps such as TikTok, Viber, and Facebook being used to distribute links or files to others.
