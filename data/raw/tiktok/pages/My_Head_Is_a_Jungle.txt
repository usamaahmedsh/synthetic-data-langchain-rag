"My Head Is a Jungle" is a remixed version of Australian singer-songwriter Emma Louise's solo single "Jungle", credited to German producer Wankelmut and Emma Louise. It was released in 2 January 2013 through German label Poesie Musik, a sublabel of Get Physical Music. "My Head Is a Jungle" charted across Europe, having the most success in Italy and the United Kingdom, where it reached number 5.
A remix by MK not released on the original press received airplay in mid-2014, and is more popular by YouTube views than the original.
In January 2022, the song went viral on TikTok as part of the "My Head Is A Jungle" trend, almost 11 years since the release of the original version and 9 years since the Wankelmut remix was released.
