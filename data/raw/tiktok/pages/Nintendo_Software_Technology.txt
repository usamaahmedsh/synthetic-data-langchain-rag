Nintendo Software Technology Corporation, doing business as Nintendo Software Technology (NST), is an American video game developer. NST was created by Nintendo as a first-party developer to create games for the North American market, though their games have also been released worldwide. The company was founded by Minoru Arakawa, Claude Comair and Scott Tsumura in 1998 and is located inside of Nintendo of America's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. 
NST has developed many games for Nintendo consoles, including the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series, Wave Race: Blue Storm, and Metroid Prime Hunters.


== History ==
In 1988, Claude Comair founded DigiPen Corporation in Vancouver, British Columbia. Soon after, he partnered with Nintendo of America on a certification program in video game programming. This partnership would help establish the DigiPen Institute of Technology as a private institute in Redmond. Washington. In 1998, DigiPen and Scott Tsumura's Big Bang Software were merged to form Nintendo Software Technology, consisting mostly of DigiPen personnel. Tsumura served as president and Comair was named chairman. NST was headquartered on DigiPen’s campus until 2010.
NST's first game, Bionic Commando: Elite Forces, was released for the Game Boy Color in 2000 and was a sequel of Capcom's Bionic Commando. Its next game was a Game Boy Color port of action RPG Crystalis, followed by Ridge Racer 64 and Pokémon Puzzle League for the Nintendo 64. The company then developed the multiplayer mode for 2001's Mario Kart: Super Circuit on the Game Boy Advance 


=== Project H.A.M.M.E.R. ===
NST started developing Project H.A.M.M.E.R. for the Nintendo Wii in 2003, but several problems landed the project in 'development hell'. By 2005, about 75% of the game was complete before concerns about the game's quality emerged. A large amount of funding was spent on cut-scenes early in development, and so when the project started to fall behind, senior staff didn't want to end it because of the capital already spent. The American developers suggested that the problem was the gameplay, however, the Japanese managers believed the problem was the environments. 
The game debuted at E3 2006, but never progressed further. It was later retooled into a more casual title called Wii Crush. By 2009, Nintendo had fired the chief game designer and pulled funding on the title. Soon after, a large number of staff were made redundant.
