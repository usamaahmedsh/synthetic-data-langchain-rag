Opernloft is an alternative opera theatre in Hamburg, Germany, located at the Altona Harbor on the Elbe River.
Many of Opernloft's shows have been staged as modern interpretations. Their 2023 production of Hansel and Gretel interpreted the piece as two patients in a dementia care ward.


== History ==
Opernloft was founded in 2003. It has previously been situated in Wandsbek and at a former Axel Springer printing plant in Fuhlentwiete.
In 2018, the theatre moved into its current home, a former ferry terminal on the Elbe, in late 2018.
In October 2021, the group produced Die Entführung aus dem Serail as a series of one minute videos, which they released on TikTok over the course of three weeks.
