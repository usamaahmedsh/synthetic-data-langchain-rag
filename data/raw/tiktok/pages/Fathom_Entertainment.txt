== History ==
The company was spun out of National CineMedia in 2013 to focus on live performances that National CineMedia had started presenting; the parent company remained focused on producing advertising for movie theaters, which had been its original business. Fathom Events is owned by AC JV, LLC, a joint venture of AMC Theatres, Cinemark Theatres, and Regal Cinemas, the three largest cinema chains in the United States.
John Rubey was the first CEO of Fathom Events, having previously served as president of AEG-TV and Network LIVE.
In 2014, The Theatre Museum Awards honored Fathom Events with the Awards for Excellence in Theatre History Preservation.

In 2015, Fathom Events was named "Best Distributor in the Americas" and received eight box office awards by the Event Cinema Association (ECA).
Ray Nutt became CEO of Fathom Events in 2017, having previously served as senior vice president of business relations for Regal Entertainment Group, where he sat on the board of directors for Fathom. Prior to that, he grew business for Regal CineMedia and United Artists Theatres.
In November 2023, The Blind became the company's top-grossing movie, taking over $15.7 million at North American box offices. The film was later surpassed by the release of The Chosen Last Supper: Part 1 in April 2025, which grossed about $20.2 million dollars at North American box offices.  
In January 2025, the company rebranded to Fathom Entertainment.
