== Background and release ==
While working on the album, Dion commented: "I couldn't wait to go back into the recording studio. And, I loved the songs that people wrote for me on this album. Those songs became even closer to me because, the fact that I took two years off, they wrote songs for me that were even closer to my emotions. I had things to talk about. I had things to sing about. It was a fun adventure, no pressure, relaxed, smooth, powerful but controlled. I really had a wonderful time. And to see my friends again, it was great".
"I'm Alive" was commercially released on 5 August 2002, as the album's second single. For radio release, the song was re-worked by Humberto Gatica. His version was released on the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack as well as promotional and commercial CD singles.
Although in October 2008 the album version of "I'm Alive" was included on My Love: Essential Collection, the new remix by Laurent Wolf was released to promote it in France. In January 2009, further promotional remixes were made by Maurice Joshua for the US clubs.


== Composition ==

"I'm Alive" was written by Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson and produced by Lundin. They had worked with Dion before, writing her 1999 hit "That's the Way It Is". Additional production was handled by Ric Wake and Richie Jones. It is a midtempo song, where Dion declares she is alive, fulfilled as a mother, and in love.
The song is written in the key of E♭ major with a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute. Dion's vocals span from A♭3 to D5 in the song. At the two-and-three-quarter minute mark, the song modulates up a whole-step higher to the key of F Major.


== Critical reception ==
While reviewing the Stuart Little 2 soundtrack, William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that "Dion occupies the position taken by Trisha Yearwood on the soundtrack to Stuart Little in 1999, singing an upbeat rhythm number". Another editor, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the song uplifting and highlighted it; in his review for album he called the song a "hitworthy uptempo gem". ABC's RollerCoaster review was positive, commenting that "this is the type of music you play in the background when you're having a good laugh with friends or a nice tea with family. It's the kind of song you sing along to and slowly get wrapped in it". Chuck Taylor from Billboard said that "I'm Alive" demonstrates a stylistic "left turn, with its throbbing tribal rhythms and a loose, sky-grazing vocal from Dion". The "percolating" Humberto Gatica mix "adds juice" to the album version, while the uptempo Wake up mix, with assistance from Ric Wake and Richie Jones, is Dion's most "inspired and festive" remix to date, with Blondie's "Heart of Glass" woven into the beat to "splendid effect".
Neal Sky of Pop Dirt named it a "bubblegum-radio-song". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it one of "the album's standout tracks", naming it "an uplifting midtempo number". Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic said that Dion is "full of energy and blasting her way forward with confidence is the order of the day". He added that it "could almost be declared as her signature, biographical anthem, if it were not for all those mega hits of the 90s".
