== History ==


=== Illusion Softworks ===
Illusion Softworks was established in 1997 in Brno by Petr Vochozka and Jan Kudera. The company succeeded Vochozka's video game publisher, Vochozka Trading, through funding provided by Kudera's Cash Reform fund. The team initially comprised only five people, including Vochozka and Kudera. The team would expand to 40 people by the release of Mafia in 2002.
The studio provided assistance to Silver Wish Games for the production of Wings of War, Chameleon and Circus Empire.
In September 2007, several Illusions Softworks employees left the studio to found The Easy Company, which went on to produce MotorM4X (2008).


=== 2K Czech ===
On 8 January 2008, Take-Two Interactive announced that they acquired Illusion Softworks for an undisclosed sum. As a result of the acquisition, Illusion Softworks became part of Take-Two Interactive's 2K label and was renamed to 2K Czech. According to Take-Two Interactive's chief executive officer, Ben Feder, the agreement was made to expand the company's "strategic focus on owning high-value intellectual property". In July 2011, several employees that had left 2K Czech, along with former employees of Bohemia Interactive, founded Warhorse Studios, the studio behind 2018 video game Kingdom Come: Deliverance.
In September 2011, 40 employees were laid off from the company's Brno studio, with a few others made redundant at its Prague studio. Both studios previously housed a total of 200 employees, with around 25% of them being cut due to the layoffs. In November 2012, 2K Czech began hiring for a new, announced project; at the time, 2K Czech had 188 employees. There were reported creative differences between developers within 2K Czech, regarding the direction of the third installment of the Mafia series, which had started production between late 2010 and early 2011, with the project being rebooted around seven times between 2011 and 2013.


=== Succession by Hangar 13 ===
2K announced in January 2014 that 2K Czech's Prague office was to close, and that 10 employees (including the development of Mafia III) would be transferred to 2K's headquarters in Novato, California, with most other employees moved to 2K Czech's remaining Brno studio. Of an undisclosed number of employees that were laid off, some were later hired by Warhorse Studios. Mafia III's development was later shifted to 2K's new studio, Hangar 13, with 2K Czech receiving a supporting role. In 2017, the studio was merged into Hangar 13.
