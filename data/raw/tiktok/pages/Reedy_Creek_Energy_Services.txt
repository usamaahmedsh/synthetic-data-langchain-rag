Reedy Creek Energy Services (RCES) is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. It operates the  electric and other utility transmission and distribution systems of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (CFTOD) on behalf of the district which specifically covers Walt Disney World outside Orlando, Florida. Some power is produced by the district-owned power plant north of the Magic Kingdom with the remainder purchased from the public power grid. RCES also handles all public services and public works for the CFTOD including water, natural gas, roadway maintenance, waste and recycling, sewage and wastewater treatment. Officially the utility distribution systems are owned by the district entity itself and the district contracts with RCES to operate the systems.
