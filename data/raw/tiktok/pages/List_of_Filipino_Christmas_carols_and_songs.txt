This article lists Christmas carols and songs traditionally sung by Filipinos during the local Christmas season. Like much Filipino music, some of these songs trace their origins to the Spanish and American colonial periods, while others were composed as part of the OPM movement.


== Daigon ==
It is an old Ilonggo Christmas carol in Hiligaynon. Daigon is the Hiligaynon term for caroling. Ilonggos are fond of singing this song caroling from house to house. It is sometimes used as a piece for Christmas carol choral competitions.


== "Himig ng Pasko" ==
"Himig Pasko" or "Himig ng Pasko" is a Christmas carol written by Serapio Y. Ramos in the 1960s. The opening line has become a popular allusion as it describes the Amihan, or cool, northeasterly trade winds that prevail around December.


== "Namamasko" ==
"Namamasko" is part of a series known as Maligayang Pasko, and was originally an untitled song now commonly known by its incipit. Though more playful in tone as carolling is seen as a pastime reserved for children, its theme is similar to the English carol Here We Come A-wassailing/A-caroling.


== "Ang Pasko Ay Sumapit" ==
"Maligayang Pasko at Masaganang Bagong Taon" (English: Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year), popularly known as Ang Pasko ay Sumapit (English: Christmas is Coming), is a traditional Filipino Christmas song. It was originally composed by Vicente D. Rubi and Mariano Vestil in 1933 as Kasadya ning Táknaa (English: How Blissful is this Season). A version of the song in Tagalog was used by Josefino Cenizal as a film score for the film Ang Pugad ng Aguila ("Hawk's Nest") in 1938. National Artist Levi Celerio also wrote Tagalog lyrics to the song during the 1950s. The song is still sung today in various communities, especially in churches both in the Philippines and abroad (usually during the end of the Holy Mass).
Ang Pasko ay Sumapit is in public domain as an unprotected work. In his 2011 press statement, former Senator Manny Villar claimed that if the Christmas carol and Celerio's other songs were protected by copyright earlier, Celerio would have not died a pauper.


== "Pasko Na Naman" ==
"Pasko Na Naman" is a Filipino Christmas carol written by lyricist Levi Celerio and composer Felipe Padilla de León.


== "Kampana ng Simbahan" ==
"Kampana ng Simbahan" is Filipino Christmas song arranged by Ryan Cayabyab and sung by Leo Valdez in 1981, as part of Pamasko ng Mga Bituin album, released by Universal Records (as WEA Records at that time). The song became a TikTok trend in Christmas of 2023.
