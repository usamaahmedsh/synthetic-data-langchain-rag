Monetization was achieved through video sales and advertising.

=== Brightcove.tv ===
Brightcove.tv was a video website dedicated to promoting Brightcove content.  Every publisher who created a Brightcove account was assigned a channel, their own page on Brightcove.tv.
Publishers could customize their channel through the Brightcove Console.  Simple details like the channel's name, logo, and description could be updated in the user's profile.  The content of a channel was defined by changing the settings of individual titles, lineups, and players to allow distribution and promotion on Brightcove.tv.

The app allows 15,000 members of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences who vote on the Emmy awards to gain authenticated access to view NBC's programs. The App Cloud was terminated in early 2013.
