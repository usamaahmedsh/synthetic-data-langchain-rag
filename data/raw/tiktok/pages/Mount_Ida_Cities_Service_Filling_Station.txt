The Mount Ida Cities Service Filling Station is a historic automotive service station at 204 Whittington Street in Mount Ida, Arkansas.  It is a small five-sided frame structure, finished in brick covered with stucco, with a hip roof that extends to form a canopy over the service area, with supporting brick piers at the far corners.  Its front (under the canopy) has fixed four-pane windows flanking a center entrance.  Built in 1925 by Cities Service, it was used as a gas station until 1966, and has since housed a variety of small businesses. Its role as a gas station was briefly resurrected in the film White River Kid, which was shot here in 1998.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.
