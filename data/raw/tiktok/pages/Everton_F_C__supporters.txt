Everton Football Club is an English professional football club based in Liverpool that competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Supporters of the club are known as Evertonians or "Toffees". Everton take their name from the district of Everton in Liverpool where it was originally formed. Everton's nickname is the Toffees, or sometimes the Toffeemen. This comes from one of two toffee shops that were located in Everton village at the time the club was founded.


== Demographics ==
Everton has a large fan base by virtue of being an original founder member of The Football League and contesting more seasons in the top flight than any other club. For the first nine seasons in the football league, Everton had the highest average league attendances of any team in England. The club has recently averaged attendances of around 36,000 to 38,000 in league games at their home stadium Goodison Park, which has a capacity of 39,572, despite having some obstructed views and poor sight lines. A 2006–07 fan survey by the Premier League listed 15% of Everton fans as being unhappy with sight lines at Goodison Park, and only 19% described match views as "very good". For the 2009–10 season, Everton sold over 24,000 season tickets. For the 2016–17 season, this had been upped to 31,000. In the same season, around 7,000 Evertonians travelled to Lisbon for a match against Benfica. The highest ever season average attendance at Everton was in 1963 with 51,603, the best of any club in that particular season. The following season, the club was once again the best supported side in England.
The 2004–05 Premier League survey, which asked almost 1,400 Everton fans various questions, found that 30% of those fans lived in Liverpool. The 2007–08 survey found that Everton fans on average live 44 miles away from Goodison Park, three miles less than the average and a huge difference compared with fans of rivals Liverpool and Manchester United, who were on average 82 and 78 miles from their respective stadiums. Everton draws the vast majority of its support from Merseyside, Cheshire, Southern parts of Lancashire, Western enclaves of Greater Manchester and North Wales. Everton also has a notable number of supporters in countries such as Australia, Ireland, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States.
The 2003–04 survey found that 71% of Everton fans earn under £30,000 a year, the lowest average income in the league. The 2002–03 report found Everton had the highest number of season ticket holders from the two lowest social classifications with 16%. A study in August 2012 by property website Zoopla found that houses around Goodison Park were the cheapest of any Premier League club, averaging £66,000, almost £30,000 less than the entry above it.


=== Social media ===
In 2009, Everton became the first Premier League club to set up an official Facebook page. As of January 2025, the club has the following social media statistics:


== Rivalries ==
A 2003 survey by The Football Fans Census found that Liverpool are still Everton's main rivals. The Merseyside derby (the intra-city rivalry between the two teams) is commonly referred to as "the friendly derby" as it is common for families and households in the city to have both Everton and Liverpool fans. Whilst performances on the pitch are heated and passionate, the off-pitch behaviour of fans is largely amicable in comparison to other rivalries, and it is one of the few Premier League match-ups that does not require the enforcement of total fan segregation during the matches.


== Fan clubs ==
Everton have fan clubs located all over the world. The three largest clubs outside England are Emerald Everton Supporters Club in Ireland, ESCNI in Northern Ireland, and the Everton Supporters Club on the Isle of Man.
