Sasan Heydari Yafteh (Persian: ساسان حیدری یافته; born 11 November 1988), better known by his stage name, Sasy (Persian: ساسی), formerly known as Sasy Mankan (Persian: ساسی مانکن), is an Iranian rapper from Ahvaz. Reuters has described him as one of Iran's most famous underground singers. Sasy's hit song "Gentleman" has over 100 million plays on the Persian music station Radio Javan.


== Personal life ==
Sasy went to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and now he lives in the United States.


== Career and controversies ==
His work is usually known as "danceable" and "energetic" songs. As of 2023, several of his songs have become popular on TikTok for twerk challenges.


=== Meeting Mehdi Karroubi ===
Before the 2009 Iranian presidential election Sasy met with the candidate Mehdi Karroubi. Due to his activity without permission, this singer was noticed and followed controversies by some media (especially some websites against Karroubi). Some websites wrote articles in Karroubi's critique under the heading "Aftershocks of meeting Sasy". In response to these controversies, Ahmad Zeidabadi stated that the reason for his vote for Karroubi was to meet with Sasy. Some sources also reported that Sasy performed live for Karroubi.


=== Arrests ===
Sasy was arrested on April 27, 2010, while attending several house parties in Kish. Some sources attributed his arrest to his support for Mehdi Karroubi in the presidential election, and some to "dance in the Kish Bazaar". In this regard, "Gouya News" published a satirical article entitled "Sasy Mankan behind Evin Showcase".
One week after Sasy's arrest, the deputy police chief, Ahmadreza Radan, said of Sasy's arrest: "The police will include someone like this who is looking for so-called anomalies." However, in an interview with Rapfa, Sasy described his arrest as mere rumor.


=== Collaboration with Alexis Texas ===
In March 2021, the release of the music video for the song "Tehran Tokyo" by Sasy Mankan, starring porn star Alexis Texas, was met with much criticism. A group called his songs immoral for young audiences, and a fall into art and culture, the result of preventing real happiness in society and the lack of teaching Iranian music in schools. A group blamed the broadcaster's poor performance on music and its closed view.
Mohammad Sarshar, the administrator of Children channel of Islamic Republic of Iran broadcasting, also called for an international prosecution and the arrest of Sasy Mankan, according to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Iranian media have previously criticized him for using sexually explicit language in his songs. Iranian singer Amir Tataloo found this "interesting and funny".
