VIA also includes an UNshare® feature allowing admins to withdraw information at any time, with an encryption that corrupts the files (and any copies) sent or saved. In January 2014, Intralinks announced a new version of its Intralinks VIA product, Intralinks VIA Enterprise, which supports complete content lifecycle management for the extended enterprise. It also has Intralinks Dealspace.
