24/7 is an American reality television program that follows sportsmen, and sporting organizations, for a period of weeks in the lead-up to a major sporting event.  The program premiered with episodes featuring pairs of boxers as they prepare for their upcoming boxing match against one another.  More recently it has expanded to other sport rivalries as well with NASCAR and the rivalry leading up to the 2011 NHL Winter Classic. Each edition of the program is generally split up into three to four episodes, and is narrated by Liev Schreiber.
In September 2019, the program was resumed airing under the title of  24/7 College Football, focused on four college football teams.
