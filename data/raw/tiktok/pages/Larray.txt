On July 21, 2020, Nikita Dragun held a surprise birthday party for Merritt during the COVID-19 pandemic. The party included social media personalities such as James Charles, Charli D'Amelio, Dixie D'Amelio, and others. At the time of the party, California's COVID-19 cases had just surpassed New York's cases. There was an estimated 67 people in attendance, many of whom were seen without face masks despite local health recommendations. Photos and videos of the event appeared on social media sites such as Instagram. These posts drew criticism from the public, including other influencers like Elijah Daniel and Tyler Oakley. Merritt, and some of the other attendees, later apologized. Residents of the Hype House later tested negative for COVID-19.
