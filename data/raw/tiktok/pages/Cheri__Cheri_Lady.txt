== Capital Bra version ==

German rapper Capital Bra released a German-language version of the song with added rap verses in March 2019. The cover was released following Dieter Bohlen's comments in German media that he did not like modern rappers for flaunting their wealth, saying, "everybody raps about his Maybach but at the end of the day they ride their bicycle home to their two-room flat" and that in 35 years nobody will remember Capital Bra's songs. Although Capital Bra initially criticised Bohlen's comments, the two later appeared in a video together on Instagram announcing the release of the cover. The YouTube video for the song was viewed over 500,000 times on its day of release. The song went on to become Capital Bra's twelfth number-one song in Germany, making him tie the record for having the most number-one singles along with The Beatles.
