Wargaming Chicago-Baltimore (formerly Meyer/Glass Interactive, L.L.C., Day 1 Studios, LLC and Wargaming West Corporation) is an American game developer that operates in Chicago, Illinois and Hunt Valley, Maryland.


== History ==
They worked in tandem with developer FASA Interactive to create their first two games MechAssault, which Microsoft used to promote their Xbox Live service, and MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf. They worked with Monolith Productions to make the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 console ports of F.E.A.R..
In 2006, they signed a deal with LucasArts to develop the science fiction video game Fracture. It had mixed reviews from the gaming press. In 2010, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced that they would be developing the third instalment in the F.E.A.R. franchise entitled F.E.A.R. 3, first announced using the title F.3.A.R., which was later confirmed as just for advertising.  When their subsequent project with Konami was canceled, however, around 100 employees (the vast majority of the team working on that project) were laid off.  The remaining team members moved forward with development on the free-to-play mech game Reign of Thunder.
On January 29, 2013, it was announced that Wargaming, the creator of World of Tanks, acquired Day 1 Studios for $20 million and rebranded it Wargaming West. The acquisition included the rights to Reign of Thunder, with it since having been put aside, and subsequently canceled.
