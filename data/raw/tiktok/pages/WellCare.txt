WellCare began operations in 1985 in Tampa, Florida as a Medicaid provider for the State of Florida. In 1992, Kiran Patel, a cardiologist and entrepreneur, purchased the company.
In 2002, Patel sold it to a New York investment group led by George Soros and Todd Farha. That same year, Todd Farha joined the company as CEO.
In 2004, WellCare became a public company via an initial public offering. The company opened on New York Stock Exchange with a sale of 7.3 million shares, each share priced at $17.

=== 2007 Florida investigations ===
On October 24, 2007, law enforcement agents executed a search warrant on WellCare's headquarters in Tampa, Florida–based on a whistleblower complaint that provided evidence of WellCare inflating patients' treatment costs and not returning overpayments to the state. The complaint also named several employees who knew about the activities.
In 2011, the SEC filed criminal charges against four WellCare executives. In 2013, the executives, including former CEO Todd Farha, were found guilty of the charges, including healthcare fraud and making false statements to law enforcement.
