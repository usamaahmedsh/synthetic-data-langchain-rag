== History ==
At near end of 2017, Mattel and NetEase partnered to create a new development studio. Mattel163 CEO Amy Huang-Lee says:

It was a very good match for both companies. One wanted to get into digital entertainment, while the other wanted to get into markets outside of China. It took about a year. We started discussing everything in late 2016 and we spent most of 2017 working out the details. We started then working on Uno, which was our first game.
On October 12, 2019, Mattel163 released Phase 10: World Tour, a mobile card game in the likeness of UNO!.
In 2021, Mattel163 released the mobile version of Skip-Bo.
In 2025, Mattel163 released UNO Wonder on the App Store and Google Play.
