The moment I put on a crown, [this] is a political act. The moment I put on a princess backpack, I'm fighting against a system that oppresses me. And when I wear pink and go out on the street and get attention, I am fighting against a society that rejects me and denies me the right to enjoy my own life. Because I'm really in danger because I'm the way I am.
Iván González, in his graduation speech

In 2015, at age 15, Hudson made a video at the Josep Maria Llompart secondary school in Palma about audio-visual culture. Hudson created a song, within which she criticizes the Catholic Church and its beliefs regarding the LGBT community using foul language. The song, titled "Maricón," was posted on YouTube in October 2015. Hudson stated in interviews that, to produce the song, she was inspired by an experience visiting a church where she went to listen to The Song of the Sibyl; when entering the church, she described a negative reaction by parishioners with gazes.
As part of the school assignment, she received a grade of 9 out of 10 from her teacher, but the project was nonetheless reviewed by a faculty council. During the review, all the teachers reaffirmed their support for the project, except for the religion teacher, who decided to mobilize in protest against its publication. The teacher later complained in a blog post about what he described as Samantha's "insistent and repetitive" way of showcasing what he referred to as "effeminacy". He clashed with the rest of his colleagues, who insisted that the project was "simply impeccable." Finally, the teacher issued a public message to the broader Catholic community. The video would later be temporarily removed from YouTube.
The then-deputy for Citizens political party in the Parliament of the Balearic Islands, Olga Ballester, described the video as "blasphemous" and complained about the lack of action by the Balearic government. The conservative organization HazteOír, collected 48,000 signatures seeking for the teacher to be fired.
As a result of the video of "Maricón", Samantha was excommunicated by the bishop of Mallorca.
In 2024, Hudson was dropped as a spokesperson for Doritos due to Hudson's Twitter posts seeming to condone child abuse. She posted those tweets in 2014–2015, when she was between 14 and 15 years old. She responded to the controversy by saying that she was sorry and added "I didn't think that way and still don't think that way, at that age I thought making jokes about delicate topics made me cool."

In October 2022, she announced that she is asexual. Hudson politically aligns herself as an "anti-capitalist and Marxist." In a 2020 interview for Vice magazine, she defined herself as a "drag queen" and "transvestite on call 24 hours a day."
