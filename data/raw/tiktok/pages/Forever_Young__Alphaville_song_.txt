"Forever Young" is a song by German synth-pop band Alphaville, released as the third single from their debut album of the same name. The single was successful in Scandinavia and in the European German-speaking countries in the same year. While only a minor success in the United States upon its initial release, "Forever Young" gained widespread popularity on TikTok in 2024. As of November 2025, it has over 1.1 billion streams on Spotify.
The single has been covered by numerous artists. It also formed the basis of Jay-Z's song "Young Forever". "Forever Young" is written in the key of C major.
In a 2022 interview, Alphaville lead singer Marian Gold said that it is "a great privilege" to have "Forever Young", as well as "Big in Japan", in "their luggage" when touring, and that he is grateful to be able to perform these songs.

=== Original 1984 version ===


==== Background and video ====
Originally intended to be an upbeat dance song, producer Andreas Budde recommended paring the song down to a sparse synth-pop ballad. The band spent two days attempting to record the dance version, but were unsatisfied with the results. Budde then told them to strip away most of the tracks, leaving only the vocals and synth pads, and upon playing it back said, "This is the song."
Marian Gold originally wrote the third verse to evoke a "fascistic feeling" of the adoration of the crowd:

Can you imagine how we won the war?
Little fascist lady she loves you so
Following her leader, she's getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen

However, for the final recording, record executives pushed for a change, resulting in:

Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders we're getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen

Gold calls the replacement "turn our golden faces into the sun" the worst lyric in the song.
Not a native English speaker, Gold received pronunciation instruction from producer Colin Pearson.  The band had decided that the word "dance" in the first line should be pronounced /dɑːns/ in order for the song to sound British (specifically Southern English, the track uses the English pronunciation. Sometimes Gold would forget and sing the American pronunciation /dæns/.
Originally released by Alphaville as a single in 1984, "Forever Young" was available in both its original mix and in a dance version, entitled the "Special Dance Mix". Over the years, the band has released several remixes and demo versions of the song.
In the US, the song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 95 in the week of 23 March 1985, peaking at number 93 the following week, before dropping off the chart following a four-week run; it also peaked at number 32 on the Hot Dance/Disco Club Play chart on 30 March. When re-released in 1988, the song was more successful in the US, peaking at number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 in a total run of 14 weeks.

The song's music video, directed by Brian Ward, shows the band performing in one of the halls at Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water, England. A number of people from children to the elderly, dressed in ragged finery, awake to watch the band, then walk through a diamond-shaped glowing portal.


==== Reception ====
In 1987, the song topped yearly retrospective lists in San Francisco's KITS "Live 105" and New Jersey's WPST 94.5 radio stations, with Billboard calling it "the modern rock equivalent of 'Stairway to Heaven'". "Forever Young" was top on both lists, beating out songs like U2's "Pride (In the Name of Love)", New Order's "Blue Monday" and the Smiths' "How Soon Is Now?".
In 2004 the song was featured in the movie “Napoleon Dynamite.”
The song was used for the end credits of the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode "Underage Drinking: A National Concern".
In 2024, "Forever Young" gained wide popularity on the social media app TikTok, 40 years after the song's release. The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts in the United States, and stayed there for 10 weeks.
In the mid-2020s, the song gained widespread usage in YouTube shorts. Frequently used as a backdrop for AI-generated videos of celebrities and other famous people being de-aged as the videos travel backwards through their lives.
