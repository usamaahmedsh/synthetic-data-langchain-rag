== History ==
In October 2019, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Apple Inc. was launching its own production company, overseen by Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, to produce original television and film content for Apple TV+.
Beginning in 2023, Apple Studios decided to partner with major studios like Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures to theatrically release some of its films. They would also own the distribution rights to the films for digital purchase and home video (although said films have yet to be released on home video), but Apple retains SVOD rights to the films.
