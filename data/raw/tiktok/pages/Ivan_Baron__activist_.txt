Although he took part in the inauguration ceremony of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, throughout 2024 Baron voiced harsh criticism of the government, reporting that his administration was making access to the BPC more bureaucratic and difficult. In his words, Baron wrote:For people to be benefited, or to continue having the right, they practically need to be in situations of misery, because neither they nor their family members can work, and this violates dignity. (Ivan Baron, 2024)On a previous occasion, Baron had already harshly criticized President Lula for a statement he considered ableist and unnecessary, involving the fact that Lula had linked beauty to not using crutches or walkers.
