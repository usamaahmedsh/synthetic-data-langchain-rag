The Central Bank of Yemen (Arabic: البنك المركزي اليمني) is the central bank of Yemen. The Bank is engaged in developing policies to promote financial inclusion and is a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion.


== History ==
A Yemen Currency Board was in activity from 1964 to 1967. The Central Bank of North Yemen was established in 1971 and the Central Bank of South Yemen in 1972. When the northern and southern sectors of Yemen reunited on 22 May 1990, the Central Bank of Yemen (of the north) merged with the Bank of Yemen (of the south) under the original name of “Central Bank of Yemen”.
Due to the Yemeni Civil War, the bank is bifurcated between the Central Bank of Yemen in Aden (CBY-Aden) and the Central Bank of Yemen in Sanaa (CBY-Sanaa).
