Mehak Malik (born 11 March 1995) is a Pakistani transgender dancer, TikToker, and stage actor known for her Mujra performances. Malik has gained significant popularity through social media and live stage shows in Punjab. She performs primarily in cities like Multan and has amassed millions of followers on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, where she shares dance videos, often set to Bollywood songs.
Malik's rise to fame highlights the visibility of transgender artists in Pakistan's entertainment scene. However, she has faced societal challenges related to her identity, including legal scrutiny over performances. She has also used her platform to discuss social issues, blending performances with messages on acceptance and community support.


== Early life ==
Mehak Malik was born as Kashan Rajpoot on 11 March 1995 in Kot Addu, Muzaffargarh District, Punjab, Pakistan. Although some sources cite her birthplace as Gojra, Toba Tek Singh District. Her family belongs to the Malik Kokar caste, with roots tracing back to migrants from Ludhiana District, Punjab, India, who settled in Pakistan following the 1947 Partition.
Raised in a conservative Muslim household, Malik has five brothers and one sister. From a young age, she showed interest in dance and performance, often mimicking songs by Pakistani singer Noor Jehan. However, her family initially disapproved of her inclinations, sending her to learn barbering instead. She left home to join a transgender community, adopting the name Mehak Malik and identifying as transgender.
She received formal dance training from transgender performer Sheen Jaan (also known as Shaheen Jaan), who became her mentor.


== Career ==
Malik began her career performing Mujra, a traditional form of semi-classical dance, at local weddings, parties, and small events in Punjab. Her breakthrough came in 2019 when a video of her dance at a wedding went viral on social media, drawing comparisons to Sapna Choudhary for her vibrant style and attire inspired by Bollywood numbers like "Dil Dene Ki Rut Aai" and "Tip Tip Barsa Paani."
She initially featured on the YouTube channel Shaheen Studio before launching her own, "The Real Mehak Malik," in 2019, which now has over 330,000 subscribers. On TikTok, she has over 2.8 million followers (as of 2023), making her one of Pakistan's most-followed creators, though her account was briefly banned in 2020 before reinstatement. Her Instagram (@mehakmalikofficial578) boasts over 160,000 followers, where she shares performance clips and personal updates.
As a stage actor, Malik performs across Punjab theaters. She has no known roles in TV serials or films, focusing instead on live Mujra and digital content. Her work has been covered in international media for challenging gender norms in South Asian entertainment.


== Public image and advocacy ==
Malik has appeared in several high-profile interviews, including discussions on Geo News' "Aik Din Geo Kay Saath" with host Suhail Warraich in 2025, where she addressed her journey, relationships, and societal perceptions of transgender performers. In a 2024 podcast on "RTS With Rehan Tariq" (24 Plus), she detailed her rise as a "dance icon" and advocated for transgender rights.
She uses her influence to speak on social issues, including acceptance of the transgender community and Islamic values. Despite online trolling, Malik maintains a positive public image.


== Personal life ==
Malik resides in Islamabad and enjoys traveling, shopping, and music. She is unmarried and has spoken openly about past relationships in interviews.
