Knob Creek is an American brand of Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey produced by Suntory Global Spirits (a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Osaka, Japan) at the Jim Beam distillery in Clermont, Kentucky.  It is one of the four Jim Beam small batch bourbon brands targeted for the high-end liquor market. Its siblings in the line are Booker's, Baker's, and Basil Hayden's.
The primary expression of the brand is aged for 9 years and bottled at 100 proof (higher than the typical 2 years and 80 proof that are the minimums required by U.S. Federal labeling requirements). Knob Creek comes in a rectangular bottle with a corked or twist-on cap and wax-sealed top. The bourbon has a dark, amber-brown color.


== History ==
The first Knob Creek bourbon was introduced in 1992, named after nearby Knob Creek Farm. It shares the same general formulation as Jim Beam, but is aged and packaged differently.
In 2009, Beam ran a campaign to publicize their shortage of Knob Creek bourbon. Demand exceeded the 2000 forecast, when the stock began the aging process.
Knob Creek was aged for nine years until late 2016, when Beam Suntory removed the age statement from the label due to tight inventory that could not be guaranteed to be aged the full nine years. In mid 2019 Beam Suntory announced the age statement would return to bottle labels sometime in 2020.
