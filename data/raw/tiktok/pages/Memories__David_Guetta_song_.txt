"Memories" is a song by French DJ and record producer David Guetta featuring American rapper Kid Cudi. Written alongside Frédéric Riesterer, who produced it with Guetta, it was released in February 2010 as the fourth single from his fourth studio album, One Love. The song became a top five hit in Guetta's native country of France as well as Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Australia, the Netherlands, Finland, Poland, New Zealand, and Ireland; it charted within the top ten in Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, and Denmark, with the song reaching a peak of 46 in Cudi's native of the US, where it also achieved platinum certification by the RIAA. The music video was filmed in Miami and directed by Keith Schofield.


== Critical reception ==
Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating: "Here he drafts in Kid 'Day N' Nite' Cudi to lay down the vocals over his trademark piano-backed beats. All the makings of a Guetta classic are present and correct, and Cudi's nonchalant, mellow vocals are pleasant enough, but it all feels that bit too familiar. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that 'Memories' adds nothing new to a sound that seemingly took over the world in '09 – not that anyone's going to grumble when it comes on at Oceana this Friday night, of course".


== Music video ==
The music video was filmed in Miami on 4 January 2010. It was directed by Keith Schofield. It shows Kid Cudi, wearing a Guns N' Roses T-shirt and a Cleveland Indians baseball hat, and David Guetta walking along Biscayne Boulevard, while the club scenes were filmed in Nocturnal. Fans were invited to be in the club scene. There is also a scene that takes place in a Franck Provost hair dressing salon, where a hairdresser is using a hair dryer on a hairless man, and another applies shaving foam in a circle on another client's head. It shows the camera crew to be nude models, who are seen reflecting in windows, metal objects and mirrors throughout the video with certain areas censored out. A super clean version of the video was released for use in public settings. Guetta wears a pair of Reebok Pumps in the video.


== 2021 remix ==
In 2021, Guetta released a new remix of the track. The remix was premiered during his New Year's live set from the French Louvre museum. It was also released as a reaction to the TikTok hype around the original track, which became popular during the lockdown due to COVID-19.
