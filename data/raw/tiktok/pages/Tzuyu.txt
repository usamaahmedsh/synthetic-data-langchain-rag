== Public image and influence ==


=== Public image ===
Tzuyu has received widespread attention for her beauty since her debut with Twice, and was nicknamed "Light of Taiwan" by the Taiwanese media due to her popularity. After performing at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2025, the bra that Tzuyu wore was reportedly sold out within a few days. According to Em Enriquez of the Filipino fashion magazine Preview, Tzuyu "singlehandedly" drove sales for the item, which has since earned the moniker of "the Tzuyu bra".


=== Influence ===
After the flag controversy in 2016, Tzuyu was credited with increasing Taiwanese votes by up to 1-2% in favor of President Tsai Ing-wen. According to Gallup Korea's annual music survey, Tzuyu was the third most popular idol among South Koreans in 2016. She ranked ninth in the 2017 survey and twelfth in 2018. In 2019, Tzuyu was ranked as the second most popular female K-pop idol in a survey of soldiers completing mandatory military service in South Korea. In 2023, Tzuyu surpassed Jay Chou and became the most followed Taiwanese celebrity on Instagram with over 10 million followers.


== Personal life ==
In 2016, she passed an exam at Tainan Municipal Fusing Junior High School to certify her middle school education. She attended high school at Hanlim Multi Art School in South Korea, and graduated in February 2019 along with bandmate Chaeyoung.
In 2024, Tzuyu announced that she had completed a master's degree in applied psychology from Miguel de Cervantes European University in Spain. She explained that she pursued the degree online for over a year, as Twice's group activities had slowed down during the COVID-19 pandemic. 


=== Flag controversy ===

In November 2015, Tzuyu appeared with bandmates Sana, Momo, and Mina on the Korean variety show My Little Television. She introduced herself as Taiwanese and held the flag of the Republic of China (Taiwan) alongside that of South Korea. Mainland Chinese internet users reacted angrily towards Tzuyu's actions due to the political rift between the two countries. Soon after, Twice was barred from Chinese television and Tzuyu was pulled out of her endorsement with Chinese communications company Huawei. Meanwhile, her agency, JYP Entertainment, released a video showing Tzuyu reading an apology, which sparked a furor among the Taiwanese public on election day. The incident gained international attention, as it was believed to have affected the 2016 Taiwanese general election.
