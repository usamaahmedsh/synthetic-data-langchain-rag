Woody Herman and his Third Herd recorded Kitchener's song in 1952 for Mars Records; Herman's band recorded it live that same year with the title "Jump in Line." Lord Invader released a cover of the song on the Folkways label in 1955, titled "Labor Day (Jump in the Line)". His rendition reached mento star Lord Flea, who in turn recorded a version based on Lord Invader's interpretation.  It was released on August 1, 1958, by Capitol Records.
The song was recorded by Lord Fly and Joseph Spence in 1958. Fly's version inspired Harry Belafonte, who released his own take on November 17, 1961 (credited to his pseudonym Raymond Bell on the disc label). It was included on the album Jump Up Calypso.
Perhaps its most memorable appearance is in the 1988 Tim Burton comedy horror film Beetlejuice, during the movie's end. This occurrence later appeared in the Broadway musical stage adaptation in 2019 as the finale. The song was later used in the first episode of the Adult Swim conspiracy theory/dramedy series Common Side Effects.
Belafonte's rendition of the song is featured in the 2010 dancing video game Just Dance 2.
A cover of the song by Karl Zéro & The Wailers was used in Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules.
Belafonte's rendition of the song went viral on video-sharing app TikTok in August 2019, without showing a significant increase in sales.
The song inspired the 1962 Gary U.S. Bonds hit single "Twist, Twist Senora".
Rock band Ash released a cover in April 2025.
