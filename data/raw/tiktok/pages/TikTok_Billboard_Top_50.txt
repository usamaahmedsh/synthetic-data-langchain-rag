The TikTok Billboard Top 50 was a music chart published weekly by Billboard in the United States. It ranked the most popular songs on the social media platform TikTok in the United States based on a combination of total creations, video views and user engagement on the platform. The chart premiered on September 14, 2023, with the song "SkeeYee" by American rapper Sexyy Red at number one. The longest-running number-one song on the chart was held by "Million Dollar Baby" by Tommy Richman, which stayed at the top for ten consecutive weeks. The chart was officially discontinued on March 7, 2025, lasting for only 18 months since its premiere as an official Billboard chart.


== Background ==
The video-sharing platform TikTok gained global popularity in the year 2019, and surpassed 2 billion mobile downloads worldwide in October 2020. TikTok has allowed many music artists to gain a wider audience, and has spawned several viral hit songs. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the platform has also launched many songs that failed to garner initial commercial success into sleeper hits. One of the first examples of this phenomenon is the song "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X, which started as a meme on TikTok, and became one of the biggest songs of 2019 and the longest-running number-one song in the history of the US Billboard Hot 100. A more recent example being 2023's "Paint the Town Red" by Doja Cat, which also topped the US Billboard Hot 100 after going viral on TikTok and became a worldwide hit. A study by MRC Data found in July 2021 that 67% of TikTok users are estimated to be more likely to look up songs on digital streaming platforms after hearing them on TikTok. While launching the chart, Billboard described TikTok as "the world’s most powerful platform for music discovery and promotion".
The chart was discontinued following the end of the TikTok and Billboard partnership on March 1, 2025. The final number-one song on the chart was "Not Like Us" by Kendrick Lamar.
