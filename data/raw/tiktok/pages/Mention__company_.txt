== History ==
In November 2011, inside the Hexa (formerly EFounders) start-up incubator in Paris, France, Arnaud Le Blanc wrote the first line of code for Mention. He worked alongside Edouard de la Joncquière to continue developing the tool until it was fully functioning. In 2012, Mention collected 1 billion mentions across the web and social networks, and Le Blanc and Joncquière officially co-founded it in 2013.


=== Investment ===
In January 2013, the company was officially established with 50,000 users, and raising $800,000 in flash seed funding from Alven Global Capital and Point Nine Capital.

In October 2014, Matthieu Vaxelaire, a former partner at eFounders, became the CEO of Mention. Under his leadership, Mention was able to expand its services to offer more than a freemium solution. Vaxelaire introduced Mention’s enterprise services with full account management, suitable for Small-Medium Enterprises (SME) teams. Later in 2014, Wired magazine named Mention one of the hottest European startups of the year. In 2016, Mention expanded to the US market and opened an office in New York City to cater to its growing North American customer base. Mention later introduced Publish, offering social media content creation and post scheduling.
