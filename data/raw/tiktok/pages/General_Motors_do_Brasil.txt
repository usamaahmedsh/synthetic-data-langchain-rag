== Criticism and controversy ==
In January 2019, after recording financial losses, General Motors Brazil presented a plan to restructure the company in Brazil. The Analysis & Opinion column of Jornal Já pointed this out as "blackmail", given the company's history: What the world's largest automobile company is doing in Brazil is a scandalous synthesis of the prevailing spirit at the top of large multinational companies. (...) Claiming financial losses in its Brazilian operations, GM threatened to leave the country. An ultimatum? No, blatant blackmail.
(...)
[I]t is hard to believe that the Brazilian market leader was not able to plan in advance for the slowdown in its activities over the next two years and, in the middle of the summer season, has to resort to a series of blackmail measures, many of them based on the labor reform of November 2017. It is an embarrassing situation for any executive. (...)

The most astonishing thing about this story is that, recently, during the government of José Ivo Sartori, from the PMDB (2015-2018), GM obtained tax advantages to invest R$1.5 billion in an expansion of production capacity that would be implemented in 2019. The whole thing will fall into the lap of the new governor Eduardo Leite, from the PSDB (2019-2022).
