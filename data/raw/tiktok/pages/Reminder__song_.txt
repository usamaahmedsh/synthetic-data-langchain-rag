The A$AP Rocky and Young Thug remix of the song featuring their new verses, was released on August 1, 2017, five days after its announcement, where singer the Weeknd posted two Instagram videos previewing both of their verses. Ryan Reed of Rolling Stone wrote, "A$AP Rocky’s winding verse touches on marijuana and Jaden Smith ('Just like Jaden Smith, I’ll probably walk around a day with it.') and referenced the Weeknd’s Abel Tesfaye ('No way you think if I ever decide to cut my hair like Abel') strolling around with his recently clipped dreadlocks at the 2017 Met Gala," and noted, "In his Auto-Tuned verse, Young Thug moves from referencing his humble beginnings ('I used to pray to hear my songs on the radio') to a series of financial and sexual boasts". It was later included on the deluxe version of the album, released on March 14, 2023.
