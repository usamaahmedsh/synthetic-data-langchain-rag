== History ==
On December 16, 1953, the first officer of the Costa Mesa Police department “hit the streets”
On March 10, 1987 a helicopter from the CMPD collided with another helicopter operated by the Newport Beach Police Department. The two crewmen in the CMPD aircraft were killed, while the other aircraft was able to land safely.
As a result of the Great Recession, the 2011 budget for Costa Mesa included cuts to the CMPD. Items cut included a police helicopter program characterized as a "luxury" by the mayor. Police chief Staveley resigned in protest, claiming that the budget crisis was a fiction created by City Hall for political purposes.
In January 2023, the department launched an internal investigation after a man uploaded a TikTok video that allegedly shows an officer using a racial slur during a traffic stop.
