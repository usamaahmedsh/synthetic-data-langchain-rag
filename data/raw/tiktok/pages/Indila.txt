== Early life ==
Adila Sedraïa was born on 26 June 1984, in Paris, France. Her mother was a caregiver, while her grandmother sang at weddings. She has two sisters. Indila describes herself as a "child of the world" of Algerian, Cambodian, Indian and Egyptian descent. Prior to her singing career, she worked as a tour guide at the Marché international de Rungis. She explained that her stage name comes from her immeasurable love for India.
In addition to her native French, Indila has provided vocals in English, including "Dreamin" with Youssoupha and "Bye Bye Sonyé" with DJ Abdel, and sung Urdu refrains in "Criminel" by TLF and "Thug mariage" by Rohff.


== Career ==
Indila's meeting with record producer Skalpovich allowed her to enter into the world of rap and eventually collaborations with several French rappers. Indila began her music career in around 2009, providing vocals for "Invitaation" by Vitaa, "Trinité" by L'Algérino, "Thug mariage" by Rohff, "Hiro" by Soprano, and composing "J'ai besoin d'y croire," sung by Admiral T and among others. "Hiro" was Indila's first successful collaboration, reaching number 26 in the charts in France and 27 in Belgium. She continued to collaborate with several other French rappers and DJs over the next three years, including "Poussière d'empire" with Nessbeal, "Criminel" with TLF, Press pause" with OGB, "Bye Bye Sonyé" with DJ Abdel, "Dreamin" with Youssoupha, which peaked in July 2012 at number 14 in France's SNEP charts, and "Ma Reine" with Axel Tony. Indila also composed the songs "Plus Haut" by Matt Pokora along with "Avec Toi" by Axel Tony featuring Tunisiano, in which she is credited by her real name "Adila Sedraïa". "Avec Toi", which was produced by Skalpovich, reached number 7 in the charts in France in November 2012.
In November 2013, Indila released her first single, "Dernière danse" (English: "Last Dance"), from the album Mini World, which quickly found success. It reached the top 10 of the French charts on 4 January 2014 and reached number 2 on 18 January 2014, where it remained through the week of 22 March 2014. The song remained in the top 200 in France through April 2015, for a total of 77 weeks in the top 200. It was also a success outside France, by the end of February 2014, "Dernière danse" was the number one song on iTunes in Greece and Romania, and the number two song on iTunes in Turkey. The music video for "Dernière danse", released 4 December 2013, reached 100 million views on YouTube 30 July 2014, and has over 1.1 billion views as of 7 December 2025, not least because of its popularity on TikTok.
In February 2014, Indila released her first album, Mini World, which was produced by Skalpovich. In addition to Mini World and "Dernière danse", two other singles from the album reached the top 20 in the charts in France: Tourner dans le vide (English: "Spinning in the Emptiness"), which reached number 13, and S.O.S, which reached number 8. Mini World was the best-selling album in France at the week of its debut and remained among the ten best-selling albums through the week of 11 October 2014. A limited-edition CD/DVD version of Mini World was released in November 2014, with two new songs, orchestral versions of "Tourner dans le vide" and "Love Story", an acoustic version of "S.O.S", and video of live performances of several tracks from the album. A second limited-edition release of Mini World in February 2015 contained ten tracks from the original release, the two new songs from the first limited edition, and another new song. Mini World found success both in France, where it was the third-best-selling album of 2014, and outside the country, where it was the best-seller of 2014 in Poland and second-best-seller of 2014 in Belgium.
In October 2014, Indila won the MTV Europe Music Award for Best French Artist. In February 2015, she won Best New Album of the Year award (for Mini World) at the 30th Victoires de la Musique. In 2015, Indila was among the ten artists to receive the European Border Breakers Award.
