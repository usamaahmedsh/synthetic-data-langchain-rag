Aurora Aksnes (born 15 June 1996), known mononymously as Aurora (stylized in all capital letters), is a Norwegian singer, songwriter and record producer. Born in Stavanger and raised in Høle and Os, she started writing songs and learning dance at age six. Her ethereal soundscapes brought her widespread acclaim, earning her the nickname "Fairy of Pop".
Aurora first gained recognition as a teenager in Norway, quickly emerging as one of the country's most notable pop acts. Her debut studio album, All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend (2016), received generally positive reviews, topping Norway's VG-lista for two consecutive weeks and earning a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). She followed with a two-part concept album: Infections of a Different Kind (Step 1) in 2018 and A Different Kind of Human (Step 2) in 2019. Her fourth studio album, The Gods We Can Touch (2022), marked her first top-ten entry in the UK and her second number-one album in Norway. Her fifth album, What Happened to the Heart? (2024), charted within the top ten in the UK, Germany, Norway, Scotland, and the Netherlands.
Known for blending electropop, folk, and art pop, she has been described as a pioneer of the Norwegian art pop scene. Initially trained on piano, Aurora gradually expanded her musical involvement to include percussion and production. Beyond her solo work, she has collaborated with a range of artists including The Chemical Brothers, Jacob Collier, Wu Qing-feng, Sondre Lerche, Tom Odell, Askjell, Bring Me the Horizon, and Hans Zimmer. Aurora has also contributed to soundtracks for numerous films, television series, and video game franchises, such as Frozen 2, Wolfwalkers, Netflix's live-action One Piece series, Kaiju No. 8, FIFA, Sky: Children of the Light, Assassin's Creed, and Genshin Impact.


== Life and career ==


=== 1996–2011: Early life ===

Aurora Aksnes was born on 15 June 1996 at Stavanger University Hospital in Stavanger, Norway, the youngest of three daughters to midwife May Britt Froastad and garage door salesman Jan Øystein Aksnes. Her eldest sister, Miranda, is a makeup artist and former teacher, while her other sister, Viktoria, is a fashion designer, stylist, and blogger. Aurora spent her early years in Høle, a small town where her parents had lived for 15 years, fostering her love for nature and traditional clothing, such as hats and long skirts, before the family relocated to Drange, a remote village in the woodlands of the Os mountains in Hordaland, near Bergen and Lysefjord. She described her childhood home in Drange as a quiet, car-free area with abundant trees and poor internet connectivity.
Growing up surrounded by nature, Aurora identified as a "forest person", enjoying activities like climbing trees, and valuing the isolation and safety of her environment. At school, her sisters worried she might face bullying due to her eccentric personality and distinctive style of dress, but she preferred solitary moments in forests, which she credited with helping her philosophise and discover her own mind. As a child, she was uncomfortable with physical affection and had an unusual hobby of collecting dead insects, such as moths, which became a symbol for her debut album. At age 11, she attended a funeral on Christmas Eve, an event that contributed to her developing dysphemia, prompting her to learn sign language. The loss of a friend from her sign language class in a car accident and two close friends—one to suicide and another in the 2011 Utøya massacre—deeply affected her, inspiring the song "Little Boy in the Grass", released in 2015.
One of her earliest musical memories is finding an electric piano in her parents' attic, previously owned by her sister Miranda. At age six, she began learning piano, initially imitating classical music before composing her own melodies by age nine, influenced by artists like Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Enya, and the Chemical Brothers.


=== 2012–2013: Career beginnings ===
Initially, Aurora kept her music private, as her parents did not encourage it as a career or hobby. She also explored other ambitions, including becoming a doctor, physicist, or dancer, and trained in dance from ages 6 to 16, performing in a contemporary dance group at the Norwegian Youth Festival of Art to songs like Paramore's "Decode" and Michael Jackson's "Ghosts". Her dislike of her own voice initially deterred her from considering a singing career.
Aurora's earliest known composition was "The Lonely Man", followed by "I Had a Dream", which addressed global challenges. Although she considered it a "really long and boring song about world peace", she performed it once at her high school's leaving ceremony. Before pursuing music, Aurora worked briefly washing the exterior of a pizza restaurant. Her breakthrough came unexpectedly when a classmate uploaded a recording of her song "Puppet"—originally a Christmas gift for her parents—and a video of her school performance of "I Had a Dream" to the internet without her permission, sparking her anger. The uploads quickly gained thousands of views in Norway, building her an early fan base on Facebook. In early 2013, a representative from Made Management, a Norwegian management company, discovered her work and invited her to their office. Though initially hesitant, Aurora was persuaded by her mother to consider sharing her music, recognising its potential to resonate with others.


=== 2014–2017: All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend ===
Following the success of her single "Puppet" in Norway, Aurora signed recording contracts with Petroleum, Decca, and Glassnote Records in 2014. That same year, she released two additional singles, "Awakening" and "Under Stars", with the former earning her the title of Untouched of the Week at NRK Urørt. Aurora's distinctive vocal style and musicality garnered critical acclaim across Europe and the United States, establishing her as a promising artist. In May 2015, she released her debut EP, Running with the Wolves, which received positive reviews from online music publications and Norwegian media. The EP's lead single, "Runaway", became a resurgent success in 2021 after going viral on TikTok through a trend, reaching number 22 on the Billboard Global 200 and number 25 on the UK Singles Chart. Later in 2015, her cover of Oasis' "Half the World Away" for the John Lewis Christmas advert reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. In December, she performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert, an experience she described as "an incredibly beautiful thing to be a part of." Host Jay Leno praised her performance.

In early 2016, Aurora won the Spellemann Award for Newcomer of the Year—along with a 250,000-kroner Gramo scholarship—and the EBBA Award for international breakthrough with her EP Running with the Wolves. That January, she was featured alongside Troye Sivan atop Rolling Stone's "10 New Artists You Need to Know" list. Her debut studio album, All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend, arrived in March and topped Norway's VG-lista for two consecutive weeks, marking her as the first Norwegian debutant to achieve a number-one debut since Emilie Nicolas in 2014. Weaving vivid lyrical themes of fantasy, heartache, life, and death—and drawing comparisons to Björk, Florence Welch, and Enya—the record earned a Spellemann nomination for Album of the Year while winning in the categories of Pop Soloist and Music Video of the Year ("I Went Too Far"). As of September 2018, it had sold 500,000 copies worldwide and was supported by a year-long international concert tour that began in North America and ended in Brazil.
That same year, Aurora contributed a cover of David Bowie's "Life on Mars" for the HBO series Girls. She made her American television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, performing "Conqueror"—a single previously featured on the FIFA 16 soundtrack and later included in the FIFA 23 World Cup update. She also appeared on The Howard Stern Show and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, performing "Life on Mars" and "I Went Too Far". Additionally, she partnered with YouTube for a creative content initiative and starred in the short documentary Nothing is Eternal, directed by Isaac Ravishankara and produced by The Fader.
In November 2017, Aurora performed a Christmas concert at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, during the Olavsfestdagene. The event sold out its tickets in five minutes and was broadcast on NRK1 the following month. Initially, the cathedral administration objected, stating the concert did not meet the venue's usage criteria, but an appeal to the parish council secured its approval.


=== 2017–2020: Two-part album and "Into the Unknown" ===

Following the release of All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend, Aurora announced in November 2016 that she had begun writing and producing her second studio album, describing her debut as the "first album of many." In 2017, she contributed a cover of "Scarborough Fair" for the Brazilian telenovela Deus Salve o Rei, also appearing in its opening sequence.
In April 2018, Aurora released "Queendom" as the lead single from her upcoming two-part album, followed by "Forgotten Love" in August. The album, recorded in France earlier that year with producers Askjell, Roy Kerr, and Tim Bran, saw Aurora deeply involved in the production process. The new material explored themes of politics, sexuality, and empowerment, inspired by interactions with fans during her debut tour, while maintaining some lyrical continuity with her first album. The music video for "Queendom", released in May 2018, emphasised inclusivity, particularly for her LGBTQ+ fanbase, featuring a scene where Aurora kissed a female dancer to symbolise acceptance of all forms of love. She previewed several new songs at festivals such as Lollapalooza and Coachella. The first part, Infections of a Different Kind (Step 1), an eight-track release, was released in September 2018, with Aurora describing its closing track as "the most important song I've ever written." The second part, A Different Kind of Human (Step 2), followed in June 2019. Aurora supported both releases with a headlining tour starting in Manchester in late 2018 and performances at festivals including Glastonbury, Groovin' the Moo, and Outside Lands.
In April 2019, Aurora co-wrote and provided vocals for three tracks—"Eve of Destruction", "Bango", and "The Universe Sent Me"—on No Geography, the ninth studio album by The Chemical Brothers. Later that year, she contributed backing vocals to "Into the Unknown" from Disney's Frozen 2 and performed it live at the 92nd Academy Awards in February 2020 with Idina Menzel and a chorus of international singers representing the song's translations. Her solo version of the song was released as a single in March 2020. Previously, in 2018, she performed a cover of "Baby Mine" as the final act at Disney's panel during CCXP for the soundtrack of Dumbo (2019).


=== 2020–2023: The Gods We Can Touch ===

In May 2020, Aurora released "Exist for Love", which was presented as her first love song, accompanied by a self-directed music video. Created during the COVID-19 lockdown with string arrangements by Isobel Waller-Bridge, the track marked the beginning of what Aurora described as "a new era" in her career. That year, she recorded the title track for the Norwegian Christmas miniseries Stjernestøv for NRK, under the musical direction of Gaute Tønder. She also contributed vocals to "Vinterens Gåte" and "Det Ev Ei Rosa Sprunge" for Herborg Kråkevik's album Juleroser, featuring the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, and re-recorded her 2015 single "Running with the Wolves" for the animated film Wolfwalkers.
Aurora's fourth studio album, The Gods We Can Touch, was released in January 2022 to critical acclaim, earning her first top-ten album on the UK Albums Chart and first number one on Norway's VG-lista since her debut studio album. It was preceded by the singles "Exist for Love", "Cure for Me", "Giving In to the Love", "Heathens", and "A Dangerous Thing". Following the album's release, Aurora premiered a virtual concert film, A Touch of the Divine, streamed via Moment House. She then embarked on a worldwide concert tour to promote the album, which included several music festivals, such as Rock Werchter in Belgium, the three South American editions of Lollapalooza—Argentina, Chile, and Brazil—and a closing headline set at Øya in Norway, which received rave reviews and led Variety and NRK P3 to name Aurora "one of Norway's biggest artists."
Throughout 2022, Aurora did a series of notable collaborations. She featured on Wu Qing-feng's single "Storm" from his EP L'Après-midi d'un faune and sang on Sondre Lerche's track "Alone in the Night" from his album Avatars of Love. She also released "Hunting Shadows" to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Assassin's Creed franchise. Her collaboration with Hans Zimmer included providing vocals for the soundtrack of the BBC's Frozen Planet II, and she performed "Take Me Back Home" at the Royal Albert Hall during the BBC's Earth Proms. That year, Aurora won the Spellemann Award for International Success of the Year for her contributions to Norwegian music exports and received the P3 Prize at the P3 Gull, presented by Billie Eilish.
Aurora collaborated with the video game Sky: Children of the Light, contributing vocals to its opening and closing themes. In October 2022, a collaborative event within the game was held, alongside a virtual concert that premiered after The Game Awards in December. It returned in August 2023 for an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for "Most Users in a Concert-themed Virtual World", which was achieved with 10,061 simultaneous players, and was held again in June 2025 as Aurora: Homecoming, celebrating Aurora's return to Norway post-tour.


=== 2023–present: What Happened to the Heart? ===

In January 2023, Aurora began teasing her fifth studio album, sharing on an Instagram story that she was "working on so many babies." That month, she collaborated with Tom Odell on the piano ballad "Butterflies". Between July and August, Aurora contributed a cover of Nick Drake's "Pink Moon" for Chrysalis Records' The Endless Coloured Ways: The Songs of Nick Drake and released "My Sails Are Set" for the soundtrack of the live-action series One Piece.
In October 2023, Aurora teased new music by posting an audio clip and pre-save link on her official Twitter account, captioned "08.11." The following month, she released "Your Blood", her first solo single in nearly two years, followed by the singles "The Conflict of the Mind" and "Some Type of Skin" in early 2024. During this period, she also completed a headlining tour in Norway. Aurora announced her fifth studio album, What Happened to the Heart?, in March 2024, with a release in June. The album fuses indie pop and disco, drawing inspirations from pop, techno, and folk music. It achieved top-ten chart positions in Germany, Norway, Scotland, the Netherlands and the UK, and won the Edvard Prize for Popular Music for being a "cohesive and well-thought-out work, carried by a clear artistic vision."
To promote What Happened to the Heart?, Aurora embarked on her fifth concert tour, What Happened to the Earth?, attracting approximately 300,000 attendees. Prior to her Wembley Arena concert, she hosted a free retrospective exhibition, Some Type of Skin – An Exhibition, displaying her stage outfits and visual art, tracing her aesthetic and career evolution. In 2025, Forbes included Aurora in its 30 Under 30 list, and Nordoff and Robbins honoured her with the Silver Clef Award for Contemporary Music. Later that year, she released "You Can't Run from Yourself" as the opening theme for the second season of the anime Kaiju No. 8. Alongside her solo work, she featured on Bring Me the Horizon's song "Limousine" from their album Post Human: Nex Gen (2024) and collaborated with Jacob Collier on a mashup of her song "The Seed" and his "A Rock Somewhere", performed in the Arctic to raise awareness for ocean and climate protection. She also contributed to the Genshin Impact soundtrack, performing the main theme of the "Nod-Krai" region alongside the London Voices and the London Symphony Orchestra.


== Artistry ==


=== Influences ===

At home, she did not have access to radio or music channels on television; she admitted that she had listened to very few artists at the beginning of her singing career. She has mentioned Ane Brun, Björk, Bob Dylan, Enya, Johnny Cash, Kate Bush, Leonard Cohen, Oasis, Susanne Sundfør, The Beatles, and Underworld as her major influences. She said that the first album she bought was Dylan's Blonde on Blonde. She also talked about heavy metal as a major inspiration for her from a young age, citing French band Gojira as her "favorite band", and she has attended two of their concerts. She first listened to one of their songs when she was around 11 years old and described it as "so hard and so intense and dark, and it felt like an explosion." Aurora has also listened to the bands Mastodon, System of a Down, Tool, Metallica, Refused, and Slayer. She also stated in a BBC Radio 2 interview that she had a great love for many Scandinavian heavy metal bands as well as David Bowie. Her love for heavy metal inspired her compilation EP For the Metal People, which included some of her songs influenced by the genre. Aurora also expressed her admiration for rock musician Iggy Pop, adding that when she met him during a festival in Belgium, she was "so happy I almost peed my pants." She and the frontman of Nordic folk band Wardruna have shown admiration for each other's work, and performed the song "Helvegen" together several times.
She has covered some of her influences' songs, some of them are "Mr. Tambourine Man", "Famous Blue Raincoat", "Life on Mars", "Across the Universe", and "Make You Feel My Love". About recent influences, Aurora stated that she dislikes listening to music, which she described as "noise" or "interference" for her, adding that she has "music in my mind all the time". She also said that she does not have streaming platforms like iTunes and Spotify but she has "some LPs at home and a few CDs." She added she only likes to listen to some of her influences' music during travelling.


=== Musical style and themes ===

Aurora's musical style encompasses a diverse range of genres, including art pop, Nordic folk, synth-pop, electropop, electro-folk, dark pop, avant-garde pop, alt-pop, folk-pop, and new-age. Critics have described her music in various terms: Haley Weiss of Interview characterizes her as a "poetic author of art-pop" and an "unaffectedly curious artist," while John Murphy of MusicOMH notes her songs blend "sizzling synth-pop" with Nordic folk influences. Michael Cragg of The Guardian identifies her sound as "dark electro-pop," and Cyclone Wehner from Music Feeds highlights her "darkly romantic electro-folk" and distinctive eccentricity, which have attracted a cult fanbase. Mathias Rosenzweig, writing for Paper, likens her to "Scandinavia's newest dark pop prodigy," drawing comparisons to Björk's fascination with natural landscapes and noting similarities to Sia and Lorde. Ed Potton of The Times compares her to Florence and the Machine, and Lisa Higgins of Clash describes her as an avant-garde pop artist, with Jessica Fynn from the same publication labeling her an "alt-pop aesthete." Chris Tinkham of Paste categorizes her music as "dark folk-pop."
Aurora possesses a soprano vocal range, with her voice frequently described as "ethereal" by critics. Her use of vocal motifs, such as "ah", "oh", and "la", is a recurring characteristic in her music. While she primarily composes in English, she has also performed songs in Norwegian, including "Stjernestøv", "Vinterens Gåte", and "Det Hev Ei Rosa Sprunge". Since her 2018 album Infections of a Different Kind (Step 1), Aurora has incorporated lyrics in an invented "emotional language" to enhance the emotional impact and meaning of her performances. She is proficient in playing the piano and has knowledge of other instruments, including the ukulele, guitar, and harp. Aurora occasionally contributes to the percussion and production aspects of her music.


== Public image and philanthropy ==

Aurora initially drew attention for her distinctive appearance, including a "childlike" look, pale skin without makeup, and short platinum blonde hair that matched the color of her eyebrows, in contrast to her vocal maturity and emotional depth of her music. She later adopted a partially shaved hairstyle described as "Norwegian Viking", and from 2018 to 2024, she became known for a layered haircut—long in the front and short in the back—similar to styles seen in anime. During the promotional period between her releases Infections of a Different Kind (Step 1) and A Different Kind of Human (Step 2), Aurora frequently performed with facial markings that symbolized "tears and smile wrinkles." Her onstage persona is often noted for its candid humor, shaped by her openness about intrusive thoughts, which she frequently shares with audiences during live performances.
Her wardrobe primarily consists of reused garments, many of which are designed by Aurora herself in collaboration with her sister Viktoria. A pescatarian, Aurora has emphasized the importance of conscious food choices as part of a broader environmentally aware lifestyle.
Aurora identifies as a feminist and advocates for a range of human rights causes, including racial equality and LGBTQ rights. She identifies as an introvert and neurodivergent, and in a 2018 interview with The Independent described herself as bisexual, while expressing a preference for embracing love and exploration without rigid labels. Aurora also showed support for various environmental awareness movements, topics that she explored in songs like "Apple Tree", "The Seed", and "Soulless Creatures" from her second and third albums. She expressed admiration for environmental initiatives by figures such as Greta Thunberg and the band Coldplay.
Aurora has been active in philanthropic and advocacy work. In October 2020, she performed her song "Warrior" for volunteers of the Clean Sounds Movement and called on fellow artists Billie Eilish and Sigrid to join the cause. She participated in a number of online music festivals, including Vi er Live (a demonstration against racism and in response to the murder of George Floyd), SOS Rainforest (in support of indigenous communities and rainforests in Africa, Asia, and South America), and the Exist For Love Sessions (to promote emerging artists). In November 2021, she headlined a non-profit charity event during COP26 to raise funds for Brian Eno's EarthPercent organization. She has also been politically vocal, particularly during the Gaza War, during which she called for a permanent ceasefire and joined the "No Music for Genocide" movement, geo-blocking her music on streaming platforms in Israel to protest the conflict.


== Impact and accolades ==

Aurora has risen to prominence as one of Norway's biggest contemporary artists. Media outlets such as Telegraph India, Veja, and G1 have dubbed her the "Fairy of Pop", while NME nailed her as a pioneer of Norwegian art-pop. Espen Borge of NRK P3 praises her as "one of the world's most successful creators," highlighting her songwriting skills and vocal expressiveness. Jem Aswad of Variety describes her as one of Norway's biggest acts and a veteran of the country's music scene. Catharina Cheung of Time Out, Aurora Henni Krogh of 730.no, and Øya Festival organisers recognised her as the country's biggest pop star in recent years. Tina Løvås of Musikknyheter.no went further, naming her "one of Norway's biggest artists of all time," also noting that her discography has left a mark on Norwegian music history.
In Aurora's hometown of Os, she was credited by former mayor Terje Søviknes (now mayor of Bjørnafjorden) as a leading artist in the "Os Wave" (the Os-equivalent of the Bergen Wave), inspiring and encouraging emergent artists. He remarked:

"If you have had the Bergen Wave, we have the Os Wave with Aurora at the forefront. [...] Aurora's success makes others dare to pursue her dream. We already have artists like Orbo and Eirik Søfteland. Aurora is leading the Os Wave forward and paving the way for the next generation."

Aurora has garnered praise from artists including Ane Brun, Billie Eilish, Doja Cat, Katy Perry, Oli Sykes, Shawn Mendes, SZA, and Troye Sivan. Billie Eilish credits "Runaway" as the inspiration for her decision to pursue a music career, while Björk's attendance at Aurora's KEXP session in Reykjavík led Dusty Henry to describe her a "big fucking deal."
She has also earned numerous accolades, including the P3 Prize at the P3 Gull for her significant impact on Norwegian music over time, four Spellemann Awards, with two nominations for Album of the Year, and an EBBA Award for international success with her debut EP, Running with the Wolves. At the age of 21, she became the youngest individual to receive a stone on the Bergen Walk of Fame. She was also named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in 2025 and had sold over one million albums worldwide by July 2021.
