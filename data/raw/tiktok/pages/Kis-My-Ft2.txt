In addition, fans who bought special CD sets that included the right to a high five were invited to exclusive high five events with the members over five days at three locations (Makuhari, Nagoya, and Osaka). As a result of these promotional efforts, the album sold 309,000 copies in its first week, marking the group’s highest-ever first-week sales, and topped the Oricon Weekly Albums Chart, becoming their 13th consecutive and 13th overall number-one album. Following the album release, they embarked on their arena tour, Kis-My-Ft2 Live Tour 2025 Magfact, which ran from June 21 to September 14.
As part of the group's live tour, a performance was held at Yokohama Arena on August 10, coinciding with the 14th anniversary of their debut. Portions of the show were livestreamed on YouTube. During the event, the anniversary was marked with a cake presentation, followed by the announcement that the new single "A Cha Cha Cha" would be released digitally on August 11. The song was then performed live for the first time, and its music video was released on the same day.
During the performance of "Otsukaresama Desu! feat. Sandwichman," the comedy duo Sandwichman joined the group on stage, dancing together and performing a short sketch comedy. The concert also included “Who's gonna play?,” a newly produced member-introduction song created after the departure of Hiromitsu Kitayama, with lyrical concepts developed using Artificial intelligence (AI). A special SD card for the official light stick, programmed to synchronize lighting effects with this song, was sold at the venue, enabling coordinated audience participation.
The show concluded with a fashion show–themed segment, in which the members wore elaborate costumes produced by Yuta Tamamori and used the moving stage and runway as a catwalk. They posed and performed model walks while singing “Cheat” from their latest album before exiting the stage.
On December 31, the group announced the release of their 33rd single, “&Joy.” Preceding the physical release, the song became available on various subscription-based streaming services on November 12, and its music video was released on YouTube the same day. Kis-My-Ft2 also performed “&Joy” on the music program Best Hits Kayosai on November 13, marking the song’s first performance on terrestrial television.

=== Michi Iijima, Manager in Charge ===


==== Focus on variety shows ====
In discussing their activities in variety shows, one must mention Michi Iijima, who was once the manager in charge  of Kis-My-Ft2 and SMAP. She is said to be the person who nurtured SMAP, an unpopular group when it debuted at Johnny & Associates, into a nationally popular group. In the past, idols were limited to appearing in music shows and dramas. She actively promoted SMAP members to appear on variety shows and perform with comedians to increase their name recognition among the general public, and succeeded in developing SMAP into a popular group. After Kis-My-Ft2 debuted, she became the manager in charge of the group and used the same method to make them focus on variety shows. In the beginning, members of Kis-My-Ft2 often appeared as guests on programs in which SMAP appeared. SMAP and Kis-My-Ft2, led by manager Iijima, were called the "Iijima team" by the mass media at the time, and were often compared to other groups such as Arashi, managed by vice president Julie Keiko Fujishima. The members of Kis-My-Ft2 gained experience in working with SMAP and in variety shows such as their show Hamakiss, which led to more TV appearances.
Iijima later had a falling out with Yasuko Mary Kitagawa, sister of Johnny & Associates president Johnny Kitagawa, and left the company in 2016, and SMAP disbanded that same year. Although the manager in charge changed and SMAP disbanded, the relationship between Kis-My-Ft2 and SMAP members, especially Masahiro Nakai, has continued since then. Members of Kis-My-Ft2 have continued to appear on TV shows hosted by Masahiro Nakai who is an active individual.


==== Disparity Era in Kis-My-Ft2 ====
Iijima is known as SMAP's astute manager, but her promotional strategies for Kis-My-Ft2 have been considered controversial. She actively promoted Yuta Tamamori, Taisuke Fujigaya, and Hiromitsu Kitayama—known as the "front three"—to raise awareness of the seven-member group. In music videos, the "front three" and the "back four" often wore different costumes, with the "back four" sometimes dressed in black outfits similar to those worn by backup dancers. The "back four" were not treated equally, and during music show appearances, they were often given simpler costumes and were occasionally made to perform behind junior trainees.
Compared to the "front three," who continued to land roles in television dramas, the "back four" had few individual opportunities. Noticing this disparity, Masahiro Nakai took an interest in the "back four" and produced a spin-off unit called Busaiku for them. Since Iijima's departure, the blatant difference in treatment has gradually faded,[234] but the members do not look back fondly on that period, referring to it as the "disparity era." The visual distinction between the "front three" and the "back four" persisted for several years and remained evident until the music video for their 20th single, Akai Kajitsu, released in November 2017.
Member Kento Senga later reflected on this period, recalling that during the promotion of their second single "We Never Give Up!", the "front three" wore elaborate white costumes with fur and sequins, while the "back four" were dressed in plain maroon shirts. He also noted that even the backup trainee performers wore bright red jackets, making the "back four" appear even more understated. Despite this, Senga shared that they made efforts to appear in the background of solo shots featuring the "front three".
Senga, Toshiya Miyata, and Takashi Nikaido also spoke about this era on the variety show, where they recalled the filming of the music video for their debut single, "Everybody Go". In the video's final scene, all members strike a boxing pose as the camera pans slowly to show each face in close-up. Although they expected this to be the moment where each member would be clearly featured, they said they were disappointed when they later saw the finished version, as the "back four" members' faces were barely visible due to strong backlighting and smoke effects. They added that music video shoots often lasted more than 24 hours, and that it had been difficult to stay motivated at the time when they had little on-screen presence.  They noted, however, that members are treated more equally in recent years, and that they can now look back on these experiences as a laughing matter.


=== Variety show on TV Asahi ===
Since their debut, they have appeared in many so-called physical variety shows, including Hama Kiss.
Hama Kiss is a TV Asahi late-night show in which members who have just debuted apprentice themselves to popular veteran comedian Masaru Hamaguchi and learn the ropes of variety shows. The show's selling point was its physical projects, and Kis-My-Ft2 members tried out one project after another, which was unlike those of idols. One example of a harsh project was a project where seven people had to eat 1,000 rice crackers. They were forbidden to eat anything other than crackers, which varied in size and hardness, and some of the crackers were so hot that they found it hard to keep eating, with some members starting fights, cutting the inside of their mouths and swelling their cheeks. Other projects included getting face close to a crocodile, eating insects and bungee jumping while filming. The programme began on 29 December 2011 on an irregular basis and became a regular programme on 4 April 2012. The show became so popular that the name of the programme was then changed, but the programme by Kis-My-Ft2 and Masaru Hamaguchi continued until September 2014. After that, Kis-My-Ft2 programme continued on TV Asahi. Since October 2017, the partners have been the comedy duo Sandwichman. The program included a project in which Kis-My-Ft2 members would buy 100,000-yen Lottery tickets and examine each one to see if it was a winner on the day of the event, sometimes winning a large sum. The program gained popularity and air in primetime from April 2019 as Can we do it for 100,000 yen?.


=== Kis-My-Busaiku!? ===
Their namesake variety show Kis-My-Busaiku!?, which program has been broadcast irregularly since 2012, began regular broadcasting on Fuji TV from April 2013. Busaiku means "ugly" or "not cool". When they debuted, a search for their group name showed the negative word "Busaiku" in the search engine's predictions. This is where the name of the programme came from. This was also unusual for an idol at the time. In this program, members of Kis-My-Ft2 come up with "words and gestures that women think are cool", perform them in various romantic situations, have women rate them, and rank them. The cool lines they came up with were sometimes harshly criticized or laughed at mercilessly by the women, and because this was a rare project for an idol variety show at the time, it became a popular program. The programme changed its airtime to late night in 2017, but continued until Hiromitsu Kitayama's departure in September 2023.
