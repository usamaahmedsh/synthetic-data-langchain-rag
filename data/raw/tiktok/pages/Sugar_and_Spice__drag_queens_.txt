Cooper Coyle and Luca Coyle, better known by their respective stage names Sugar Solay and Spice, are a twin sibling duo of American drag performers originally from Long Island, New York. They are best known for their presence on TikTok as well as being individual contestants on the fifteenth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.


== Early life ==
Cooper and Luca Coyle were born on July 19, 1998 in Long Island, New York. They were raised there with their older sister.


== Drag career ==
Sugar and Spice gained prominence on Vine as teenagers. On TikTok, the duo had more than 3.8 million followers by early 2021 and 7.4 million followers by 2023.
Sugar and Spice competed on the fifteenth season of RuPaul's Drag Race, which premiered in January 2023. They are the show's first sibling contestants. During the Snatch Game challenge, Sugar impersonated Trisha Paytas and Spice portrayed Miley Cyrus; they were both panned for their performances and were placed in the bottom two together. The duo performed a synchronized lip sync to Pat Benatar's "You Better Run", before Sugar was eliminated. Charlie Grey of Queerty wrote, "We knew the Sugar x Spice lipsync was destined to happen from the moment they were cast on the show together, and they did not disappoint. The pair put on a show complete with choreo, bits, and entirely too much fun — a perfect encapsulation of Sugar's run on this season." Out of 16 competitors, Sugar and Spice finished in 14th place and 9th place, respectively.
In November 2025, Sugar announced that she would be changing her stage name to Sugar Solay.


== Personal lives ==
Both Cooper and Luca are gay. The twins came out to their mother online. In 2022, they relocated from Long Island to the greater Los Angeles area.
