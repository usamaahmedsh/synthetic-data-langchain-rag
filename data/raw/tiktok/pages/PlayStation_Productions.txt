== History ==

Two PlayStation adaptations were released under the now-defunct former production label PlayStation Originals prior to the creation of PlayStation Productions: Heavenly Sword, which was released in 2014, and Ratchet & Clank, which was released by Gramercy Pictures in 2016 to largely unfavorable reviews from critics.
The PlayStation Network began to produce and distribute their own original content around the spring of 2015.  The first original scripted program, Powers, aired on March 10, 2015, and ran for two complete seasons. The series was discontinued on August 3, 2016. Until 2020, no more attempts would be made to adapt PlayStation intellectual properties.
Sony Interactive Entertainment launched PlayStation Productions in 2019 with a focus on adapting the company's video game franchises into films and television shows. An emphasis was placed on coordination between the film and television departments at Sony Pictures with the video game development studios at SIE Worldwide Studios. In December 2020, Tony Vinciquerra, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures, revealed that Sony was working on three movies and seven TV shows based on PlayStation video game content.
