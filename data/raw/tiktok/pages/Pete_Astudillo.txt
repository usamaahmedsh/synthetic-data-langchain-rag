Pedro Astudillo (born on December 1, 1963), is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, and dancer. Referred to as "the Latino Babyface" by The Daily Journal, he is credited as a key figure behind Selena's signature music style. Astudillo wrote or collaborated on some of the most popular Tejano music songs of the 1990s and was inducted into the Tejano Roots Hall of Fame in 2019. His impact on the United States Latin music scene lies in his role as a songwriter collaborator, according to Billboard magazine.
After high school, he pursued music education, forming Los Bad Boyz with Joe Ojeda. Discovered by a local DJ, they joined Selena y Los Dinos, integrating in December 1988. Astudillo's addition involved harmonizing with Selena and performing various roles within the band's dynamic. Astudillo's contribution to songwriting for the group began with "Besitos" (1989), co-written with the group's producer-songwriter A. B. Quintanilla, leading Selena y Los Dinos to explore the cumbia genre. His compositions for Ven Conmigo (1990) contributed to its commercial success, ranking among the longest-running albums on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart. Supported by Los Dinos and signed to Q-Productions, Astudillo released his debut solo album, Entregate a Mi, in January 1992.
Astudillo remained dedicated to Selena y Los Dinos, contributing to songwriting while on tour. He and A. B. co-wrote "Como la Flor" (1992), which became one of the most popular songs recorded by an artist of Mexican descent in the US. At the 1994 BMI Latin Music Awards, Astudillo received Songwriter of the Year honors. He co-wrote "Amor Prohibido" and "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" for Selena's Amor Prohibido (1994), both becoming chart-toppers on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart, while the latter became the most successful US Latin single of 1994. On March 31, 1995, Selena was shot and killed and Astudillo resumed performing during the opening of Sea World Texas, while still recovering from his mother's death the year prior.
Astudillo released Como Te Extrano on December 1, 1995, as the title track served as a tribute to Selena and Astudillo's mother, Paz. The titular track peaked at number one on the Regional Mexican Songs chart, remaining for ten consecutive weeks. Astudillo received Most Promising Band honors at the 1996 Tejano Music Awards and began to be hailed as the "next big thing" in the Tejano market. At the 1996 BMI Latin Music Awards, Astudillo tied with Juan Luis Guerra for Songwriter of the Year. Si Tu No Estas (1997) failed to replicate the commercial success achieved by its predecessor, as well as ¿Dónde Estás Amor? (1999). Astudillo left Q-Productions in 2001 to forge his label, Peace Rock Records, and released his albums independently. After a stint as a rocker with Ruido Añejo in the early 2010s, Astudillo returned to Tejano music with his band, Pete Astudillo y Tekno-Mex. His collaboration with A. B., on "Pelón" for Boyz of Kumbia, peaked at number 38 on Billboard's Regional Mexican Songs chart in April 2021.


== Life and career ==


=== 1981–1988: Early life and career beginnings ===
Pedro Astudillo was born on December 1, 1963, at the Las Palmas ranch in Laredo, Texas. His parents, Pedro and Paz Astudillo, are Mexican immigrants from Guerrero, and arrived in the United States in 1962. Astudillo worked alongside his parents and siblings on farms in Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana, thinning beets and potatoes, until he was 13 years old. He described working in the fields as demanding but rewarding for the strong familial bonds. Astudillo worked as a dishwasher and later a cook at his family's restaurant. Singing in his church choir gave Astudillo an outlet, although he initially felt shy about it. Astudillo found himself drawn to music class. At the age of nine or ten, Astudillo began writing love poems and songs to express himself. Astudillo acknowledged that it was never a planned endeavor to become a singer, but rather a surprise discovery. He initially began singing on a whim, without any preconceived notions of pursuing it as a career. As he delved deeper into the craft, Astudillo found himself enamored with singing and composing lyrics. Astudillo was raised in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood but remained resolute in his pursuit of a musical career.
Astudillo graduated from Laredo Nixon High School in 1982. In 1984, after spending a few years at Laredo College, he opened a restaurant with his brother in Loveland, Colorado. Despite this business venture, Astudillo harbored a passion for music and was determined to pursue a music career. He reapplied for college, majoring in accounting and attending vocal classes, and worked at his father's restaurant in Laredo. In 1985, Astudillo revealed his aspirations to his family, who were surprised as he had not previously disclosed his passion for music to them. Astudillo met Joe Ojeda through a mutual friend, who was seeking a lead singer. They formed Los Bad Boyz, making their debut at Astudillo's brother, Rogelio Astudillo's, catering business's reception hall. Rogelio often recommended Los Bad Boyz to patrons who were unable to afford live music. Los Bad Boyz faced challenges securing larger gigs and rejection from promoters, even after offering to perform for free. Astudillo attributed this to their relative obscurity and the skepticism surrounding the potential of a two-person band.
Feeling overwhelmed by its challenges, Astudillo and Ojeda considered quitting music. During one of their performances at a flea market, they were discovered by local DJ, The Bird El Locutor #2. Astudillo described it as a stroke of luck, feeling they were in the right place at the right time. In August 1988, The Bird extended Los Bad Boyz a regular slot at Rox-Z's in Laredo on Tuesdays during Tejano nights, though they performed unpaid. Despite their performances, Los Bad Boyz went unnoticed as they were relatively unknown. The club's owners and workers appreciated their music, prompting The Bird to propose to management that whenever a popular band or performance was scheduled, Los Bad Boyz could open for them. The following month, Los Bad Boyz opened for Selena y Los Dinos. The group consisted of lead singer Selena, A. B. Quintanilla as the band's producer-songwriter, and bassist, Suzette Quintanilla on drums, keyboardist-songwriter Ricky Vela, and Jesse Ybarra on guitar. Selena y Los Dinos was managed by the Quintanilla's father Abraham Quintanilla. By 1988, Selena y Los Dinos was ranked the most requested band in ten out of fifteen Tejano music radio stations in Texas. Astudillo remarked that he knew who Selena was, but noted that he was not too into Tejano music at the time.
Abraham was initially skeptical of Los Bad Boyz opening for Selena y Los Dinos because they were a two-person group. However, Los Bad Boyz's performance made a positive impression on Selena y Los Dinos and Abraham. After the show, Abraham approached Los Bad Boyz and inquired about their management and booking, offering his business card, and requested them to call him the following Monday to discuss potential future collaborations. Abraham asked Los Bad Boyz if they would go on the road with them as their opening act, which they did for the next two months. They opened for Selena y Los Dinos in various cities, as a strong friendship with A. B. began to develop. Astudillo stated how he and Ojeda "were happy just to be on the same stage with [Selena y Los Dinos]", and thought that the group was "just being polite" when they were asked to continue to support the group as opening acts. Astudillo likened Selena y Los Dinos to the "Latino Brady Bunch" and described Selena as "goofy, crazy and loud".
A. B. gradually persuaded Abraham, though initially reluctant due to financial concerns and the band's nascent success, to incorporate Los Bad Boyz into the group. Ultimately, A. B. convinced Abraham, allowing Astudillo and Ojeda to integrate into Selena y Los Dinos. Astudillo and Ojeda joined the group on December 25, 1988, following a show in Midland, Texas. Astudillo experienced a profound sense of fulfillment when he was invited to join Selena y Los Dinos, feeling as though his aspirations had finally materialized. Astudillo's addition to Selena y Los Dinos involved harmonizing with Selena and performing duets with the singer, as well as being a hype man, dancer, and roadie within the band's dynamic. Astudillo often performed duets with Selena on tour, while Ojeda joined as the second keyboardist. Astudillo brought complex lyrics and melodies with lots of chords to his songwriting assistance for the group.


=== 1989–1991: Selena y Los Dinos ===

During the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, Rick Trevino invited Selena y Los Dinos to be the opening act for the awards ceremony after La Sombra declined the offer. Representatives from CBS Records and newly formed EMI Latin attended the awards event to scout for new musical acts. EMI Latin's president, Jose Behar, wanted to sign Selena y Los Dinos to his label, while CBS was offering twice EMI's offer. Abraham found EMI Latin's proposal appealing due to the potential for a crossover deal, and he intended for his children to be the first musicians to sign with the company.
The production of the group's debut album began in June 1989. The goal of Selena was to be an introduction to the international Latin music market, with future sights into an English-language crossover. The band became "a bit more trendier and a little bit cutting-edge" on Selena with experimental production and songwriting. It was the first album with any production and songwriting assistance from Astudillo and Ojeda. Astudillo discovered his ability to write songs when he started collaborating with A. B. It wasn't until their initial songwriting session that Astudillo thought he could "do that." Vela and Astudillo began elaborating the arrangements in their music production.
Astudillo first contributed to songwriting with "Besitos", a track he co-wrote with A.B. Quintanilla. This song marked a significant turning point for the band, encouraging them to delve deeper into the cumbia genre in subsequent releases. Astudillo's collaboration with A. B. guided the band towards a more danceable style infused with cumbia influences. This fusion, according to Pamela Colloff of Texas Monthly, drew elements of funk and hip-hop, creating a distinctive and vibrant sound.
During the recording sessions for the duet "Amame, Quiereme", Astudillo felt overwhelmed by the professionalism of Los Dinos in the studio, as the group had high expectations for him to match their level. It was Astudillo's first recording session in a studio, and Suzette remarked that Astudillo was noticeably nervous during the sessions. Astudillo was removed from the studio after an unsuccessful session; he expressed his disappointment at not meeting the desired range. After a friend of his successfully hit the required range and with encouragement, Astudillo retried and met the required demands for the track. Astudillo said his aspirations of recording in a professional studio inspired him not to give up. Writing for the El Paso Times, Maria Cortes Gonzalez called Astudillo's vocals on the track as being sexy, and seductive. "Amame, Quiereme" was nominated for Vocal Duo of the Year at the 1990 Tejano Music Awards.
Astudillo and Abraham wrote "Sukiyaki"–originally a 1960s Japanese song by Kyu Sakamoto–into a Spanish-language song. Vela, who intended to be involved in the writing process, acknowledged Astudillo's songwriting skills and Spanish fluency, ultimately preferring Astudillo's approach for "Sukiyaki". Astudillo assisted with the arrangements for "My Love" on Selena, to which Selena's biographer, Joe Nick Patoksi, interpreted the track as an homage to Madonna. Astudillo recorded the duet with Selena on "Yo Te Amo" for Ven Conmigo (1990), which was nominated for Vocal Duo of the Year at the 1992 Tejano Music Awards. The band opted for a bridge-interlude structure for "Yo Te Amo", instead of their usual recycled chord progression, reflecting their growth and evolution. The song's form wasn't distinctly Texan or Mexican but represented international Spanish music that was masked within a slow cumbia framework. Other tracks Astudillo wrote for the album includes, "Baila Esta Cumbia", "Enamorada de Ti", and "No Quiero Saber". "Baila Esta Cumbia" was certified 6× platinum (Latin) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting 360,000 units consisting of sales and on-demand streaming in the United States. The compositions Astudillo wrote or co-wrote were largely responsible for Ven Conmigo's continued commercial success on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart, which by March 1992, ranked as the second-most weeks an album has remained on the chart behind Ana Gabriel by two weeks. The album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" in 2021.


=== 1992: Solo career with Oxygeno and Entre a Mi Mundo ===

Los Dinos supported Astudillo's desire to go solo. With A. B.'s support, they began work on his debut album during their spare time amidst Selena y Los Dinos' busy schedule. Astudillo's rapid rise led Abraham and EMI Latin to recognize his potential as a solo artist. Los Dinos contributed instrumentally to his album, with A. B. co-writing six tracks and producing the record. Music critic for the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, Rene Cabrera, proclaimed Astudillo as possessing the requisite attributes to succeed as a soloist, noting his adept vocal abilities harmonized with a polished and commanding stage demeanor.
Astudillo and his band Oxygeno began as opening acts to Selena y Los Dinos. Abraham became Astudillo's manager and signed him to his Q-Productions label with distribution through EMI Latin. Astudillo released his debut album, Entregate a Mi, in January 1992. By March, Entregate a Mi was performing well in local markets. The singles, "Un Hombre Busca Una Mujer", a cover of Luis Miguel, "Porque Le Gusta Bailar Cumbia", "Nada Nada", and the title track, were receiving heavy airplay in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Austin, McAllen, Lubbock, Alice, Laredo, Corpus Christi, and Houston, Texas. "Porque Le Gusta Bailar Cumbia" was often the most requested song by fans.
Astudillo, despite pursuing a solo career, remained dedicated to Selena y Los Dinos, emphasizing his loyalty to the band. He continued to contribute songwriting while touring. When asked if he would depart Los Dinos to continue his solo career, Astudillo responded that he would not leave the band, saying, "I'm a Dino, part of the family. This group is solid and I like it here." The band's album, Entre a Mi Mundo aimed to propel them into the Mexican and Latin American markets. One of the tracks, "Como la Flor", penned by Astudillo and A. B., emerged from genuine emotions, despite initial disagreements over its theme. "Como la Flor" became one of the most popular songs recorded by an artist of Mexican descent in the US. Ilan Stavans credits the rise of Latin pop in the US during the 1990s to the widespread appeal of "Como la Flor". Widely considered to be Selena's signature song and her "trademark", "Como la Flor" has become a posthumous epithet and swan song, as well as her most popular recording. It is one of her "most celebrated" songs and has become part of the Texas musical canon. The RIAA certified "Como la Flor" 9× platinum (Latin).
Other songs Astudillo wrote or co-wrote for Entre a Mi Mundo, like the Juan Gabriel-inspired "¿Qué Creías?", "Vuelve a Mí", and the comical "La Carcacha", drew inspiration from everyday life. "¿Qué Creías?" was certified gold (Latin), while "La Carcacha" was certified 3× platinum (Latin) by the RIAA. During the band's travels on the tour bus, Astudillo often hung out with A. B., guitarist Chris Pérez who joined the group following Ven Conmigo, Vela, and Ojeda. According to Pérez, Astudillo was supportive of his and Selena's relationship, despite her family and the other member's cautions about how Abraham would take it. Astudillo mentioned that although the band wasn't entirely certain, they had sensed that something was developing between Selena and Pérez. Pérez began dating Selena in secret. In reaction to her emotions for Pérez and their concealed relationship, Selena composed "Ámame" (1992) and sought lyrical assistance from Astudillo.


=== 1993–94: Separation from Selena y Los Dinos, Como Nadie, and Amor Prohibido ===
Astudillo received the nomination for Single of the Year for "Un Hombre Busca Una Mujer" as well as Male Vocalist of the Year at the 1993 Tejano Music Awards. Astudillo and Selena were nominated for Vocal Duo of the Year for "Siempre Estoy Pensando en Ti". Rene Cabrera of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, found Astudillo's rendition of "Un Hombre Busca Una Mujer" at the awards ceremony commendable, which demonstrated his readiness to embrace challenges, tackling a demanding arrangement.
Astudillo made his debut appearance on television with his band on the Johnny Canales Show on November 19, 1993. The following week, his single "Ganar O Perder" debuted at number nine on the indie Tejano Singles music chart in Texas. Music critic for the El Paso Times, Ramiro Burr named "Ganar O Perder" as one of the "hot cuts on Tejano radio". The single peaked at number three on the music chart on the week ending December 23, 1993. Astudillo began working on this third studio album in January 1994. He was nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year and Vocal Duo of the Year with Selena at the 1994 Tejano Music Awards.
In February 1994, Abraham advocated for Astudillo's emancipation from Selena y Los Dinos, recognizing his potential for solo success. Astudillo welcomed the chance to showcase his abilities independently, eager to perform more of his material. Despite claims mentioned in the Del Rio News-Herald about relying on Selena's fame, Astudillo felt proud of his journey with her, asserting his ability to stand on his own merit as a solo artist. Maldonado remarked that witnessing Astudillo's departure from Selena y Los Dinos was difficult, as their onstage chemistry and mutual support had become integral to their performances. Astudillo separated from Oxygeno and embarked on conceptualizing a distinctive moniker for his new band which included Jesse Jesus Ybarra on guitar, who formerly was the guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos in the 1980s, Danny Hernandez and Mike Hererra on keyboards, Sernando Orosco on bass, and Ricky Landeros on drums.
At the 1994 BMI Latin Music Awards, Astudillo won Songwriter of the Year. At the Tejano Music Awards, Astudillo and A.B. continued to be snubbed from Songwriter of the Year honors–a move criticized by Cabrera, who credited them as key contributors to Selena's works. Astudillo co-wrote "Amor Prohibido" and "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" for Selena's Amor Prohibido (1994), which became the two most popular tracks off the album. Astudillo remarked that co-writing "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", was one of the best memories he shared with Selena. "Amor Prohibido" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart the week ending June 11, 1994, and remained atop the chart for nine consecutive weeks becoming the most successful US Latin single of 1994. "Amor Prohibido" was certified 7× platinum (Latin) by the RIAA. "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" peaked at number one on October 29, 1994, and was certified 9× platinum (Latin) by the RIAA. Other tracks Astudillo wrote or co-wrote for Amor Prohibido include "Techno Cumbia", which was certified platinum (Latin), and "Si Una Vez" which was certified 3× platinum (Latin).
To promote Como Nadie (1993), Astudillo embarked on a tour in West Texas through eastern New Mexico. The single, "Piquito de Oro", made its debut at number six on the indie Tejano Singles music chart in Texas on the week ending April 7, 1994. The following tracking week, it peaked at number two. Astudillo's mother, Paz Astudillo, died on April 11, 1994. "Piquito de Oro", as well as the album's other singles; "Vas a Llorar", "Ganar O Perder", and "Acaso No Soy", were receiving considerable airplay in Texas. "Vas a Llorar" utilizes the backdrop of raindrops as a symbol of someone crying. The track debuted at number nine on the indie Tejano Singles music chart on the week ending June 2, 1994, it peaked at number two behind "Amor Prohibido" on the week ending July 3. "Vas a Llorar" reached the top 15 of the US Radio y Musica magazine's top Latin songs in Florida. Cortes Gonzalez felt that "Vas a Llorar" is a testament to Astudillo's talent as a songwriter and performer.
Astudillo's music videos began airing regularly on Univision. In August 1994, Astudillo began searching for an accordion player to join his band. Astudillo made his second appearance on the Johnny Canales Show on July 3, 1994. He also appeared on the music TV program Padrisimo on December 17, 1994. While Astudillo's initial albums, Entregate a Mi (1992) and Como Nadie (1993), did not secure positions on national music charts, The Odessa American expressed confidence in Astudillo's trajectory, foreseeing his ascent to prominence as one of the top Tejano artists in the industry. The newspaper lauded Astudillo for his vocal abilities and songwriting skill, attributing these talents as providing him with a distinct advantage and positioning him as a competitive contender in the Tejano market. The singles off Como Nadie continued to receive extensive airplay through 1995.


=== 1995: Death of Selena and Como Te Extrano ===
By 1995, Tejano became the fastest-growing Latin genre, with annual revenues topping $100 million. Astudillo collaborated with A. B. on the comical cumbia track "Asi Te Quiero" (1995) for Imagen Latina. On March 31, 1995, Selena was shot and killed. Astudillo spoke to KBNA-FM following the news, talking about Selena as he wept on air, as he was still recovering from his mother's death the year prior. He attended her funeral on April 3. Astudillo resumed performing during the all-star Cinco de Mayo celebration and Selena tribute during the opening of Sea World Texas. He commenced delivering his amalgamation of Selena's songs during his concerts, expressing that he manages her death like any other individual who deals with a loss. Astudillo expressed gratitude for the lessons gleaned from Selena, which facilitated his coping mechanisms.
In June 1995, "Amor Prohibido" became the first Spanish-language song to receive the BMI Pop Music Award. In July, Astudillo opened for Willie Nelson and received a commemorative plaque, along with Selena's family, which was hung at the Texas State Aquarium's Conservation Cove. Astudillo collaborated with Vela on "Estupido Romantico", which was recorded by Mazz. The track peaked within the top ten of the Hot Latin Songs chart in September 1995. Astudillo released his third studio album, Como Te Extrano, on December 1, 1995. Como Te Extrano marks Astudillo's first album in two years, a rarity in the Tejano market where prolonged breaks risk fading into obscurity. Despite industry norms, Como Te Extrano climbed the music charts of Radio y Musica.
The compositions on Como Te Extrano contain a mixture of pop cumbias and rancheras, typical of Tejano albums, with production by A. B. Mario Taradell of The Dallas Morning News, ranked it as one of the best Latin albums of 1995, praising Astudillo as the top composer in the market. Como Te Extrano sold 50,000 units within its first month, 100,000 units in seven weeks, and reached 200,000 units by January 1997. The sales achievement of Como Te Extrano solidified Astudillo's presence in the industry. The title track, written by Astudillo, Ojeda, and A. B., was recorded as a tribute to Selena and Astudillo's mother, Paz. The song emanated from Astudillo's emotions and heartfelt sentiments. Astudillo emphasized that the songwriting process was deeply personal, allowing him to express his feelings without pretense. It made its debut at number 15 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and number nine on the Regional Mexican Songs chart, in the week ending October 21, 1995. It peaked at number one on the Regional Mexican Songs chart, on the week ending November 18, 1995, where it remained atop the chart for ten consecutive weeks. "Como Te Extrano" peaked at number two on the Hot Latin Songs chart, on the week ending January 13, 1996.
Astudillo aimed to capture universal sentiments of longing and ache in "Como Te Extrano", purposefully omitting Selena and his mother's names to allow listeners to personalize the song.
 It became Astudillo's signature song. Driven by the emotive titular track, Como Te Extrano debuted at number eight on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart and at number two on the Regional Mexican Albums chart, behind Selena's Amor Prohibido, on the week ending November 25, 1995. The album maintained its position in the top ten of the Latin music charts for nearly four months. Como Te Extrano peaked at number six on the Top Latin Albums chart, on the week ending December 16, 1995. Paul Verna from Billboard magazine, hailed the album for its innovative blend of pop, cumbia, and ranchera styles that pushed the boundaries of Tejano music. Tracks like the rancheras "Si Me Vas a Dejar", "Cayo Una Lagrima", "Cree en Mi", and the pop cumbia "Completamente Enamorado", also received airplay. Despite "Yo Estare a Tu Lado" not gaining recognition, Cabrera praised it as an ode to true love, showcasing Astudillo and Vela's skillful writing and Jesse Garza's emotive performance on the requinto, which heightened the song's emotional impact.


=== 1996: Pete Astudillo y Grupo Futuro ===
In January 1996, Astudillo opted for a more contemporary and sophisticated appearance by cutting his long locks, despite reservations from EMI Latin and advice from his label's manager, Lee Garza. Astudillo jokingly cited piojos (head lice) as the reason for the change. Astudillo was inundated with requests from various musicians seeking material, among them were Liberación, Fugitivos, and Ramón Ayala. Astudillo debuted his band's new name, Grupo Futuro, during his concert at the Pure Country nightclub in Abilene, Texas. The band lineup remained mostly unchanged, with the addition of accordionist John Saenz. Astudillo co-headlined a sold-out concert in Odessa, Texas with Jennifer Peña, drawing a crowd of 18,000.
At the 1996 Tejano Music Awards, Astudillo received the nomination for Most Promising Band, Male Vocalist of the Year, Male Entertainer of the Year, and Song of the Year, along with Vela, for composing "Estupido Romantico". Cabrera anticipated Astudillo to win Most Promising Band, attributing it to the success of "Como Te Extrano", while Burr shared a similar expectation, foreseeing Astudillo's potential to secure several accolades owing to "Como Te Extrano"'s chart accomplishments. Astudillo won Most Promising Band, and began to be hailed as the "next big thing" in the Tejano market. By March 1996, Como Te Extrano was certified platinum (Latin) by the RIAA for shipments of 100,000 units in the United States, while former percussionist for Los Dinos, Arturo Meza joined Astudillo's band.
At the 1996 Premio Lo Nuestro, Astudillo received the nomination for Male Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, New Regional Mexican Artist, as well as Song of the Year for "Como Te Extrano". Astudillo performed at the Six Flags' Music Mill Amphitheatre, becoming the third Tejano act to perform at the theme park, following Emilio Navaira and Selena. Astudillo recorded "Tu Robaste Mi Corazón", originally performed by Selena and Navaira, for the Siempre Selena (1996) album. Cabrera perceived the new rendition's inclusion on the album as "sort of for old times sake", while Chris Riemenshneider of the Austin American-Statesman characterized it as an energetic Tejano track.
At the 1996 BMI Latin Music Awards, "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", "Si Una Vez", and "Amor Prohibido" received Song of the Year honors. Astudillo tied with Juan Luis Guerra for Songwriter of the Year. Astudillo expressed that being acknowledged as a songwriter held special significance for him, as he viewed writing as equally crucial to his artistry as performing. On March 9, 1996, Astudillo narrated a pay-per-view unaired 1991 Market Square concert of Selena y Los Dinos. For the first anniversary of Selena's death, Astudillo scheduled a tribute concert for the singer in Galveston, Texas along with Michael Salgado and Arnfulo Gonzales. "Si No Fui Yo", the second single released from Como Te Extrano, continued the band's success following "Como Te Extrano".
During Billboard's mid-year recap, Astudillo ranked as the sixth most-popular Regional Mexican Songs chart artist. "Como Te Extrano" ranked as the second-most popular song on the Regional Mexican Songs chart, and the album ranked at number two on the Regional Mexican Albums list, which enabled him to rank as the third-most-popular Regional Mexican Albums artist. Astudillo, along with other artists signed to EMI Latin, was acknowledged for contributing to the label's sustained dominance of the Latin music charts in 1996. "Como Te Extrano" ended 1996 as the fifth most-popular US Latin song as well as the second-most-popular US Regional Mexican Song, Como Te Extrano was the fourth best-selling Regional Mexican Album, while Astudillo ranked as the sixth most-successful regional Mexican artist of 1996 and the 22nd most-successful Latin songwriter of the year.


=== 1997–2000: Selena, Si Tu No Estas, and ¿Dónde Estás Amor? ===
Astudillo joined the cast of Selena (1997), a biographical film directed by Gregory Nava, portraying himself as a dancer and backup vocalist to Jennifer Lopez's portrayal of Selena. He considered it important to contribute to the film's success, drawing from his personal experiences with Selena to assist his co-stars. Astudillo struggled to contain his emotions during the film's premiere, finding it challenging to watch recreated moments he described as "the happiest moments of my life". Despite inconveniences such as early morning filming schedules as a result of cutting his hair, Astudillo actively promoted the film during a special edition of El Show de Cristina, and provided live performances to entertain extras during filming. His inclusion in the film's Houston Astrodome scene was seen as a recognition of his significance within Los Dinos by the producers.
For the Selena soundtrack, Astudillo recorded the tribute track, "Vivirás Selena" along with Graciela Beltrán, Bobby Pulido, the Barrio Boyzz, Navaira, and Peña. While Riemenschneider found "Vivirás Selena" to have lacked the distinctive Tejano flavor, he still regarded it as a pleasant tribute to Selena. Conversely, Mary Christina Vera, also from the Austin American-Statesman, disagreed with Riemenschneider's critique. She found the track to be one of the best recordings on the soundtrack, despite its departure from traditional Tejano beats. Vera felt the song was intended to be a slower, toned-down track.
At the 1997 BMI Latin Music Awards, Astudillo was awarded Songwriter of the Year. At the 1997 Tejano Music Awards, Astudillo received Song of the Year for "Como Te Extrano", Male Vocalist of the Year, and won Orchestra/Group Album of the Year for Como Te Extrano, and Overall Album of the Year nominations. In March 1997, Astudillo released his lead single, "Si Tu No Estas". The track debuted and peaked at number 37 on the Hot Latin Songs chart, on the week ending June 14, 1997. The album of the same name was released in June 1997. Si Tu No Estas debuted and peaked at number 37 on the Top Latin Albums chart, on the week ending June 14, 1997.
At the 1997 Pura Vida Awards, Astudillo faced logistical issues that delayed the show's commencement as he was slated to co-host alongside George Rivas. Due to last-minute agreement forms presented by producers, Astudillo and other musicians, including A. B., declined to sign due to excessively restrictive terms. The terms granted rights to the musicians' vocal performances from that night for commercial purposes, without additional compensation to the artists or their labels, violating their label agreement. Tensions escalated backstage as producers issued ultimatums, warning that musicians who refused would not perform that night, resulting in an 11-hour standoff. Eventually, producers relented, allowing musicians to sign only the standard release forms. As a result of the delay, only a few artists could perform that evening.
To support Si Tu No Estas, Astudillo embarked on a tour. The majority of his concerts were done in Texas, while he ventured into Georgia, Florida, Michigan, and Arizona. Astudillo expressed satisfaction with the reception he had received during his tour, noting invitations to return to Georgia and Florida. Devoting eleven months of the year to touring, Astudillo confessed that he finds fulfillment in performance and would feel despondent without it. During any downtime from performances, he engaged in songwriting and music production endeavors. Si Tu No Estas failed to replicate the commercial success achieved by its predecessor, Como Te Extrano. Astudillo believed that Si Tu No Estas contained material of equal or superior quality, though acknowledged its success did not measure up to that of Como Te Extrano. He co-wrote with A. B. "La Chica Sabrosura" (1997) for Lobo IV.
Astudillo was nominated for Song of the Year for "Si Tu No Estas", Male Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, and Tejano Crossover Song of the Year for "No Lo Niego" at the 1998 Tejano Music Awards. Astudillo was featured on Puro Tejano en Vivo along with La Tropa F on March 25, 1998, and released a promotional jingle for the Laredo National Bank. He participated in VH1's Behind the Music episode that highlighted Selena on March 29, 1998.
In September 1998, Astudillo released his lead single, "¿Dónde Estás Amor?". Describing it as a romantic cumbia infused with accordion melodies, Astudillo highlighted the album's diverse offerings. Alongside norteño-style tracks reimagined in his distinctive manner, the album features mariachi compositions and a cumbia mariachi number. Astudillo aimed to cater to a broad audience, believing the album's varied content would resonate with younger and older listeners. He expressed a commitment to crafting music that transcends industry standards, prioritizing songs that resonate with the public's preferences over those solely aimed at garnering industry acclaim.
On April 20, 1999, ¿Dónde Estás Amor? was released, and at the 1999 Tejano Music Awards, Astudillo received the nomination for Best Mariachi Song by a Tejano Artist for "No Lo Niego". Astudillo performed during the 41st annual Feria de Las Flores pageant on August 12, 2000, held at the Selena Auditorium within the Bayfront Convention Center. Olga Tañon bought ¿Dónde Estás Amor?, her first of many records to "make up time" to listen to newer artists' works. Astudillo became troubled by the lackluster sales of ¿Dónde Estás Amor?, despite his belief in its quality. He acknowledged that sales were disappointing, leading to concerns about future sales, his performance, and overall direction.


=== 2001–2002: Departure from Q-Productions, founding of Peace Rock Records ===
Astudillo decided to part ways with Q-Productions in 2001 due to "creative differences" regarding his career trajectory. He revealed that discussions with EMI Latin indicated a softening Tejano market, and the label suggested that he had already passed his professional peak. Negotiations with EMI Latin and Q-Productions failed to yield agreeable terms. Astudillo founded Peace Rock Records, an extension of Peace Rock Publishing, aligning with the pattern observed among Tejano artists venturing into autonomous record labels amidst the genre's persistent downturn. Astudillo avowed his proclivity for proactive engagement, eschewing passivity, remarking, "I'm a hands-on kind of guy", preferring not to await opportunities idly. He observed that assuming a passive role merely facilitated the presentation of ideas, yet failed to garner financial support from record executives, reflecting the prevailing sentiment among executives that Tejano is in decline and lamenting the genre's perceived stagnation, deeming it is "not where it's at".
Astudillo released his first album independently, El Rey del Ritmo, in August 2001, and ranked among the most appealing musicians in the Tejano market. Astudillo characterized the album as a fusion of diverse rhythms rooted in Tejano influences. The Corpus Christi Caller-Times observed that Astudillo unleashed a torrent of Latin sounds, incorporating various musical elements into El Rey del Ritmo with uninhibited creativity. The title track climbed the Radio y Musica charts and received considerable airplay on Latin music stations across the country. Cabrera described the title track as a vibrant dance
offering with robust percussion, complemented by an accordion melody and Astudillo's signature vocals. Cabrera observed an abundance of rhythmic diversity infused with cumbia and South American dance influences in songs like "La Negra Tomasa", "Tu Tanga", and "Mira Como Se Le Mueve". The latter, along with "No Te Perdono", features horn-driven arrangements with bold and assertive characteristics distinct from his earlier works.
In "Me Estas Doliendo el Corazon" and "Tequila Con Lagrimas", Astudillo shifts to cater to fans with more conventional preferences, according to Cabrera, who found that both tracks exemplify Astudillo's style for approaching themes from unique perspectives. "Me Estas Doliendo el Corazon" offers a classic Tejano sound infused with a cumbia rhythm and personal lyrics drawn from Astudillo's experiences. The track was written for Astudillo's mother from his father's viewpoint. "Tequila Con Lagrimas" delves into the theme of lost love and emotional turmoil, offering solace through the metaphor of tequila therapy. Cabrera noted "Una Flor Lloro" as a poignant track exploring themes of betrayal, showcasing Astudillo's adeptness at employing metaphor and symbolism. Astudillo began experimenting with vallenato-influenced tracks in his Tejano recordings, following the footsteps of other Tejano artists.
By 2002, Astudillo took a brief hiatus from the music scene to care for his aging father. Additionally, he noticed a decline in bookings for his performances, which prompted him to reassess his career direction. He produced singer Sesi's Chiquita Pero Picosa (2001) album. Astudillo and A. B. wrote, "Yo No Fui" (2002), a song that revolves around a womanizer who habitually makes excuses for his actions, for Big Circo. The song merges norteño cumbia rhythms with the rock-infused vocals of accordionist and vocalist Big Boy. Writing for The Monitor, Joe Zepeda believed that the track would seamlessly blend in with the songs during Tejano's golden age in the early 1990s. Astudillo recorded "Eclipse", a duet with Denisse, on her debut album in 2002.


=== 2003–2009: Enfoque Musical and Selena ¡Vive! ===
On July 9, 2003, Astudillo announced plans to release his first album in over two years, emphasizing quality over frequency and aiming to reconnect with the Mexican music market. Astudillo remarked that the project had blended romantic cumbias, pop, Colombian influences, and rock elements. He wanted the album to showcase his diverse musical passions and wanted to target a younger audience. Astudillo initiated negotiations with Universal Music Group, Univison, and Sony for a distribution deal for his album.
In 2005, Astudillo became a co-host for Enfoque Musical, an entertainment TV program broadcast in South Texas. Astudillo took part in the all-star Selena ¡Vive!, a benefit concert commemorating the 10th anniversary of the singer's death, where he performed "Como Te Extrano". Juan Martin Ovalle of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram observed that Astudillo performed the track with full intensity. Olivia Ruiz of The Fresno Bee and Rogelio Olivas of the Tucson Citizen, regarded Astudillo's performance of "Como Te Extrano" as one of the most emotionally charged moments of the concert. Ruiz noted that Astudillo's rendition moved those in attendance to tears, including Selena's mother, Marcela. Astudillo was the master of ceremonies for the 2006 Little Miss Fitness held in McAllen.

The album featured a revamped version of "Como Te Extrano" as well as a 1980s power ballad rendition of "Como la Flor", and the ballad "Quiero Llorar". Ruido Añejo strategically decided to debut their softer material at the 2013 Tejano Music Awards as a means to appeal to the traditional audience. They were concerned that performing their hard rock songs might deter them.

The track features cumbia rhythms with reggaeton and electric guitar by Garcia. In 2024, Astudillo released the corrido "Esta Es Pa' Mi Raza", after realizing he had yet to release a song about his family and upbringing.

His performance style is characterized by its dynamic energy and infectious rhythms, often involving the crowd. He attributes his approach to concert performances to Selena, whose stage persona left a mark on Astudillo's performance style.

Elizabeth Campbell of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram discerned Astudillo's vocals as opulent and refined, amidst his tenure alongside Los Dinos on tour.
Astudillo's songs draw from personal experiences, reflecting varied emotions. While often melancholic, he asserts that not all of his repertoire is sad and finds authenticity to be paramount. Astudillo considers himself a meticulous songwriter who is open to unconventional ideas like using "stupid" in "Estupido Romantico".

Astudillo's fusion of Latin music with Afro-Caribbean rhythms enchanted audiences, transcending Texas borders with a sophisticated sound, noted by Marty Racine of the Houston Chronicle.
