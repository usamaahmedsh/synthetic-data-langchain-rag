According to ByteDance (parent company of TikTok) for a YiCai article, the company acquired Smartisan's tech-related patent rights and signed contracts with all of its hardware division employees and some of its software division employees in 2019. It was rumored by market analysts that ByteDance planned to produce education hardware, such as smart desk lamps. Notably, Smartisan's next phone, the Nut Pro 3, was preinstalled with Douyin, the Chinese-localized version of TikTok. 
In 2021, ByteDance halted Smartisan's device production to refocus on its line of hardware products for the education sector.  It has not yet put on sale any education hardware.
