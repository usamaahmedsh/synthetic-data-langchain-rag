== History ==
The magazine was founded by Jim Warren in 1978 as The Intelligent Machines Journal (IMJ).
In February 1980, one year after being sold to International Data Group (IDG), the magazine changed its name to InfoWorld. In 1986, the Robert X. Cringely column began; for many, that pseudonymous column was the face of InfoWorld and its close ties to Silicon Valley in particular.
Up to and including the 15 June 1987 issue 24, volume 9, InfoWorld was published by Popular Computing, Inc., a subsidiary of CW Communications, Inc. Since then, it has been published by InfoWorld Publishing, Inc., a subsidiary of IDG Communications, Inc.
Ethernet inventor Bob Metcalfe was CEO and publisher from 1991 to 1996, and contributed a weekly column until 2000. As the magazine transitioned to be exclusively Web-based, the final print edition was dated 2 April 2007 (Volume 29, Issue 14, Number 1384).
In its web incarnation, InfoWorld has transitioned away from widely available news stories to a focus on how-to, expert testing, and thought leadership.
