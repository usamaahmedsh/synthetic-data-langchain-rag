Regency Enterprises, Inc. is an entertainment company formed by Arnon Milchan. It was founded on July 12, 1991 as the successor to Regency International Pictures (formerly known as Embassy International Pictures N.V.).


== History ==


=== Origins (1982–1991) ===
Arnon Milchan founded his company as Embassy International Pictures N.V., which held the name for seven years until it was changed to Regency International Pictures. This company originally had no distribution deal of producing films with various studios such as The Ladd Company, Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Warner Bros., Touchstone Pictures, Vestron Pictures, Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox (now known as 20th Century Studios), with the latter ending up being the distributor of the majority of Regency's library. It produced films such as Once Upon a Time in America and Q&A, but was shut down in 1991.


=== New Regency (1991–present) ===
On January 15, 1991, Milchan and Regency, as well as Scriba & Deyle of Germany and Canal+ of France, formed a $600 million joint venture to finance 20 films in five years, all of which were to be distributed by Warner Bros. Therefore, Regency International Pictures became the holding company for all Milchan’s investments and was legally renamed as Regency Enterprises (doing business as Arnon Milchan Enterprises) and two new companies (both 100% held by Regency Enterprises) were established to produce movies: one to do business in the United States and legally named Regency Entertainment (USA), Inc., one to do business overseas and legally named Monarchy Enterprises S.á.r.l. and both known under the umbrella trade name of Regency or New Regency Productions. The offices of New Regency were located on the Warner Bros. lot.
Founder Arnon Milchan's daughter Alexandra Milchan headed their offshoot "Regency Vision", originally intended as a competitor to companies like New Line Cinema's Fine Line Features, a "specialty features" division.
On March 24, 1999, Regency executive David Matalon joined the supervisory board of Puma AG, an international sports company. At the time, Regency Enterprises (the holding company) was the largest single shareholder in Puma, with more than a 25% stake. The stake was sold for $676 million in May 2003.
On September 9, 1997, Milchan signed a 15-year distribution pact with 20th Century Fox worldwide in all media with the exception of foreign television rights, ending the previous association with Warner Bros. (1991–1999). Fox also funneled $200 million in New Regency, in exchange for a 20% stake in the company. The company’s offices were moved to the Fox lot (where are still located). On January 17, 2011, Fox and New Regency extended the pact, to expire in 2022.
On May 21, 2008, they hired Hutch Parker as co-chairman of the studio. He would eventually left the post on January 11, 2012. In July of that same year New Regency announced that they launched a film production joint venture with British-based entertainment production company Shine Group to launch Shine Pictures with the former's Hutch Parker & Bob Harper joining the new subsidiary along with Shine Group's CEO Elizabeth Murdoch.
In June 2012, New Regency announced that they formed a deal with EMJAG Digital Production and Shine America to create and distribute digital content. Under the deal with EMJAG Digital Productions, New Regency along with Shine America will co-produce and co-finance select digital products under a first-look deal with EMJAG's previous deal with Paramount being transferred to New Regency and Shine America.
In May 2016, New Regency announced that Brad Weston had stepped of the company as CEO and president after five years as Yariv Milchan the son of New Regency's founder Arnon Milchan had joined the company and became their new chairman and CEO.
In January 2019, New Regency re-formed its international sales team to take back control of its international television licensing activities.
The Walt Disney Company inherited Fox's stake in New Regency Productions after Disney acquired 21st Century Fox's assets on March 20, 2019. Following the acquisition, 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight Pictures became divisions of Walt Disney Studios and were renamed 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures, respectively, on January 17, 2020. On December 13, 2021, New Regency renewed their global distribution deal with Disney. This includes Disney's handling of global theatrical distribution, home entertainment, and first pay rights for New Regency. New Regency's sales team, led by Charlotte Thorp and primarily based out of London, United Kingdom will handle all other television and SVOD rights after the first pay window as well as other business development.
In June 2025, New Regency began a partnership with Shamrock Capital.
New Regency has at least 100 movies to its credit. The company produced 2013's 12 Years a Slave, 2014's Birdman, and 2015's The Revenant, which earned the company two Academy Awards for Best Picture in a row, and three nominations.


== New Regency Television International ==
New Regency Television International (formerly known as Regency Television) is a joint venture between Regency Enterprises and Fox Television Studios founded in 1998. Regency's best-known television shows include The WB/UPN sci-fi drama Roswell and the Fox sitcoms Malcolm in the Middle and The Bernie Mac Show.
On July 17, 2007, Regency Television shut down all production and closed its business after nine years in operation. On January 17, 2011, New Regency announced a return to the television business after 20th Century Fox extended its distribution business with Regency until 2022. Since New Regency re-formed its international sales team to take back control of its international television licensing activities in January 2019, Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution now handles domestic television rights to 1984's Once Upon a Time in America and the 1991–1999 Regency Enterprises library (except 1993's Six Degrees of Separation).
New Regency Television International launched at the start of 2019. Based out of London and drawing from New Regency's long-established relationships with the best writing, directing and producing talent, the division is focused on developing and producing high-end, authored and distinctive scripted content for the international marketplace.
