"Another Love" is a song by English singer-songwriter Tom Odell, released in October 2012 as his debut single and lifted from his debut extended play, Songs from Another Love (2012). It serves as the first single on his debut studio album Long Way Down (2013).
In 2013, the song became a major commercial success in Europe, peaking at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, and becoming Odell's first top-ten hit in that country. Outside the UK, the song charted on the Billboard Global 200, where it debuted on 24 April 2021, and reached a peak position of 14 on 29 October 2022. The song has also been on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 and the TikTok Billboard Top 50.
In 2022, a decade after its release, the song re-appeared on charts across Europe and Australia after becoming popular on TikTok and on other social media platforms as an anthem in support of Ukraine following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting wave of refugees from Ukraine across Europe. The song represented a sign of hope for many people. Throughout Europe, the performance of the song was part of public events and demonstrations. Odell himself performed his song on 12 March 2022, at Bucharest North railway station, a main hub for refugees on their way through Romania.
The song returned to its number 10 UK Singles Chart position in January 2023. As of May 2025, the song has amassed over 3.0 billion streams on Spotify.


== Music video ==
A music video to accompany the release of "Another Love" was first released onto YouTube on 5 November 2012 at a total length of four minutes and seven seconds. It depicts Odell sitting in an armchair in front of the camera as a girl played by actress Hanako Footman attempts to get his attention. He, however seems to notice neither her nor any of his other surroundings. As time passes, the girl begins to feel more and more annoyed and disappears from screen, seemingly leaving Odell.
Another video was released, called the "short film" version, for the song's American release. It shows Odell walking the streets and showing missing person notices for a woman he does not recognize when he finally comes across her. The video features actress Sarah Navratil.
