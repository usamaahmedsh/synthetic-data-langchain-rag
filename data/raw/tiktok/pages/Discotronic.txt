Discotronic is an Austrian dance and hands-up project of two Vienna producers, Thomas Greisl and Steve Twain (Stephan Deutsch).

The producer duo of Thomas Greisl and Steve Twain (Stephan Deutsch) founded the dance project Discotronic in 2006. The first single, "Tricky Disco", developed into a European club hit. In Germany, the single charted in the top 5 of the dance charts. Discotronic followed up with two more singles, "World of Discotronic / Now is the Time" and "The Master Plan."
