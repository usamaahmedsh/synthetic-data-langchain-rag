== Personal ==
In 2009, Szczur donated bone marrow to a 15-month-old Ukrainian girl named Anastasia battling leukemia. Szczur essentially saved the girl's life given the severity of her condition and how hard it would have been to find another person that was a match for bone marrow. He met the healthy 4-year-old girl and her parents via Skype using a translator who was present at Anastasia's house. It was documented in E:60 Risking it All, which is one of ESPN's E:60 presentations.
Szczur and his wife, Natalie, were married in November 2014 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They have two children, a son and a daughter.
After retiring from baseball, Szczur gained a following on Instagram and TikTok, where he posted videos of his paintings.
