Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe Ltd. (also known as Great Marlborough Productions), formerly Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe and Cartoon Network Studios Europe, is a British animation studio headquartered in London, England, and owned by the UK division of Warner Bros. International Television Production, a subsidiary of the Warner Bros. Discovery International, ultimately owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. The studio is the EMEA production arm of Cartoon Network Studios, and was founded on 18 September 2007.
On 7 April 2021, WarnerMedia announced it had rebranded the studio to Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe, in honor of the original Hollywood-based studio and its co-founders William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The Hanna-Barbera name had previously been revived on certain Warner Bros. Animation productions based on the classic franchises, including the fifth through thirteenth Scooby-Doo direct-to-video animated films, The Jetsons & WWE: Robo-WrestleMania! and the 2017 reboot of Wacky Races.
The first projects greenlit under the studio's new name were a film and a new series based on The Amazing World of Gumball, the latter of which ultimately became the seventh season of the original show and was titled The Wonderfully Weird World of Gumball.
