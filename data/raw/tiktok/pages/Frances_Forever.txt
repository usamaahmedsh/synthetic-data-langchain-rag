== Early life ==

Though the entry was not chosen, Boston's WBUR-FM selected the song as their favorite submission from Massachusetts, calling Garrett's songwriting "reminiscent of the smart bedroom pop of peers like Sidney Gish and Clairo, cheerful-sounding ditties that belie more complicated emotions: sadness, longing, resentment".
