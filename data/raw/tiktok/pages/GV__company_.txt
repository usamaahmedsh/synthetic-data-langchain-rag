GV Management Company, L.L.C. is a venture capital investment arm of Alphabet Inc., founded by Bill Maris, that provides seed, venture, and growth stage funding to technology companies. Founded as Google Ventures in 2010, the firm has operated independently of Google, Alphabet's search and advertising division, since 2015.

== History ==

The group was founded on March 31, 2010, with a $100 million capital commitment, by Bill Maris who also became GV's first CEO. In 2012, that commitment was raised to $300 million annually, and the fund has $2 billion under management. In 2014, the group announced $125 million to invest in promising European startups. By 2014, it had invested in companies such as Shape Security. In December 2015, the company was renamed GV and introduced a new logo.
As of 2016, GV has been less active as a seed investor, instead shifting its attention to more mature companies. There is also a focus on startups in the healthcare markets. It created the biotech company Calico and has invested in Foundation Medicine, Genomics Medicine Ireland, Editas Midicine, and Flatiron Health, among others. In 2020, GV promoted Terri Burns from principal to the firm’s first black female partner. Since 2023, GV has had a focus on investing in AI native startups led by Michael McBride who joined from Gitlab and has invested in startups including Vercel, Lightmatter, Harvey, OpenEvidence, Synthesia and Attio.

In addition, GV provides portfolio companies with access to operational help after making a financial investment. Full-time partners at GV work with portfolio companies on design and product management, marketing, engineering, and recruiting.
