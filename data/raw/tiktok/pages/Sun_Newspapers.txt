Sun Newspapers was formed as a chain of weekly newspapers serving Northeast Ohio. Prior to a major reorganization in 2013, the chain consisted of 11 weekly newspapers serving 49 different communities in Greater Cleveland. The papers are focused on suburbs and exurbs in Cuyahoga,  Geauga, Lorain and Medina counties. Its offices are in Valley View.
Some of the papers in the chain date back, under previous ownership, to the early 20th century, the company was founded as part of SunMedia in 1969. In 1998 it was sold to Advance Publications, part of the S.I. Newhouse media empire, which also publishes The Plain Dealer, the region's major daily.
