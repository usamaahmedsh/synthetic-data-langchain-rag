== Personal life ==
Jessi attended Korea Kent Foreign School along with Girls' Generation members Tiffany Young and Jessica Jung. Jessi successfully passed an SM Entertainment audition, the same company her two classmates were under. However, she chose not to become part of the label, as she believed its approach to music did not match her style. Before Jessi went on temporary hiatus from the music industry, she struggled to become accustomed to Korean culture. She did not find immediate success after her debut, and was sometimes forced to sleep in saunas when she did not have enough money for a place to stay.


== Controversies ==
In May 2013, Jessi was booked in the case of a group assault filed by a Korean-American 'A'. The woman claimed that Jessi and her friends assaulted her in the women's restroom of a club in Itaewon. 'A' initially pressed charges but later dropped them. Jessi later claimed that she only tried to stop the fight but did not participate in the assault. However, 'A' refuted this claim and said that she dropped the charges because she was leaving for the US.
On September 29, 2024, a fan of Jessi reported to the police that he was physically assaulted by someone in Jessi's group after asking for a picture with her. The victim testified that, when he apologized and was about to leave after Jessi declined his request, the perpetrator in her group suddenly struck him in the face. According to the security footage reviewed by the police, flustered Jessi initially attempted to break up the fight by grabbing the perpetrator's arms, but left the scene shortly afterwards with no further intervention. The victim expressed his disappointment in Jessi for just leaving the scene with no effort to resolve the situation.
Jessi later issued an apology to the victim on social media. Explaining that the perpetrator was someone she had just met for the first time on the day of the incident, she apologized for failing to take care of the fan, saying that she was flustered by the sudden situation. Jessi's agency later specified that the assailant was a Chinese man who was an acquaintance of the producer in Jessi's group. It has been reported that the perpetrator has already left South Korea, and that Jessi is now working with her agency to contact the perpetrator. Jessi expressed her deep regret for the fan's injury, and stated that she had a strong moral responsibility to assist in contacting the victim and making the perpetrator face legal consequences. On 16 October 2024, Jessi was summoned to the Gangnam Police Station as a defendant in the case. While she was not directly involved in the alleged assault, she was questioned after being sued by the victim. After a six-hour interrogation, she was released.
