The Hoopers, stylized in all caps, was an all-female Japanese pop group who dress in masculine clothing inspired by Takarazuka Revue. The group was signed to Universal Music Japan. 
The band was formed after twelve of the five thousand participants of Fudanjuku's 'Next Generation Audition' were selected. Seven of the chosen participants went on to form The Hoopers, and the remaining five formed Axell. 
The Hoopers debuted on March 4, 2015, with their single "Itoshi Koishi Kimi Koishi" (イトシコイシ君恋シ). Their eighth member Cecil (who is also an Axell member) was introduced on their single "Passionate Love" as a permanent member. Later in 2015 they held the Ikemen Audition, where they selected 6 people to become members of Little Hoop (they are described as apprentice members for The Hoopers). Lee of AXELL and Noa of Little Hoop joined the group as new members on June 25, 2017, and on July 28, 2017, They released their new single "Shamrock". 
They disbanded on January 25, 2019, with a concert at Kanda Myojin Hall.


== History ==
Japanese idol group Fudanjuku held an audition for juniors. Of the approximately 5,000 participants, 12 were selected as winners, with 7 to form The Hoopers and the remaining 5 to form another group, Axell.
The winners, both those who would become The Hoopers and Axell, appeared as backup dancers on March 30, 2014 for Fudanjuku's performance at Nakano Sunplaza. While this was after they were selected from the audition, they were not introduced to the audience as it was before for official debut. They made their debut on May 2, 2014 when they were unveiled on the internet TV show Ikesuta. They performed their first open-air performance on May 5 in Yoyogi Park.
Universal Sigma released their first single, Itoshi Koishi Kimi Koishi (イトシコイシ君恋シ), on March 4, 2015. In April, the Hoopers hosted two abnormal sponsor programmes that started at the same time to mark one month after their major debut. On July 6, they announced on their official blog that Yuhi would be taking time off from the band due to poor health and that during that time Axell member Cecil would be substituting for her. 
The band announced on September 29, 2015 on their weekly show The Hooper no Harajuku Kyun Kyun Station (THE HOOPERSの原宿キュン♡キュンSTATION) that they would be having their first solo performance, that Yuhi would be making her return to the band at the performance, and that Cecil would officially be joining the band, while also remaining in Axell, bringing the band to 8 members. On October 17, 24, and 31, they visited school festivals in their Hoopers o Oikakete: Kyun Kyun Purojekuto (Sukūru-hen) (HOOPERSを追いかけて〜キュンキュン❤プロジェクト(スクール編)). Their first solo performance was held on November 15 at the live house Niconico-fāre with all 8 members, including Yuhi who had been on leave since July and Cecil who had become an official member after substituting for Yuhi.
On May 4, 2017, Yuhi and Mizuki officially left the group after a leaving ceremony was held for them at a tour finale in Tokyo. At the ceremoney, the other members of the band surprised the two leaving members with a new song, "Life is Beautiful", made for them which they performed to a video accompaniment. On June 24, the Hoopers performed live at Niconico-fāre where they announced their new members, Lee (also a member of Axell) and Noa (formerly of Little Hoop). They released their new single, "Shamrock" on July 28.

On December 6, it was announced on a Showroom stream that there would be a drastic change to the ikemen girls project that is the Hoopers and that their final solo performance would be on January 25, 2019, after which the members would appear in different projects.
