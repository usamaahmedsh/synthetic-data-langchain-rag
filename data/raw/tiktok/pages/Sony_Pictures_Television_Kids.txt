Silvergate Media Limited, trading as Sony Pictures Television – Kids, is a television production and brand licensing company based in New York City and London founded in 2011 by Waheed Alli and William Astor. It is a division of Sony Pictures Television that owns and develops children's programmes and intellectual property.


== History ==
Silvergate Media was created in 2011 as part of a management buyout, when Alli purchased the rights to Octonauts and The World of Beatrix Potter from Chorion, a company he was previously chair of.
In 2013, Silvergate launched its television distribution arm. In 2016, Netflix and Silvergate agreed to a three-year multi-territory deal for Octonauts, Silvergate's series about underwater explorers.
The company signed a deal with Netflix, in collaboration with Mercury Filmworks to produce Hilda, an animated television adaptation of comic Hilda by Luke Pearson. Season 1 was released on September 21, 2018. Season 2 was released on December 14, 2020. The series is available in 130 countries.
Silvergate also produced Sunny Day for Nickelodeon, which started airing on August 21, 2017.
In 2016, the investment fund Shamrock Capital Advisors acquired a 51% equity of the company, with the valuation reported to be "between £70 and £80 million".

On December 10, 2019, Sony Pictures Television announced that it would acquire Silvergate Media for US$195 million. The deal marks SPT's first in-house studio devoted primarily to children's animation since Sony Pictures Animation's diversification into television.
In February 2022, former Disney Junior Senior Vice President of original programming and Sony Pictures Family Entertainment Group executive Joe D'Ambrosia was named Executive Vice President and General Manager of Silvergate Media, succeeding co-founder Waheed Alli, who stepped down as CEO the following summer.
In November 2022, Silvergate Media's trading name was changed to Sony Pictures Television – Kids, although the company name was not changed.
In December 2023, the company's valuation was reduced to US$50 million in impairment charges. In addition, co-founder William Astor stepped down as chairman at the end of the month.
On September 19, 2024, the studio relaunched their "Octonauts & Friends" content hub channel as Kidzuko, which offers content from other Sony-owned properties in addition to properties already held by SPTK as well as entirely new exclusive content.
