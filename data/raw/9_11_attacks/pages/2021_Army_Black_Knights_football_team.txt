The Army Black Knights camouflaged uniform honored the Special Forces Operational Detachment Alphas (ODAs) from the 5th Special Forces Group of Task Force Dagger. In the immediate wake of the 9/11 attacks, ODAs were called upon to rapidly deploy from Fort Campbell, Kentucky to Afghanistan. The uniforms also pay tribute to service members and veterans, marking not only the end of the "Forever War" in Afghanistan, but the 20-year anniversary of 9/11.
