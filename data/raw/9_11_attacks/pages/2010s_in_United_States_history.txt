2010s in United States history is the compiled history of major historical events and issues in the United States from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2019.


== Overview ==
During this time period the United States experienced a wave of unprecedented political polarization and ongoing political debates such as climate change, voting rights, gun control, police misconduct, and immigration. The ongoing 2008 financial crisis dominated the early Obama presidency (2009–2017). Democrats held the majority in both houses of Congress and control of the presidency which enabled Obama to pass numerous landmark legislative pieces such as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, Dodd-Frank, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and the Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2011. Economic inequality and lack of accountability stemming from the financial crisis led to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement which quickly expanded into hundreds of American cities. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act generated both national support and backlash around the administration's effort to expand the federal government's role in healthcare. The United States Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. FEC that laws restricting campaign finance donations were unconstitutional leading to a nationwide argument and scholastic research on campaign finance reform and the impact corporations have in American democracy. Conservative opposition such as the Tea Party Movement coalesced and won the 2010 midterm elections in a landslide. Obama's approval ratings fluctuated prior to the 2012 presidential election due to factors such as the economy and opposition to Obamacare. The Obama administration recovered and won widespread public praise following the assassination of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and a strong, co-ordinated response to Hurricane Sandy. Congress stalled on the administration's immigration reform agenda, prompting Obama to sign an executive order establishing the DACA program. Prior to the election, the administration was scrutinized for its response to the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks in which sitting US ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was assassinated.
Barack Obama was re-elected in the 2012 presidential election becoming the first African American president to secure two terms. The second term of the Obama administration saw historic congressional gridlock and tension between the Democratic administration and the Republican controlled Congress. Following a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, a nationwide debate about gun legislation reopened which saw the Obama administration aggressively lobby for gun control. These legislative proposals died in Congress leading to the expansion and emphasis on local community organizing instead. During Obama's second term issues such as climate change emerged in the public consciousness, leading the administration to adopt clean power directives and sign the Paris Climate Accord. Also during this time, the United States began to change its attitudes towards gay rights. Following the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the nationwide movement to legalize gay marriage began to see significant gains and public acceptance. In 2015 the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that restrictions to gay marriage were deemed unconstitutional and gay marriage became legal. A series of allegations of police misconduct and the shooting of Michael Brown prompted the Obama Administration to investigate the Ferguson Police Department. Michael Brown's death coupled with the shooting of Trayvon Martin kickstarted the Black Lives Matter Movement and a national conversation about the relationship police have with African Americans. Racism remained a central issue in 2015 which saw an armed gunman massacre nine African Americans in the historic Mother Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. One of the victims was South Carolina state senator Clementa C. Pinckney, a senior pastor of the church. The racial motivations of the shooting pressured South Carolina governor Nikki Haley to remove the Confederate Flag from the South Carolina State House. The final year of the Obama presidency was marked by bitterness between the administration and Congress. Following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Obama appointed Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. The political division coupled with the lame-duck president played a role in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's decision to forgo any action on behalf of the Senate to vet Garland. This decision ignited a political firestorm as both sides doubled down on their decision leading to a debate on potential unconstitutional misconduct by McConnell.  Garland's nomination was ultimately ignored and the seat was filled by Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee. Islamic terrorism became a major issue in US political discourse following the 2015 Paris attacks leading to an increase in American military invention alongside European allies overseas. During the Obama administration, major technological advancements converged to create military drones, which are the subject of an ongoing debate about the ethical use of this technology.
On June 16, 2015 businessman and former reality TV star Donald Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States. Trump made media headlines for his controversial conduct and behavior, garnering both support and criticism. Trump became renowned for this unorthodox approach with some analysts concluding that it was ultimately helpful to the Trump campaign as he received over $2 billion in free media coverage. Trump emerged as the Republican front-runner by June 2016, receiving the nomination in July. Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary of State, US Senator, and First Lady declared her candidacy in April 2015 and became the front-runner. Clinton clashed with Senator Bernie Sanders, opening a divide in the Democratic party between the centrists and progressive faction of which Sanders' held the bulk of his support. Clinton successfully outmaneuvered Sanders and won the Democratic nominee, becoming the first woman in US history to be a presidential nominee for either major US party. Social media played an unprecedented role in the outcome of the election as voter behavior was impacted by what they saw on social media. Voters on both sides were bombarded with social media misinformation and fake news. One such source of misinformation was the Russian government which flooded platforms, especially Facebook with fake news and content designed to invoke an emotional response. Both candidates were extremely disliked and were the most unpopular in modern American history. The Trump campaign heavily invested in Facebook and used the platform to contain the outrage following the release of the Access Hollywood tape. In summer 2016, the Democratic National Committee was hacked and internal emails were released on the website WikiLeaks. The leaked emails gave rise to a right-wing conspiracy theory, Pizzagate that dominated online political discourse. Political polarization accelerated dramatically in the months leading up to the election. Most pollsters concluded that Hillary Clinton would ultimately defeat Trump but differed by the margin of victory.
Despite losing the popular vote, Donald Trump won the election in one of the most stunning upsets in American history. Following Trump's inauguration, a series of protests commenced around the world. In his first 100 days, Trump signed a series of executive orders that reduced government's support the Affordable Care Act, expanded infrastructure projects, and instituted an entry ban on foreign nationals from seven Muslim majority countries. Trump authorized a missile strike in Syria in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. Trump's first 100 days received an unprecedented amount of media coverage, the majority of such coverage was negative leading to a nationwide debate on media bias. Following Trump's inauguration, the US intelligence community definitively concluded that the Russian government had interfered in the presidential election. In May 2017, Deputy United States Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as Special Counsel to investigate the extent of the Russian interference and whether or not the Trump campaign was involved. The special counsel investigation loomed over the majority of Trump's presidency. Some of Trump's close associates such as Paul Manafort were investigated and charged by the special counsel's office.  On August 11, alt-right groups consisting of neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates, white nationalists, Klansmen, & other far-right militias gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue. The event called Unite the Right, descended into violence, and the following day saw a white supremacist drive a vehicle into a crowd of counter-protestors killing one and injuring thirty-five. President Trump's response to the attack garnered widespread controversy. His remarks such as, "very fine people on both sides," were met with condemnation. Trump was further criticized for his administration's response to Hurricane Maria. 2018 saw Trump pivot US foreign policy and began rapprochement with North Korea. His visit with North Korea was overshadowed by the unfolding sex scandal involving pornstar Stormy Daniels.

The Senate had a Democratic majority, but the House had a Republican majority. Harry Reid (D-NV) was Senate Majority Leader and John Boehner (R-OH) was Speaker of the House. The 113th was one of the least productive in history, notable for brinkmanship (shutting down the government for 16 days in 2013 and almost shutting it down again in 2014). According to Gallup, only 15% of Americans approved of the Congress' work, only 1% more than the all-time low of the 112th Congress.

When Speaker Ryan refused to allow debate on gun legislation, 60 Democratic House Members staged a 2016 United States House of Representatives sit-in but failed to force a vote. In the Senate, Chris Murphy (D-CT), successfully launched a 15-hour filibuster that led to two votes on gun control, barring guns from suspected terrorists and expanding background checks on gun purchasers. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) blamed "Republicans who take their marching orders from the National Rifle Association" for the defeat of both bills. In March 2016 Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland, 63, to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Antonin Scalia, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold hearings or bring the nomination up for a vote.

=== Recession of 2008 ===

The Great Recession was a severe financial crisis from December 2007 to June 2009 that began when the U.S. housing market crashed, and large amounts of mortgage-backed securities and derivatives lost significant value. The United States lost 8.7 million jobs and U.S. households lost $19 trillion of net worth.
The Obama administration spent much of its time and effort into improving the economy and addressing the issues that led to the recession. Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act on July 21, 2010, to give the government expanded regulatory power over the financial sector. Real GDP regained its pre-recession peak in the second quarter of 2011, and in March 2013, the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke its 2007 high. Workers and households did less well. The unemployment rate was at 5% at the end of 2007, reached 10% in October 2009, and did not recover to 5% until 2015. Household income in the United States did not surpass its pre-recession level until 2016.
