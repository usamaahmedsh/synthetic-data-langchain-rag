==== "Visionary Fiction" ====
Imarisha (together with Octavia's Brood co-editor Adrienne Maree Brown) describes her genre of fiction as "visionary fiction":

We believe that radical science fiction is actually better termed visionary fiction because it pulls from real life experience, inequalities and movement building to create innovative ways of understanding the world around us, paint visions of new worlds that could be, and teach us new ways of interacting with one another. Visionary fiction engages our imaginations and hearts, and guides our hands as organizers."


=== Teaching ===
Walidah has taught in Stanford University's Program of Writing and Rhetoric, Pacific Northwest College of the Arts' Master's in Critical Studies Program, Portland State University's Black Studies Department, Oregon State University's Women Gender Sexuality Studies Department, and Southern New Hampshire University's English Department. She presented all over Oregon as a public scholar with Oregon Humanities' Conversation Project for six years on topics such as Oregon Black history, alternatives to incarceration, and the history of hip hop.


=== Organizing ===
Walidah spent six years on the board of the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, and helped to found the Human Rights Coalition, a group of prisoners' families and former prisoners with three chapters in Pennsylvania.
