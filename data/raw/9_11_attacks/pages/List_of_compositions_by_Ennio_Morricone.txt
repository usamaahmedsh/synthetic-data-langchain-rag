This is a list of compositions by composer, orchestrator and conductor Ennio Morricone. He composed and arranged scores for more than 400 film and television productions. Morricone was considered one of the most influential and best-selling film composers since the late 1940s.
He has sold well over 70 million records worldwide, including 6.5 million albums and singles in France, over three million in the United States and more than two million albums in Korea.
In 1971, the composer received his first golden record (disco d'oro) for the sale of 1,000,000 records in Italy and a "Targa d'Oro" for the worldwide sales of 22 million.
His score for Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the top 5 best-selling original instrumental scores in the world today, with about 10 million copies sold.
His score for The Mission (1986) was also at one point the world's best selling score. Morricone's music for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and Le Professionnel (1981) each sold over 3 million copies worldwide.
