Shrek Retold is a fan-made reanimated collab film based on the 2001 film Shrek, in turn based on the 1990 children’s book by William Steig. Released on November 29, 2018, to YouTube, the project was led by YouTuber Grant Duffrin ("3GI", best known for hosting an annual Shrek festival in Milwaukee from 2014 to 2023).
It features the work of over 200 creators, each contributing to a portion of the recreation.


== Plot ==


== Format ==
As a recreation, Shrek Retold follows the plot of the original film with only some deviations. The main difference between Shrek Retold and the original is in its reinterpretation; as a collaborative effort with over 200 contributors, the art style, voice acting, and music change from scene to scene, often being wildly different from the original. Unlike the original Shrek which is entirely 3D animated, Shrek Retold features 2D and 3D animation, live action, stop-motion, and other mediums. The film's contributors include many internet personalities and actors, such as David Liebe Hart, Michael Cusack, Anthony Fantano, Jamie Loftus and SiIvaGunner.


== Production and release ==

Shrek Retold was produced as collaborative, but segmented effort; director Grant Duffrin split the film into different scenes of varying length, and each scene was recreated by a contributor. In an interview with Quartz, Duffrin stated his love of Shrek was genuine, contrary to the "ironic" Shrek internet memes of the time. Shortly prior to release, a trailer for the film was uploaded to the 3GI channel which received significant news coverage. The film premiered on YouTube to a live audience on November 29, 2018, and has since remained on the site. On November 29, 2019, it was announced that the film would be available for purchase on a film poster, VHS and as a free digital download. A Blu-ray release was later announced on March 1, 2022.


== Reception ==
Shrek Retold was received well by critics, who mainly praised its impressive scope for a fan project and its bizarre content.


== Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack was released on streaming services and cassette for the film's first anniversary on November 29, 2019. It features covers of songs featured in the original Shrek's soundtrack and additional original songs written specifically for the project.


== Sequels ==
Originally, on April 1, 2019, 3GI posted an April Fools video titled Shrek 2 Retold in which the project director discussed the creation of Shrek Retold. During Shrekfest 2019, it was announced that Shrek 2 Retold was no longer just a joke and is actually happening via an animated announcement trailer. On April 22, 2021, as a celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the original film, 3GI posted an official teaser trailer of Shrek 2 Retold. The film premiered at the tenth Shrekfest via an in-person screening at the Oriental Theatre on September 3, 2023. A trailer was released on May 19, 2024, announcing the film will be released on September 28 of that year, as well as announcing a number of contributors, including Justin Long, Zach Hadel, Lucas Cruikshank, Tay Zonday,  Justin & Travis McElroy, Jake and Amir, Joe Pera, Jaiden Animations, Richard Steven Horvitz, Matt Bennett, Noah Munck, Dax Flame, jacksfilms, Tom Fulp, James Rolfe, LAKE, Steve Zaragoza, Shoenice, Mega64, Jerma985, Bill Wurtz, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, and posthumous appearances from Gilbert Gottfried and Will Cullen Hart. On September 20, 2024, the film was delayed indefinitely.
In March 2020, Shrek Retold was followed up by Sonic Rebuilt, a similar recreation of the 1999 Sonic the Hedgehog film. Unlike Shrek Retold, Sonic Rebuilt uses the soundtrack from its source OVA.
