== Premise ==
Part Timers centers around the antics of the part-time employees of Pork E. Pine's, a run-down children's pizzeria and arcade, and is loosely based on Hecox's own experiences working at Chuck E. Cheese, prior to his YouTube fame. The series features Smosh as Pork E. Pine's hapless manager Anton (Padilla), who got the position with the help of his father despite his obvious lack of experience in the job, and his friend Ian (Hecox), the Pork E. Pine mascot. Also featured are Pete (Noah Grossman), a socially inept recent hire who harbours feelings for his somewhat neurotic colleague, Mads (Cat Alter), who works on the cleanup crew; Dinger (Casey Webb), an eccentric comic book nerd who mans the arcade prize booth; Lori (Natalie Whittle), the restaurant supervisor and the only level-headed member of staff; and Ella (Jade Martz), a ditzy, overly friendly employee with financial problems.
