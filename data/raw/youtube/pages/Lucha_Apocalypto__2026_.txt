== Production ==


=== Background ===
Lucha Apocalypto is a reoccurring professional wrestling supercard event produced by MLW and CMLL that was first held on November 9, 2024. The first event would air live on November 9, 2024, but the stream was postponed to November 10, 2024, due to technical issues and was aired on tape delay on MLW's YouTube channel.
On May 8, 2025, MLW announced that Lucha Apocalypto would take place on November 15, 2025, at the Cicero Stadium in Cicero, Illinois. This will be the second consecutive Lucha Apocalypto held at the venue, following 2025. On August 15, 2025, MLW announced that Lucha Apocalypto would be rescheduled to February 7, 2026.


=== Storylines ===
The card consisted of matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out at MLW events, and across the league's social media platforms.
