== History ==
Jackson Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 6, 1844, from portions of Dover Township (now Toms River Township), Freehold Township and Upper Freehold Township, while the area was still part of Monmouth County. The township was named for president Andrew Jackson, a year before his death. It became part of the newly created Ocean County on February 15, 1850. Portions of the township were taken to form Plumsted Township on March 11, 1845.
The surnames of the first 25 families who settled in this town were  Allen, Applegate, Benit (Bennett), Bills, Burdon (Borden) - a 1665 patentee, Buckelew, Cheeseman - a 1665 patentee, Henderson, Holman - a 1665 patentee, Hulse, Hyerse (Heyers), Johnstone, and Johnson, Perrino, Reynolds, Van Hise, and White.
Starting around 1920, the cranberry and other agricultural industries started to grow. It would remain like this until 1955 when the federal government terminated its subsidizing of chicken grain.
Starting with an average of 100 new homes per year in the late 1950s, new homes built per year in the 1960s increased to an average of 750. And the 1970s to 1980s to more than a thousand units per year. From 1961 to 1966, 3,000 new children enrolled in the local elementary schools, and despite the recession of 1989-90, however this trend still continued.

On July 1, 1974, under the direction of New York based entrepreneur Warner LeRoy, Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park opened in Jackson Township. It first opened to the public as simply Great Adventure in 1974, it was later acquired by the larger Six Flags brand in 1977. To accommodate for the rise in tourism in the township, in 1997 Simon Property Group opened Jackson Premium Outlets, an open-air outlet power center.
Adventure Crossing opened in January 2023, located between Jackson Premium Outlets and Six Flags Great Adventure. The mixed-use complex features fast-food restaurants, a gas station and a family entertainment complex (with a 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) sports bubble that has 42 Top Golf bays, axe throwing, virtual reality rides, and additional restaurants and bars). When completed, the complex will also have a surf pool, turf fields, luxury apartments, Hilton hotels, conference centers, a medical arts facility and other mixed-use amenities for business, lifestyle, healthcare, and leisure.
On April 1, 2023, two separate tornadoes rated EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale struck Jackson Township, with winds of up to 120 miles per hour (190 km/h). The first tornado struck western sections of the township near County Route 537 (Monmouth Road), inflicting significant damage to the Adventure Crossing USA mixed-use complex (causing the 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) sports bubble to actually collapse), a newly built warehouse development and several homes. The second tornado struck near the border with neighboring Howell Township near the Aldrich Road area. The National Weather Service confirmed that the path of the tornado was 50 yards (46 m) wide and 1.4 miles (2.3 km) long. Both of these tornadoes were some of the strongest recorded to have hit the state and were part of four separate powerful tornadoes that had impacted the state in the outbreak.

=== Orthodox Jewish community ===
Since 2016, the Orthodox Jewish population has been growing in central and eastern Jackson Township, along the border with Lakewood Township, due to the more affordable housing and quieter lifestyle that Jackson Township offers over Lakewood. By 2020, the Orthodox Jewish community had grown to approximately 500 families, out of 19,400 total households, from a limited presence just a few years prior.
A series of pending lawsuits allege that Jackson Township has passed multiple ordinances trying to stymie movement from Lakewood to Jackson. A "no knock" ordinance had been passed by Jackson prohibiting door-to-door solicitation after residents complained of an increase in real estate solicitations. Ordinances were passed that were restrictive to the Orthodox Jewish lifestyle; efforts to open yeshivas in the township, often accompanied by dormitories, were blocked by newly adopted ordinances that restricted new schools and prohibited dormitories. Eruvs (symbolic religious enclosures) were determined not to meet building and construction codes after a new ordinance was passed that tightened restrictions on items placed in the public "right-of-way". To address this last concern, the township entered into a preliminary settlement allowing eruvs in some parts of township and proposed a township-wide solution that was ultimately deemed impractical.
In addition, the United States Department of Justice and the New Jersey Attorney General have opened investigations into whether the township practiced anti-Semitic discrimination, filing multiple subpoenas against township officials. These investigations culminated in May 2020 with a federal lawsuit brought by the Department of Justice against the township, alleging violations of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the Fair Housing Act related to the township's new land use laws.
