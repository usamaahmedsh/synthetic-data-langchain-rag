== Early life ==
From her fourth year in elementary school to her third year in middle school, Hasegawa played baseball on a co-ed team, in which she served as second baseman.

=== Music career ===

Hasegawa auditioned for AKB48's then-upcoming Niigata-based sister group, NGT48, having been fascinated with idols after she watched AKB0048. After passing the audition for the group's first generation on July 25, 2015, at the opening show of NGT48's theater on January 10, 2016, she debuted as a regular member of the newly established Team NIII. As part of NGT48, she subsequently made her major label debut on April 12, 2017, with the single "Seishun Dokei." In 2018, Hasegawa appeared in the live-action film adaptation of the novel Midnight Bus. She was later transferred to the group's newly established Team G. She also participated in the South Korean reality competition series, Produce 48, representing NGT48 with Team NIII's Yamada Noe. Hasegawa was eliminated during the first round and finished at 71st place.
In 2019, after Team G co-captain Yamaguchi Maho was forced by the NGT48 management to apologize for publicly alleging that she was assaulted in December 2018, Hasegawa removed "NGT48" off her social media profiles to show support. The NGT48 management responded by merging Team NIII and Team G together into a "first generation" group, with their final performances as their original teams on April 21, 2019. During Team G's performance on April 21, Hasegawa, along with Sugahara Riko, announced her decision to graduate from NGT48 in solidarity with Yamaguchi. Hasegawa held a final performance with Yamaguchi and Sugahara on May 18, 2019.
