Match Not Found is a British romantic comedy web series set entirely on Skype created and written by actress Katie Sheridan and British playwright Alex Oates.


== Format ==
The story is told in vlog-style by Kat with her friends entering the conversation via Skype call and adding to the story.


== Plot ==
This modern romcom follows the story of Kat (Katie Sheridan), who is on an eventful quest for the right man. Feeling fragile after an unexpected breakup, she is now on the rebound with the help of her friends, the vivacious Janna (Kristy J Curtis) and the no nonsense computer programmer Doug (Connor Mills). As the trio hurtle from one dating disaster to the next, it is clear that Kat's friends are no experts in love either.
Over various episodes the characters explore themes of love online and what it is to be single in your twenties in a world moving increasingly on to the internet.
