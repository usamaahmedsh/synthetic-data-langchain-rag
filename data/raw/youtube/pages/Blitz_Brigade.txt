Blitz Brigade was a multiplayer first-person shooter video game based on World War II developed and published by Gameloft for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. It shut down their servers in December 2023.


== Gameplay ==
Blitz Brigade is an online team-based first-person shooter, with two "campaign" modes—multiplayer and training. The players could play as part of either Allies or Axis team. Training mode is an online single-player mode that consisted of 120 unlockable training missions. Multiplayer mode offered deathmatch and domination (capture) across 5 levels. A later update added a capture the flag mode. The players could play as one of 6 (originally, 5) unlockable classes. The game featured two in-game currencies and new weapons could be purchased.

Jon Mundy of Pocket Gamer noted the framework for and excellent online FPS but criticized its freemium aspect and online stability. Andrew Stevens of 148Apps described the gameplay as fun and smooth, but lacking content.
