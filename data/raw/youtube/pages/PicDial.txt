PicDial was a mobile service created by IQzone Inc. and based in Scottsdale, Arizona, United States.  PicDial provides users with the ability to automatically see their friends' Facebook and MySpace profile pictures and status messages as Full Screen Caller ID on their mobile phone.  The software automatically keeps contacts social networking information current, allowing the most recent profile pictures and status messages to be displayed on incoming and outgoing calls or texts.  The PicDial application provides users with a "Favorites Screen," a visual grid that allows users to call or text by selecting a friends social networking profile picture.  This Mobile social address book platform allows users to link multiple social networks.  The application also enables users to determine which picture will display when a call or text is made to a PicDial friend, giving the user control over the picture seen by friends. This defined picture can either be taken from the users camera on the phone, or pulled from their profile pictures on Facebook or MySpace.  When a user changes their picture (and status message), this new image will be updated to their friends' phones.
The service also backs up contacts that reside on the mobile phone.  If the phone is lost or stolen, PicDial subscribers have the capability to retrieve contact information.
PicDial is available for download on all the major US mobile networks, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint Nextel, T Mobile, Boost Mobile, Cellular South, and U.S. Cellular.  The software is compatible with BlackBerry, iPhone, Java, Android, Symbian and Windows Mobile devices.  It can be downloaded from various off deck sites, including Android Market, BlackBerry World, Apple Inc.'s App Store, and GetJar. Additionally, PicDial has been pre-loaded on a number of AT&T devices, including the Samsung Eternity II and Samsung Flight II.
