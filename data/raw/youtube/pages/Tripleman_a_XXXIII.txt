=== Background ===

2025 marked the 33rd year that the Mexican professional wrestling company Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (Triple A or AAA) will hold their annual flagship Triplemanía show. Triplemanía is the company's biggest show of the year, the AAA equivalent of WWE's WrestleMania or New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom event. Triplemanía XXXIII will be the 47th overall Triplemanía show promoted by AAA (AAA promoted multiple Triplemanía shows over the summers of 1994 to 1997). Since the 2012 event, Triplemanía has taken place at the Arena Ciudad de México (Mexico City Arena), an indoor arena in Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, Mexico that has a maximum capacity of 22,300 spectators. On February 11, 2025, AAA announced that Triplemanía XXXIII would be held on August 16, 2025. It will be also the first Triplemanía event after WWE's deal to acquire AAA, as part of a joint venture with Mexican sports and entertainment company Fillip, closed on August 1, 2025.
On July 26, WWE's Chief Content Officer Paul "Triple H" Levesque announced that the event would stream live on YouTube.


=== Storylines ===
Triplemanía XXXIII featured seven professional wrestling matches, with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Results were predetermined by AAA's booking team and WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on AAA events and on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw, Friday Night SmackDown, and NXT.
After winning the AAA Mega Championship at Triplemanía Regia III, El Hijo del Vikingo appeared at the AAA Alianzas event on July 25 addressing the crowd before being interrupted by Dragon Lee and El Grande Americano, with Americano hurling insults until both Lee and Vikingo removed him from the ring. Later, a masked figure would attack both men before revealing himself as Dominik Mysterio, who then spoke to the audience in Spanish and walked out with the title. AAA later made the four-way match for the AAA Mega Championship between the wrestlers official for Triplemanía XXXIII.
On August 6, on a video released via WWE's social media channels, The Judgment Day (Finn Balor, JD McDonagh, and Raquel Rodriguez) issued a challenge to Mr. Iguana, Niño Hamburguesa, and NXT's Lola Vice for a mixed trios match at Triplemanía XXXIII; the match was later made official by WWE.
