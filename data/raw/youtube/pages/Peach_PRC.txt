Sharlee Jade "Shaylee" Curnow (born 2 April 1997), known professionally as Peach PRC, is an Australian pop singer, songwriter, and social media personality. Her major label debut single "Josh" was released in early 2021, which peaked at number 38 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Peach is a prominent figure on the social media platform TikTok, where she posts content about her life, living with borderline personality disorder, self-care advice, overcoming addiction, and her music.


== Early life ==
Curnow was born on 2 April 1997 in Australia. She grew up in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. She chose her stage name due to her love of the colour pink, as an homage to Princess Peach, using the title during her time performing as a stripper.
She began using the suffix PRC on TikTok as an abbreviation for porcelain because she deemed the full word too long to type out.
In an interview with Echo Magazine, Curnow said: "I've been interested in music for as long as I could talk, really. I've always sang and wrote songs and even have songs written from when I was like 8 years old."


== Career ==


=== 2019–2020: "Blondes" and TikTok popularity ===
On 19 June 2019, Peach independently released her debut single "Blondes". She created a TikTok account in September 2019, subsequently attracting an audience after posting content about her life, self-care advice, and her music. Her second single "Colourblind" was released on 2 May 2020. She said that the inspiration for the song "came from [her] synaesthesia and mine happens to be with colours and music; so I wanted to write a song that involved the colours I saw when singing it."


=== 2021–2024: "Josh", Republic Records signing and debut EP ===
On 21 February 2021, The Music Network confirmed Peach had signed with Island Records in Australia and Republic Records in the US. Her debut major label single "Josh" was released on 26 February 2021. Discussing the song, she said: "It's very special to me, because it captured a real moment. I was a bit down when I was writing one day. My ex, Josh, kept calling me over and over again. He called all of the time, because he was trying to get back with me. I thought I had blocked him though. Since he didn't stop bothering me, I wrote the song about him. It's a true story, but it's meant to be fun and colourful." The song debuted at number 38 on the ARIA Singles Chart. On 25 June, Peach released the single "Symptomatic". On 22 October, Peach released the two-track single "I've Been Bad, Santa" / "Christmas Kinda Sucks". On 5 November, Curnow released the single "Heavy". On 10 January 2022, Curnow leaked a song on her TikTok called "God Is a Freak," without telling her label. The snippet went viral and after fan demand, the song was released on 4 February 2022.
On 3 February 2023, Peach announced her debut extended play, Manic Dream Pixie, which was released on 28 April 2023. Peach's EP entered the ARIA Albums Chart at number 1 on 5 May 2023.
The compilation Chapter 1: Singles Collection was released in November 2024.

In July 2025, Peach released the single "Sweet n Low". In November 2025, Peach released "Miss Erotica".


== Personal life ==
Curnow came out as a lesbian on 13 January 2022. She had previously identified as bisexual. On 9 February 2021, she was featured on Abbie Chatfield's It's a Lot podcast, where she discussed coming to terms with her sexuality, stating; "every gay person I knew, or bi person, was like 'yeah I always knew. I've known it since I was little.' I don't remember knowing from a young age that I liked girls."
In April 2022, Curnow revealed her birth name was Sharlee, as opposed to Shaylee, after her birth name was used on an APRA Music Awards poster shared on her Instagram. Commenters were quick to point out what they believed was a typo on the poster; however, Curnow replied to clear up the confusion and revealed it was the name on her birth certificate. Despite this, she continues to go by Shaylee in her personal life and is also credited professionally as Shaylee Curnow.
Curnow has been open about her battles with addiction in her TikTok videos, as well as her experiences with borderline personality disorder and ADHD, including hyperfixation.


=== Relationship with Alex Williamson ===
On 28 April 2021, Curnow made a post on social media, alleging abusive and predatory behaviour by her former boyfriend, Australian comedian Alex "Shooter" Williamson. Williamson responded in a series of stories on Instagram, claiming the allegations were "horse shit" and accusing PRC of domestic violence, recounting an incident in which she allegedly tried to kick down a door while he was on the toilet. Williamson was subsequently dropped by his management a day later, and the lineup of the Perth and Sydney comedy festivals on 3 May. Williamson has rebuked all claims. Following the allegations against him, Instagram removed Williamson's profile. Williamson claimed this was the second time Curnow had attempted to "deplatform" him, after which she removed the posts.
