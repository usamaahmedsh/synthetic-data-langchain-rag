== Production ==


=== Background ===
On June 15, 2024, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), on their official Twitter account, announced that their 91st annual anniversary show would take place at Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico on Friday September 13, 2024 as part of Mexican independence day weekend, a major weekend for Mexican combat sports. The 2024 Mexican independence day is notable for being the first to host major Mexican-themed lucha libre (CMLL 91st Anniversary Show), boxing (Canelo Álvarez vs. Edgar Berlanga), and mixed martial arts (Riyadh Season Noche UFC) events on the same weekend.


=== Storylines ===
The event featured seven professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes (tecnicos), villains (rudos), or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines were produced on CMLL's weekly Friday night show Super Viernes and on other CMLL events.
