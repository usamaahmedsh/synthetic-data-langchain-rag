On April 15, 2025, Gura announced her graduation from Hololive effective May 1, using terminology from the Japanese idol industry to refer to retirement, as is common among VTubers. Her final activity on that date consisted of multiple streams with her fellow Hololive Myth members playing games such as Minecraft, The Jackbox Party Pack, Gang Beasts, and Uno, concluding in a short 3D "mini live" concert, during which she performed a medley of her officially released original songs, followed by a short animation.


== Popularity ==

On September 9, 2020, Gura posted her first tweet with the word "a". On September 13, her first live broadcast was delayed and her first word was "a" ([æ]). Later, the broadcast was interrupted due to equipment problems, leaving tens of thousands of users typing "a" in the chat room, waiting for the broadcast to resume. "a" quickly became an internet meme. This, combined with the overall popular surge of VTubers (and virtual reality in general) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, likely contributed to Gura's fast success. Only forty days after her debut, she had reached one million subscribers, becoming the first Hololive VTuber to do so.
