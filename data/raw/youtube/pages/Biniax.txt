Biniax is a series of free and open-source puzzle video games first released on April 17, 2005. The games Biniax, Biniax 2 and BiniaxMobile are licensed under the zlib license. The first two are coded in C, and the mobile version is in Java ME.


== Gameplay ==

The game is played on a 7 by 24 grid, which contains empty spaces or pairs of colored elements. There are four colors to choose from: blue, green, red, and yellow, with each pair composed of elements of different colors. 
At the start of the game, the player is given one element that they can move to any empty space within the grid.
Pairs of elements matching the player's given element can be selected for removal from the grid. Following a removal, the player is then given a new paired element. Each removal adds to the player's score. 
Over time, the field moves downwards, and the game concludes when the player exhausts all available moves, rendering further progress impossible.
