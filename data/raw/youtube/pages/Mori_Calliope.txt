== Career ==
Mori Calliope made her debut along with the other members of Hololive English Myth on 12 September 2020. Her debut EP, Dead Beats, was released on 17 October 2020 and charted at #23 at the Oricon Digital Albums Chart. She released her first single "Cursed Night" on 2 November 2020. This was followed on 4 April 2021 with another EP, Your Mori.; it charted at #35 at the Oricon Albums Chart.
In April 2022, Mori announced that she had signed with EMI Records, and that she would mark her major-label debut with her third EP, Shinigami Note. Released on 20 July 2022, Shinigami Note charted at #9 at the Oricon Albums Chart. On 21 July 2022, Mori's first solo concert, New Underworld Order, was held at Toyosu Pit in Tokyo. A Blu-ray of the concert was released on 3 May 2023.  On 11 October 2022, it was announced that she would release her debut album Sinderella on 16 December; the album's themes include the seven deadly sins and personal guilt. It charted at #28 at the Oricon Albums Chart. In July 2023, she released "Future Island", a song commemorating Volume 106 of One Piece.  On 18 August 2023, she released another EP, Jigoku 6; it charted at #16 on the Oricon Albums Chart. In December 2023, she won Best Music Vtuber at the 2023 Vtuber Awards.
In March 2024, Mori and Warner Bros. announced that she would be singing the ending theme for the anime Suicide Squad Isekai, titled "Go-Getters".  In May 2024, it was announced that she would release her second major-label album, Phantomime, on 16 August. In October 2025, Mori announced that she would perform the second opening theme in Gachiakuta, titled "Let's Just Crash". In November 2025, it was announced that Mori would release her third major-label album, Disasterpiece, on 6 February 2026.
In addition to music, Mori does video game livestreams on her channel. In a December 2020 livestream, she spent at least 90 minutes asking video game developer Atlus to allow her to stream one of their games, Persona 3 (there is no fair use doctrine in Japanese copyright law, so VTubers often request permission from developers to livestream their games), which Petrit Baillet of Dot Esports described as "a famous part of her ongoing streaming career". In June 2022, she expressed regret, admitting she hadn't realized how big Hololive had become at the time of the stream. In January 2023, she livestreamed Persona 3 on her YouTube channel for the first time.
In September 2021, she appeared at Calgary Expo and Fan Expo Dallas as part of Hololive English's North American tour. She has also appeared at Anime Festival Asia as a musical guest twice: in 2022 and 2023. In November 2023, she appeared at Anime NYC 2023 as a guest. In December 2023, she appeared at Anime Frontier 2023 as a guest.


== Artistry ==
Katie Gill of Anime Feminist described her profanity-laden rap music as an exception to the widespread use of Japanese idol themes within Hololive. Teddy Cambosa of Anime Corner said that her "style of rapping comes in line with the rise of other large VTubers that are now leaning towards a more Western preference instead of the Japanese idol grassroots".
In an August 2022 Crunchyroll News interview, when asked which music was the most influential to her, Mori explained that her interest in rapping was first sparked by Japanese hip hop, citing the genre's unique style and intensity. She also cites the electro-swing duo Fake Type as her inspiration for her rapping career.
