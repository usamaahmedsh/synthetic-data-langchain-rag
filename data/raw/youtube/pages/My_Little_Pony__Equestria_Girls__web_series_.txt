My Little Pony: Equestria Girls is an animated web series based on Hasbro's toyline and media franchise of the same name, itself being a spin-off of the 2010 relaunch of Hasbro's My Little Pony toyline. It refocuses on the main characters from the television series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, re-envisioned as human teenagers attending high school. The series premiered on November 17, 2017, on YouTube. The first season was marketed with the theme "Better Together".
The series ended its run following its second season on June 23, 2020, after DHX Media Vancouver (now operating under its current name, WildBrain) had left its production in 2019.


== Production and release ==
This series marks the debut of a new wardrobe for the main characters. The girls' new clothing were designed by celebrity fashion stylist Laura Schuffman.

In January 2020, YouTube amended its policies regarding child-oriented videos, after the service was fined by the United States Federal Trade Commission for violating Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in September 2019. Under the revised policies, the operators of a YouTube channel need to mark a child-oriented video (or entire channel aimed at children) as such; the marked videos are restricted from utilizing certain functions of YouTube, including on-screen interactivity. The "You Choose the Ending" interactive shorts as uploaded on YouTube were affected by the change.
In March 2021, writer and story editor Nick Confalone revealed that the writing staff had plans for a third season as well as an official ending for the series, but Hasbro was uninterested.
