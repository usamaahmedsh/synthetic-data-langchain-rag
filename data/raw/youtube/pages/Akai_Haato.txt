Akai Haato (赤井はあと), also known as Haachama (はあちゃま), is a Japanese virtual YouTuber (VTuber) affiliated with Hololive Production. She is part of Hololive (Japan) 1st Generation alongside Natsuiro Matsuri, Shirakami Fubuki, and Aki Rosenthal.


== Overview ==
From 2 May to 13 May 2018, Cover, the management company of Hololive, held a VTuber audition to find individuals with experience in live streaming and video uploading who wanted to challenge themselves as VTubers. The character designs and names of the five open spots that would later debut as Generation 1 were made public at the start of the audition. Artist Haruyuki Nijyou illustrated the design of Haato, and a 3D model was later created by Pompu Chou.
Haato's Twitter account was opened on 21 May 2018, while her YouTube channel was created on 24 May. She made her debut stream on 2 June 2018.


== Activity ==
Haato began her livestreaming activities in June 2018. Her livestreams mainly consist of chatting, gaming, and singing. Outside of livestreaming, Haato uploads short comedy skits, memes, and cooking videos on her YouTube channel. Haato studied in Australia and briefly in the Philippines until December 2020. As a result, she is one of the few Hololive members who can speak English.
On 27 September 2020, Haato, alongside Hololive (Japan) 4th Generation member Kiryu Coco, were suspended from all livestreaming and Twitter activities for three weeks following controversy when the two displayed Taiwan as a sovereign state while disclosing their YouTube channel's analytics, which sparked criticism from their Mainland Chinese audience. Haato returned to her activities on 19 October.
On 10 February 2021, Haato's YouTube channel surpassed 1 million subscribers, the 8th Hololive member to do so.
