Eitaa Messenger (Persian: پیام‌رسان ایتا) is an Iranian cloud-based, cross-platform, social media, instant messaging (IM) and VoIP service developed by the Idea of Today's Civilization Supporters Company. It is one of the most widely used messaging apps in Iran, with more than 40 million users and the largest messaging app based in Western Asia. Eitaa enables users to send text and voice messages, share images and videos, make voice and video calls, share files and locations, pay bills, and access AI and services.
Eitaa is available on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, and the web. Registration requires a mobile telephone number.


== History ==
Eitaa was introduced as part of Iran's growing digital ecosystem, as a local alternative to international messaging platforms. Over the years, it has become a popular messaging app for millions of users in Iran, meeting the communication, business, and social networking needs of both domestic and international users. It was removed by Google Play and Apple store in 2022 along with many other Iranian platforms.


== Features ==
Eitaa has a range of features designed for communication and user experience. These include text and voice messaging, multimedia sharing, voice and video calls, and file sharing. The platform also provides payment services for tasks such as paying bills, making purchases, and conducting transactions securely and has two step verification for securing accounts. Users can share their real-time location and access a variety of services through bots, including customer support and bill payments.


== Message Exchange Bus (MXB) ==

Eitaa is connected to the Message Exchange Bus (MXB), which is a technology that connects major Iranian messaging platforms like Bale, Eitaa, Soroush, Rubika, Gap and iGap and enables users to send messages and files, make voice and video calls and more to more than 100 million users between these apps without needing a separate account for each one, offering communication regardless of the platform used. This system is instrumental in creating a unified messaging ecosystem in Iran and is created for the first time in Iran.


== Social networking ==
Eitaa has some social networking features, including the ability for users to follow public accounts, participate in channels, share updates, photos, and videos. While the platform is widely adopted for social interaction, its features aim to meet a broad range of user needs, contributing to its growing use as a social platform.


== Services ==


=== Banking Services ===
Eitaa offers banking features, including bill payments, account recharges, and other financial tasks. These services are integrated into the app, allowing users to perform various financial transactions.


=== Bots and AI ===
Eitaa includes AI-powered bots that assist with tasks such as subscription management, business services, and customer support. These bots are intended to automate certain processes within the app.


== Removal from App Stores ==
Eitaa was removed from both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, along with several other Iranian apps. This removal came as part of a broader action taken by these platforms to restrict access to apps from Iran. Despite this, Eitaa continues to be available through other app stores like Bazaar and Myket and to direct download, maintaining its user base.
