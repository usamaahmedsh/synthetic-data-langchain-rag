Ui Shigure (しぐれうい, Shigure Ui) is a Japanese illustrator, manga artist, light novel character designer, musician and VTuber.


== Career ==
Shigure was born in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, Japan. She is an art graduate.
After working in a game development company, she began working as a freelance illustrator.
In August 2018, she started designing the appearance for Hololive Production's Virtual YouTuber Oozora Subaru, who debuted in September the same year. Since then, she occasionally appears as a guest on Hololive member livestreams, particularly with Subaru and Miko. In May 2019, she began livestreaming as a virtual YouTuber, where she livestreams herself chatting to the audience, illustrating and playing video games.
Shigure's 2022 song—"Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem", which was included in her debut solo album, The Rain Doesn't Stop Yet—went viral online in September 2023 after the release of its music video. She has expressed her surprise at the sudden growth of her song and subsequently her channel.


== Personal life ==
Shigure has said that from a young age, her mother influenced her to start drawing. She also cites Arina Tanemura, Noizi Ito and Cocoa Fujiwara as major influences on her work.
