== Reception ==
Brian Shaer at Film Threat scored it 7 out of 10, calling it a "chuckle-worthy diversion" and a "painless and fun experiment". Both Melee Stormbringer of Horror News and Ben Ragunton of Two Gay Geeks found it funny, comparing the film to Murder by Death and Clue. Emilie Black of Cinema Crazed said "it’s campy, it’s funny, it’s a bit ridiculous" and compared Butler's character to Renfield. Robert Mitchell Evans stated that it has a "lovely retro feel complete with a classic 30’s style of credits and paid homage to classic tropes".
