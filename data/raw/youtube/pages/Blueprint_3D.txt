Blueprint 3D is a puzzle video game for iOS developed by German studio FDG Entertainment and published in November 2011. The object of the game is to rotate a seemingly random jumble of dots and lines in three dimensions until they resolve into a blueprint, a line drawing of an object. The player's score for each of the 240 levels is calculated based on the time needed to solve the puzzle.
