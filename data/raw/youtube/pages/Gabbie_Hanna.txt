== Early life ==
Hanna was born Gabrielle Hanna on February 7, 1991, in New Castle, Pennsylvania. In 2013, Hanna graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in psychology and communications. While at Pitt, she was a member of Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority. After college, she worked for a marketing company that sold products out of a Sam's Club; she became the top salesperson in the US for the company and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to help start a new branch of the company. However, she departed after realizing that they relied on a pyramid scheme.


== Career ==
Hanna began uploading skits to Vine in late 2013 and later gained recognition for her activity on the Vine app, where she accumulated around five million followers. In 2014, she set up a YouTube channel under the name The Gabbie Show, which was changed to Gabbie Hanna in 2017 after the release of her debut single "Out Loud", but was later changed back to The Gabbie Show in 2021.
In 2015, Hanna and partner Matt Steffanina won the fourth season of the dance competition web-series Dance Showdown. After college, Hanna moved to Los Angeles, California, to work with internet media company BuzzFeed, but eventually left to focus on her YouTube and Vine platforms. In December 2015, a video accusing Gabbie Hanna of stealing jokes went viral on Reddit. In Hanna's response to these claims, she states she "never have and never will consider [herself] a comedian".
After Vine shut down in 2016, Hanna focused on YouTube. Meanwhile, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards — Choice Web Star: Female and Choice Viner. In late 2016, Hanna joined the lip sync tour Drop the Mic alongside other YouTubers.
In 2017, Hanna released a book of poetry, Adultolescence. Around the same time, she premiered her debut single "Out Loud" along with its music video and announced plans to release an album titled This Time Next Year. A few months later, Creative Artists Agency signed Hanna and she joined MTV's social media team. In June 2017, Hanna joined the main cast of web series Escape the Night as the vaudevillian and appeared in seven episodes. She co-hosted the revival of Total Request Live in October 2017. In November 2017, she released a non-album single, "Satellite", with an accompanying lyrics video.
In January 2018, Hanna was nominated for YouTuber of the Year at the 10th Shorty Awards and for the Social Star Award at the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards. Hanna released her third single "Honestly" and its encore "Honestly (Encore)" in August 2018. At the eighth Annual Streamy Awards, Hanna won an award for Storyteller and was nominated for First Person and Audience Choice: Creator of the Year. On a 2018 interview on Genius' Verified, she sang her song "Monster" a cappella but due to technical errors, the microphone was unable to record her voice properly. Fans spliced in clips, including vines and voice distortions, at the point of technical error to create a meme. Hanna has since released merchandise showcasing her singing face during the meme.
On February 2, 2019, Hanna released "Medicate", the first single from her debut extended play titled 2WayMirror. On May 31, 2019, 2WayMirror was released. For a period of time after the songs' release, Hanna peaked at number 5 on Billboard's Top Emerging Artists chart.

The first single from Hanna's second EP, Bad Karma, "Dandelion", was released on April 17, 2020, and the second single, "Glass House", was released on May 1, 2020. The EP was released on May 15, 2020. On October 13, 2020, Hanna released a new book of poetry, Dandelion, named after the lead single of her Bad Karma EP.
Following multiple controversies with her former friends and collaborators, Hanna has taken extended breaks from social media on a few different occasions. To celebrate New Years, Hanna returned to social media and released "Rewired", a single from her debut album, Trauma Queen. She later announced that she had scrapped This Time Next Year and Trauma Queen would be released on July 22, 2022, putting the album up for pre-order, as well as restarting and rebranding her podcast. Hanna hosted her first live performance since November 2019 on February 22, 2022. In late August 2022, Hanna sparked global conversation around mental health challenges by publishing hundreds of controversial social media posts (including posts where she claimed to be the second coming of Jesus) in only a few days.
In November 2022, Hanna released "Haircut", the first single from her sophomore album, This Time Next Year. A snippet of the song was first shared to her TikTok profile in November 2022. Following the upload, the song garnered attention across the platform, causing Hanna to release the song. On December 23, 2022, Hanna released This Time Next Year, which peaked at 14 on the US iTunes Chart.


== Personal life ==
Hanna identifies as a Christian, which has inspired many of her songs and poems.
She has spoken openly about her struggles with mental illness, including OCD, ADHD, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.
Hanna took a social media hiatus from February 2023 to March 2024.
