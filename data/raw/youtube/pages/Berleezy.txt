== Life and career ==
Berlin Edmond Jr. was born on December 16, 1992. He has an older sister, Britani, who is also a YouTuber. He created his YouTube channel in 2013. While attending California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), where he majored in English and was the president of the school's Black Student Union, Edmond found success on YouTube with Exposed, a series of videos in which he jokingly critiqued intros to children's television series, after his tweet of a clip of him roasting the Hey Arnold! intro went viral in 2015. He soon graduated from CSUF and, in 2017, his channel reached one million subscribers.
Edmond created a gaming YouTube channel in 2016 and later became a popular video game streamer on Twitch. Tennis player Naomi Osaka debuted her Fortnite outfit in a Twitch stream with Edmond in 2022. In the summer of 2022, Edmond participated in a gaming livestream series hosted by State Farm called the Gamerhood, which featured multiple gaming content creators, such as Ninja. He also participated in the second season a year later.
In early February 2023, Edmond's channel was briefly terminated, which fans believed to be in response to his gameplay video of the video game Poop Killer 4.
