== Reception ==
Pocket Gamer highlights the Quality-of-Life features and generous gacha system, but notes that there were translation issues. BunnyGaming.com echoes the translation issues and criticized the poor gacha pity system, but praises the game's visuals and auto-play features. Hardcore iOS remarks that "resource grinding and farming is one of the spots where improvements can be made," but otherwise considers Artery Gear: Fusion as "a decent timesink."
