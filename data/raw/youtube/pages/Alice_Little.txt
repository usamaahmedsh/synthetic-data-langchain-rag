Alice Little (born May 3, 1990) is an Irish-American sex worker and YouTuber. Her stage name, Alice Little, refers to her height, which is 4'8", making her the "shortest legal escort" in Nevada, and consequently, in the United States.
Little gained attention in 2017 after she wrote an article for Refinery29 entitled "A Week as a Legal Sex Worker in Mound House, NV, on a $267,000 Salary." She has since become known for her advocacy for sex workers. In 2019, she received further press for offering a 50% discount for attendees of Alienstock Festival.
When not working, Little resides in Carson City, Nevada.

Little was born "just outside of Dublin," Ireland and moved to the U.S. when she was five years old. Little grew up in Nassau County, Long Island, New York.
Before joining the legal sex work industry, she was a jockey at Belmont Stakes and an emergency medical technician in New York City.


== Luxury companion career ==
Little has been in the legal sex work industry since November 2015 when she started work at the Sagebrush Ranch, then moved on to the Moonlite BunnyRanch in October 2017. In May 2021, Little moved to the Chicken Ranch due to its location in the first Nevada county to announce brothels were allowed to reopen since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Little runs workshops for the other sex workers at the ranch, focusing on business management.

She is a founding member of Hookers for Healthcare and an active member of the Nevada Brothel Association.
