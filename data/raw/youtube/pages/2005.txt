2005 (MMV) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2005th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 5th  year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the  6th   year of the 2000s decade.  
2005 was designated as the International Year for Sport and Physical Education and the International Year of Microcredit. The beginning of 2005 also marked the end of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People (1995–2005). 


== Population ==
The world population on January 1, 2005, was estimated to be 6.545 billion people and increased to 6.629 billion people by January 1, 2006. An estimated 137.2 million births and 53.4 million deaths took place in 2005. The average global life expectancy was 68.1 years, an increase of 0.4 years from 2004. The estimated number of global refugees decreased from 9.54 million to its lowest in 25 years, 8.39 million refugees, by the end of the year. Afghanistan was the largest source of refugees with approximately 1.9 million people.


== Conflicts ==

There were 32 conflicts in 2005 that caused at least 25 fatalities, all of which were intrastate wars involving violent non-state actors. Five of these resulted in over 1,000 fatalities: the Iraqi insurgency, the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, the Kashmir insurgency, the Nepalese Civil War, and the Colombian conflict. Among continuing conflicts from previous years, the Iraqi insurgency meant further violence in Iraq throughout 2005, including a major suicide bombing on February 28 and a series of attacks as the Iraqi Transitional Government was established in April and May. The Second Chechen War in Russia saw the assassination of Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov by Russian forces on March 8, and the Kivu conflict and Ituri conflict continued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo despite the formal end of the Second Congo War in 2002.
The government of Myanmar broke its 2003 ceasefire with the Karen National Union in January, and it engaged in heightened conflict with the Shan State Army (RCSS) in April. The frozen conflict between Azerbaijan and the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh also reignited as a 1994 ceasefire collapsed. In Sri Lanka, peace talks broke down with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Peace talks took place to end the Second Intifada between Israel and Palestine, which were complicated by attacks from Palestinian militant groups and subsequent Israeli retaliation. Hezbollah also engaged in conflict with Israel, causing violence in Golan Heights and on the Israel–Lebanon border. New rebel groups that emerged in 2005 included the Rally for Democracy and Liberty in Chad, the National Socialist Council of Nagaland in India, the Kurdistan Free Life Party in Iran, and the Maoist Communist Party in Turkey.
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement between Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement was signed on January 9, ending the Second Sudanese Civil War. The other conflict in Sudan, the War in Darfur, remained active with heavy targeting of civilians and aid workers. The First Ivorian Civil War remained frozen as a fragile ceasefire held between Ivory Coast and the Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire while peace negotiations stalled. The Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan remained mostly peaceful, though militant groups carried out occasional attacks.


== Culture ==

The highest-grossing film globally in 2005 was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, followed by Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Critically acclaimed films from 2005 include Brokeback Mountain and A History of Violence.
Revenue from digital music sales became the third biggest music market in 2005 when it exceeded revenue from singles. The best-selling album globally in 2005 was X&Y by Coldplay, followed by The Emancipation of Mimi by Mariah Carey and The Massacre by 50 Cent. The best-selling non-English album was the Spanish-language album Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 by Shakira, the 27th best-selling of the year.
Critically acclaimed video games from 2005 include Civilization IV, God of War, and Resident Evil 4.


== Economy ==

The gross world product increased by 3.2% in 2005, slowing from the 4.0% growth of 2004. International trade grew by 7.1% in volume, decreasing from the 11.0% growth of 2004. The price of oil surged in 2005, but not to the extent of a similar surge in 2004. Depreciation of the United States dollar reversed in 2005 as it gained value relative to the euro and Japanese yen, though it continued depreciating relative to the currencies of many developing nations.


== Environment and weather ==

The year 2005 was estimated to be tied with 1998 as the hottest year on record. Areas around the Arctic Circle were especially hot relative to historical temperatures. Heatwaves occurred in Australia in March through May and the Southwestern United States in July, while the Balkans experienced extreme cold in February. The year had average rainfall globally. Heavy rain led to floods in Colombia, Saudi Arabia, and central and eastern Europe, while Brazil and southeastern Africa faced severe droughts. An 8.6 magnitude earthquake struck on March 28 and killed approximately 1,300 people in Sumatra, and a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck on October 8 and killed approximately 80,000 people in Kashmir.
The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active in recorded history with 28 storms, exceeding the 1933 record of 21 storms, including 15 hurricanes, exceeding the 1969 record of 12 hurricanes. Four hurricanes reached category 5: Hurricane Emily, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and Hurricane Wilma. Katrina was the most costly hurricane, killing approximately 1,500 people and causing about $81 billion in damage. Hurricane Stan caused flooding that killed another 1,000 to 2,000 people. The 2005 Pacific typhoon season was average in intensity, and there were a total of 24 tropical storms. Two typhoons reached category 5: Typhoon Haitang and Typhoon Nabi. China was the most severely affected by the season, facing approximately $3 billion in damage.
