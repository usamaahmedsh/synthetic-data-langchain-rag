== History ==
The City of Howell is the county seat of Livingston County. On 24 March 1836, the legislature passed an act organizing Livingston County. Howell was slated to become the county seat, but the newly established Brighton nearby claimed the seat for the next 12 years.


=== 19th century ===
January 1836 saw the establishment of the first post office in Howell. Flavius J. B. Crane was postmaster, and the post office was in the Eagle Tavern. In March of this same year, there was a mail route started in the village of Kensington that went through Howell until ending in Grand Rapids. The pioneer manufacturing enterprise of Howell was a sawmill built in 1836, soon followed by a blacksmith shop.
The town was originally called Livingston Center, formed as a village by an act of the legislature on 14 March 1863 consisting of sections 35 and 36, and the south half of sections 25 and 26 of Howell Township.
Before and during the Civil War, the city of Howell was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Most notably, the Historic Howell Opera House, located downtown, served as a station on the Underground Railroad. The opera house provided refuge to freedom seekers fleeing slavery in the South, offering them temporary shelter and assistance on their journey to Canada.
Among the slaves fleeing persecution was Abraham Losford, the first Black resident of Howell. Losford fled north from Kentucky with nothing but his clippers, where he had been enslaved and served as a plantation barber. Local residents helped Losford establish a barber shop in downtown Howell, which remained open until his death. Abraham Losford died in 1897 and is buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Howell. His obituary states that quote, "His presence, as well as his open, manly character, was a living reminder of the sin of slavery. Many winters will come and go before the name of 'Old Uncle Abe' is forgotten in the community."
By the 1890s, there were a number of prominent Black families living in Howell, including Losford, his son Ben Losford, the Childers, Charles Straws, Dave Anderson, manager of the Howell City semi-pro baseball team, and George Jewett.
Jewett was a renaissance man and all-American athlete. Born in 1870 in Ann Arbor, Jewett was valedictorian of his 1889 graduating class, captain of his debate, football and baseball teams, and at one time was the fastest sprinter in the Midwest, and was fluent in German, Italian, and French. Jewett played football for the University of Michigan and Northwestern University, being the first person of color to play in the Big Ten Conference. Jewett practiced medicine in Chicago briefly before returning to Michigan and settling near Howell, where he became the Howell High School football coach, the first black coach of a Michigan high school.
Howell's profound friendliness to Black families attracted more to settle in Howell during the late 19th century. Among other notable black residents was Lulu Childers, whose family were also freed slaves from Kentucky. Lulu  and her sister, Nancy, were Howell High School valedictorians (1890  and 1893, respectively).


=== 20th century ===
The Howell Home Rule City Charter was adopted in 1955.
The 1920s saw a national revival of the Ku Klux Klan following the release of the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation. This "second wave" of the Klan expanded its targets to include not only African Americans but also Catholics, Jews, and immigrants.
As a result of Howell's reputation as a destination for former slaves, and for its thriving African American business community, the city was targeted by hate groups, especially the Klan.
It increased across Michigan and Livingston County during the American civil rights era. Since the 1970s, Howell has had a national reputation for being associated with the Klan. White supremacist leader and Michigan Grand Dragon (1971–1979) Robert E. Miles held gatherings on his farm 12 miles north of the city in Cohoctah Township. Miles died in 1992, but the gatherings, including the burning of crosses, continued.
The Livingston Diversity Council, founded in response to a 1988 cross burning on the lawn of a Black family, has been promoting diversity and inclusion in the county. While they are numerous in Metro Detroit, as of 2011, Howell was not listed as an active home to any hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
On October 22, 1994, less than a dozen Ku Klux Klansmen from outside Howell held a rally on the steps of the historic Livingston County Courthouse. According to a reporter for the Livingston Post, the town may have been chosen because of its reputation for intolerance. Ben Bohnsack, the pastor of the First United Methodist Church in nearby Brighton, Michigan, at the time, described the approaching rally as an "assault on the values" of the community. On the day of the rally, the courthouse was put under the protection of 174 police officers from every law enforcement agency in the county. An 8-foot-tall chain-link fence was erected around the courthouse, with two additional sections raised on Grand River Avenue to contain protesters and observers. The fence was dismantled after the rally, and on the following day, citizens assembled with brooms, mops, and buckets for a symbolic cleansing of the courthouse steps.


=== 21st century ===
Activities associated with the Ku Klux Klan persisted into the 2000s, with events such as a public auction of Klan items scheduled for Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday in January 2005, the 2010 suspension of a teacher who removed students for wearing a Confederate flag and making anti-gay slurs, and students' racist tweets toward a racially mixed team in 2014.

On October 5, 2021, President Joe Biden visited Howell for a speech to build support for his Build Back Better Plan.
On July 21, 2024, about a dozen masked white supremacists marched through downtown Howell, chanting "Heil Hitler" and carrying signs with messages such as "White Lives Matter" and "End the War on White Children". They began their demonstration on the lawn of the Livingston County courthouse, where, in 1994, members of the community symbolically scrubbed the steps following a Klan rally. Several miles east of Howell at the Latson Road/I-96 overpass in Genoa Township, Michigan, pictures posted to a community Facebook group showed demonstrators hanging Klan and Nazi flags over the side of the overpass. One of the photos showed them with a Donald Trump flag, while the Livingston Post uploaded a video made by a passerby in which one of the protestors is heard saying, "We love Hitler. We love Trump." On July 28, 2024, one week after the white supremacist march, at an anti-white supremacist counterprotest in downtown Howell, residents cleansed the sidewalk to symbolically wash away the racism. On August 20, 2024, Donald Trump visited Howell for a campaign speech. On July 14, 2025, hundreds of Howell residents congregated in front of the city hall on Grand River Ave. in participation in the No Kings protests.  On October 15, 2025, over 2,200 protestors participated at the same location for the second round of "No kings day."
