Reclaim the Streets, also known as RTS, are a collective with a shared ideal of community ownership of public spaces. Participants characterise the collective as a resistance movement opposed to the dominance of corporate forces in globalisation, and to the car as the dominant mode of transport.
Reclaim the Streets often stage non-violent direct action street reclaiming events such as the 'invasion' of a major road, highway or motorway to stage a party. While this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as car drivers and public bus riders, the philosophy of RTS is that it is vehicle traffic, not pedestrians, who are causing the obstruction, and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space. The events are usually spectacular and colourful, with sand pits for children to play in, free food and music. At a minority of events, where the police have tried to violently shut down the event there has been violence between protestors and police.
Reclaim the Streets, as a collective, and by extension of all events that take this name regardless of their relationship to the original collective, often engage in non-violent direct actions of reclamation, events such as "invading" a road, highway, or freeway to hold a party. 
Reclaim the Streets was originally formed by Earth First!

Camden High Street, 14 May 1995. The first major RTS street party action took over a busy London street and closed it to motor-traffic for an afternoon. Around 500 people took over the street. There was free food served from tables in the middle of the road, and music played from a bicycle-powered sound system. A climbing frame was placed in the middle of a crossroad junction and children were able to play on it. The action met on the high street in the afternoon and left from the Rainbow Centre, a squatted Church in Kentish Town.
Upper Street, Islington, 23 July 1995. Three thousand people party at another busy traffic junction. Banners are stretched between lampposts, with messages such as ‘STREET NOW OPEN’ and ‘CAR FREE’. There is a sound system as well as a live band that uses a bus stop as a stage. Kids play in a hastily constructed sandpit.
Birmingham, 6 August 1995. Organised with a handful of people around 200 people turn up for family afternoon with live band playing from the back of a truck. To prevent police using riot tactics to clear the street at the end, a procession with music and dancing headed off down the road to a pub.
