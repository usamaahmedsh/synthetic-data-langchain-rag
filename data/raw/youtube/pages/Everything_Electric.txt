Everything Electric (previously "The Fully Charged Show") is a YouTube channel, podcast, website, and live event focusing on electric vehicles and renewable energy founded by writer, broadcaster and actor Robert Llewellyn. Llewellyn later became Joint CEO of Fully Charged with Dan Caesar and Caesar also presents many of the episodes of the show. They are both joined by many regular presenters along with guest presenters from many different countries. The channel has covered a wide range of topics around electric vehicles including electric cars, electric bikes, electric aircraft, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Everything Electric also covers a wide range of renewable energy topics including solar power, wind power, UK energy policy, cycling infrastructure, air pollution and air pollution monitoring.
Everything Electric began in 2010 as "Fully Charged" (later "the Fully Charged Show" in 2022) and has since amassed more than 1 million subscribers and over 200 million views as of December 2024 with over 1,000 episodes. The channel is viewer supported through the crowdfunding platform Patreon or can be supported through a YouTube channel premium membership which provides access to Fully Charged Plus. The channel was previously supported through advertising and partnerships with Ecotricity, Bosch and British Gas.
Everything Electric also produces a weekly podcast discussing news and current topics not covered by the videos. In May 2019 a second YouTube channel, named Fully Charged Plus (formerly Fully Charged Regen), was launched with the purpose of uploading all the podcast episodes in YouTube video format, and releasing other longer-format videos such as talks and lectures, different from the usual episodes. In October of 2022, the second YouTube channel was renamed to Everything Electric Show with a focus on home energy systems and solutions.
The organization also hosts many live events each year throughout the world. First known as Fully Charged Live, the events later were rebranded as Everything Electric, which is a combination of an all-electric vehicle show and home energy show. Thousands attend these events to learn more about home energy solutions and for the electric vehicle test drives, with some vehicle manufacturers debuting their new electric models to the public for the first time at these shows.

The inaugural Fully Charged Live event, was held at Silverstone Circuit over the weekend of 9-10 June 2018.  The event included panel discussions, presentations, exhibitions stalls from vendors and sponsors, and vehicle displays.  Attendance at the event exceeded Llewellyn's expectations - attracting over 6,000 people.  This event introduced physicist Dr Helen Czerski as a presenter of the team. 
In 2019 the event took place in Silverstone on 7–9 June, and the first event in the United States, titled Fully Charged Live USA, was at Circuit of the Americas near Austin, Texas on 1–2 February 2020. After a year of lockdown the event continued at Farnborough International in 2021 with over 16,000 attending and Fully Charged continues to host many shows each year at different locations around the world.
In April 2023, the organisers announced a rebrand of the event to Everything Electric, starting with the February 2024 event Everything Electric Australia. Another popular feature of the events is the test drives of electric vehicles having served over 100,000 test drives across a span of 15 shows.
