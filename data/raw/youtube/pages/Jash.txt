Jash (stylized as JASH) is a comedy community and advertising agency created by Michael Cera, Tim Heidecker, Eric Wareheim, Sarah Silverman and Reggie Watts. New videos are posted to the Jash homepage periodically by the creative team, and by new members of the always expanding collective of comics. Jash premiered online March 10, 2013. Since its launch, Jash has gone on to extend its reach into traditional media with television, series and award-winning short films.
"JASH" was picked as the name of the channel instead of "JOSH" because the domain had already been taken. Later on, the backronym "Just Attitude So Hey" was created to fit the "JASH" name.
