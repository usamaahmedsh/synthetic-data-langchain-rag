=== Chess tournament cheating controversy ===
In April 2025, Lupo participated in the Chess.com $100,000 prize pool PogChamps tournament with other content creators. After being caught cheating using a chess engine, he was disqualified from the tournament and his Chess.com account was closed. After initially denying any cheating and then claiming to have had the broadcast open before his disqualification was confirmed, Lupo then blamed getting moves from chat. The following day, Lupo admitted to having used a chess engine, claiming that he only started using it after he blundered his queen. He apologized. Lupo has offered to pay for the next PogChamps tournament or donate $100,000 to a chess-related charity.
