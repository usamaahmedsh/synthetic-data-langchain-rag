== Overview ==
GO Inc. operates within the travel and vehicle-for-hire industry throughout Japan, including taxi services, with a focus on the ride-hailing app "GO". It was established in 1977 as a subsidiary of Nihon Kotsu's computer systems branch (Nihon Kotsu Calculation Center Co., Ltd., and from 1992, Nihon Kotsu Data Services Co., Ltd.)
In 2010, the company began developing and providing taxi dispatch apps such as "National Taxi Dispatch" for operators throughout Japan. As competition in the app market grew, the company changed its name to JapanTaxi Co., Ltd., in 2015, and the app became "JapanTaxi" in 2018.
The current structure was established in 2020, when JapanTaxi merged with DeNA's MOV division, which provided the taxi dispatch app "MOV", and changed its name to Mobility Technologies Co., Ltd. It began developing its own dispatch app based on "MOV" and named it "GO" within the same year.
On 1 April 2023, the company became GO Inc. On 24 November 2023, GO Inc. moved its headquarters to Azabudai Hills Mori JP Tower.
