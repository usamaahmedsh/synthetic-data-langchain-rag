This list of most-liked YouTube videos contains the top 30 videos with the most likes of all time, taken directly from the video page. The American video platform YouTube implemented a like and dislike button on these pages in March 2010, part of a major redesign of the site. This served as a replacement for their five-star rating system; YouTube's designers found the previous system ineffective because the options to rate a video between two and four stars were rarely selected.
The music video for LMFAO's song "Party Rock Anthem" stood as the most-liked video on YouTube in 2012, with 1.56 million likes, until the video for Psy's "Gangnam Style" surpassed it in September that year with more than 1.57 million likes. Following this accomplishment, "Gangnam Style" entered the Guinness World Records book as the most-liked video on YouTube and on the Internet as of 2012. Psy's video remained the most-liked on YouTube for nearly four years until August 27, 2016, when Wiz Khalifa's "See You Again" featuring Charlie Puth surpassed it with 11.21 million likes. Less than a year later, on July 25, 2017, Luis Fonsi's "Despacito" music video featuring Daddy Yankee claimed the top spot with 16.01 million likes. Despacito became the first YouTube video to reach 50 million likes on October 23, 2022. "Despacito" remained the most-liked video for over seven years until January 27, 2025, when MrBeast's "Would You Fly to Paris for a Baguette?" video surpassed it with 55 million likes. It is also the most-liked video uploaded under the YouTube Shorts banner.
The most liked non-music and non-short video is also held by MrBeast, with his video called "Make This Video The Most Liked Video On Youtube" which has over 30 million likes as of April 2025. He has held this record since May 2019, after surpassing PewDiePie's most liked non-music video.
