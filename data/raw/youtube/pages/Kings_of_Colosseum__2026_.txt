=== Background ===
Kings of Colosseum is a reoccurring professional wrestling supercard event produced by MLW that was first held on July 6, 2019. The first event would air live as a special episode of MLW's weekly television series, Fusion.
On September 15, 2025, MLW announced that Kings of Colosseum would take place on January 10, 2026, at the NYTEX Sports Centre in North Richland Hills, Texas. This will be the second consecutive Kings of Colosseum held at the venue, following 2025. However, on November 25, MLW announced that the Kings of Colosseum would be rescheduled for later in the year due to the announcement of new events around its original date.


=== Storylines ===
The card consisted of matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out at MLW events, and across the league's social media platforms.
