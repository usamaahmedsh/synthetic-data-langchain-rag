== Reception ==
The Daily Telegraph termed the game, "the closest thing I've played to an interactive fairy-tale", while The Harvard Crimson called it a "charming journey", lauding its minimalistic art style and playful music. "What makes Burly Men at Sea different from the heaps of illustrated books my dad read to me as a kid is that you get to control the path the story takes," noted Kill Screen.
