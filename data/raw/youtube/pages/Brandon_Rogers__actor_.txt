== Career ==
Rogers began creating videos for his job in Los Angeles at a personal injury law firm where he made documentaries that were shot by Gabriel Gonzales on the daily life of plaintiffs that were used in court. He had the idea to make humorous versions of these documentaries with Gonzales and started his YouTube channel on January 7, 2006, as "HotBananaStud." Rogers first gained recognition in 2015 when a Vine user uploaded six-second clips of his videos in uncredited roles. After a clip from one of his videos went viral on Vine and was featured on Fine Brothers Entertainment's React series, the original creator of the video became publicly known, and Rogers gained online fame.
In 2016, Super Deluxe offered to produce a show for Rogers. The show, Magic Funhouse! was available on Fullscreen's short-lived subscription service and was the service's most-watched original show. Magic Funhouse! was nominated for Best Comedy Series at the 7th Annual Streamy Awards. In 2017, Rogers was named a New Face: Creator at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival. In addition to co-hosting the event, he was nominated for four awards and won the awards for Scripted Series and Acting at the 9th Annual Streamy Awards for his web series Blame the Hero. In 2018, Rogers was a 10th Annual Shorty Awards finalist for the Best YouTube Comedian award. Rogers collaborated with Comedy Central in 2019 for their "Under the Influencer" program which had him take over the company's social media platforms for a week.
