=== Social media ===
Osborn was laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic and joined TikTok in November 2020, encouraged by her younger sister and wanting something to pass the time. She began discussing her ADHD on the app out of frustration, feeling that existing content on the disorder did not reflect her own experiences and that its impact on sex, kink, and relationships was not being discussed.
In early 2021, Osborn participated in Ships of the Northern Fleet, a collaborative improv project with several other TikTokers surrounding a nonexistent steampunk sky pirate fantasy book and television series from the 2000s; within this metafiction, Osborn claimed to have played Annie Wreyburn, the show's bisexual lead character who was controversially killed off. TikTok users played along by creating a genuine fandom for the imaginary show. Additionally, Osborn and the other "cast members" held in-character Q&A livestreams on Twitch and YouTube.


== Personal life ==
Osborn is non-binary and uses she/her and they/them pronouns and the gender-neutral honorific Mx. She identifies as polyamorous, bisexual, pansexual and demi/greysexual. She is married and owns a pet dog named Bailey.
Osborn was diagnosed with ADHD the day before her 30th birthday. After having her left ovary removed due to an ovarian torsion, she experienced a hormonal imbalance that exacerbated her latent ADHD, severely impacting her memory and focus. Osborn initially believed she was experiencing early onset dementia until a friend with ADHD suggested she might have the disorder, prompting her to seek an evaluation. She has said that she "grew up my whole life believing I was broken and weird and wrong and everybody else had the memo and I didn’t".
In addition to ADHD, Osborn has myoclonic dystonia and experiences muscle spasms and chronic pain; she sees her BDSM work in part as taking charge of her chronic pain and ADHD. She also suffered from bulimia from the age of 15 until beginning therapy in her 30s, and has suggested that her ADHD symptoms of executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation contributed to her disordered eating.
