Angry Video Game Nerd (abbreviated as AVGN) is an American web series of comedy-themed retrogaming reviews, created by and starring James Rolfe. The show revolves around reviews that involve acerbic rants about low quality video games. From the beginning of season 2, new episodes were aired first on GameTrailers.com, but are since now aired at Cinemassacre.com, with episodes later being re-aired on Rolfe's own YouTube channel. Episodes are usually scheduled for release on the first or second Wednesday of each month; originally, Rolfe's early work schedule allowed for two episodes per month, but other work commitments changed this to its present arrangement.
The only Angry Video Game Nerd episode, although still available for viewing, that never officially made it to/remained on YouTube in its original form was Atari Porn, which was removed after the site flagged it for inappropriate content per its community guidelines. On November 21, 2023, a heavily censored version was officially uploaded to the Cinemassacre YouTube channel, under the name Atari Pork. The two part review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 was removed for copyright issues, however an edited version was reuploaded in 2020 as one video. Two other episodes were later removed for using movie clips from copyrighted films – Rocky and Super Mario Bros. 3 – but were later reuploaded to YouTube after being amended and changed to comply with the website's policies.
