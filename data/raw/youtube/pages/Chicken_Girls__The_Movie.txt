== Plot ==
The film kicks off with Rhyme and TK on a date in Paris, actually a movie scene directed by TK and Flash. Later, Rhyme, Ellie, Kayla, and Quinn discuss Spring Fling and dance date plans. Rhyme wishes to go with TK. The school sings "Dancing on the Ceiling," interrupted by Principal Anthony, who bans hallway singing, puzzling Ellie.
The Chicken Girls chat about Principal Anthony, and Luna predicts Power Surge will shine at tryouts. Senõr Singer notes the focus on the dance over academics. TK, Flash, and Ace discuss reshooting their movie. Ace questions why it's not done, leading to a squabble with Flash about priorities. TK suggests their bickering is why they lack dance invites. Ace and Flash reassure TK, reminding him he hasn't been asked to the dance.
Ellie, at the library, sings and is interrupted by Davis, who compliments her. Thinking he wants a Spring Fling date, Ellie shuts him down, but he clarifies he doesn't want to go to the dance. Davis helps her with polynomials. Flash praises TK's movie to Rhyme, inquiring about Spring Fling plans, but TK hasn't been asked. In another part of the library, Kayla discusses potential dance partners with Flash and tells him to text her. Quinn and Rooney argue, noted by Birdie, who remarks they fight like biological siblings.
Senõr Singer holds auditions, and Ace's performance is stopped for getting too close. Attaway Dance Team and Power Surge have a dance battle. Sheldon questions TK and Flash filming, prompting them to follow him. Senõr Singer declares both teams will perform together, frustrating Birdie and Luna.
Rhyme shares her troubles with Harmony, who discovers Principal Anthony has a crush on Senõr Singer. Harmony plans to save the spring fling, enlisting Rooney, Ace, and Luna. The plan unfolds: Rhyme gives Principal Anthony cashmere, Ace asks Senõr Singer about her, and Luna falsely informs Sheldon Rhyme is skipping class. Principal Anthony and Sheldon visit the elderly home, and Rhyme and Rooney talk to an elderly couple. Luna, disguised as an old lady, expresses a wish for one last dance. Principal Anthony reinstates the dance, but they must pass the Test Test. Rhyme misses a study date with TK.
Birdie and Tim study, while Kayla texts Flash, advised by Ace not to respond. Rooney invites Quinn to study with her and Hamilton, but is declined. Ellie and Davis collaborate on their studies. Kayla regrets considering asking Flash and tells him it was a mistake. Hamilton suggests Rooney ask him to the dance, but she insists on asking someone else first. Rhyme apologizes to TK for missing their study date.
After the Test Test, Rhyme finds out she failed, blaming Harmony's distracting scheme. Rhyme sings as everyone prepares for the dance. Rooney and Quinn learn their parents aren't divorcing. Ellie, Kayla, and Quinn visit Rhyme's house, where they sing "Birds of a Feather." Rhyme apologizes, and they plan a way for her to attend the dance.
The dance kicks off with Ellie and Davis, Birdie and Tim, and Rooney inviting Hamilton to dance. Flash admits to Kayla about the texts, and they join the dance. Luna asks Ace for a friendly dance. TK dances with Dru but leaves upon not finding Rhyme. Attaway and Power Surge reconcile, and Rhyme shows up in a chicken suit. She strikes a deal with Principal Anthony to study extra hard if allowed to dance, and the two teams perform together. Rhyme returns home, apologizes to Harmony, and TK shows her a film he made about them. He reveals plans to spend the summer with Flash. As Rhyme leaves, TK stops her, and they share a kiss.
