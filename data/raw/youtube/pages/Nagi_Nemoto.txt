On 11 January 2022, she announced that she would be permanently leaving both of her idol groups, with her ill health making any continuance with Niji no Conquistador impractical, but would remain with DearStage as an illustrator and costume designer. Her final appearances with Niji no Conquistador and Dempagumi.inc were on 17 and 30 April, respectively, and she unveiled her VTuber persona on a cathode-ray tube television set at the latter event.
