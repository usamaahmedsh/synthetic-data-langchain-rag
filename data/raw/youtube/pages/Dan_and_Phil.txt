Dan and Phil are an English entertainment and business duo, consisting of partners Daniel Howell and Phil Lester. They are best known for their collaborative work on YouTube since meeting in 2009. Additionally, they have collaborated on television and radio presenting, books, tours, and original films.


== Background ==
Dan and Phil met on the internet in 2009 and in person that October. They have lived together since August 2011, first in Manchester before moving to London in July 2012. At the end of 2020, they announced they bought a home together, where they currently reside.
In June 2019, Howell came out as gay via a YouTube video on his channel. Lester followed suit by posting a coming out video to his own channel later that month. In Howell's video, he shared that the pair had been romantically involved at the beginning of their relationship, but refrained from clarifying its current status out of respect for his and Lester's privacy. In 2025, Howell and Lester confirmed they have been in a romantic relationship since 2009.


== YouTube ==
Lester uploaded his first video on his channel, AmazingPhil, in March 2006. Howell initially found Lester through YouTube and was a fan of his videos. After messaging with Lester online, Howell posted his first video to his YouTube channel, at the time called danisnotonfire, in October 2009. Later that month, Dan and Phil met in person and created their first collaboration, a Q&A video titled "phil is not on fire", posted to Lester's channel. The video sparked what would become a ten-part series, with one installment uploaded a year until the last one in 2018. Since 2009, Dan and Phil have frequently appeared in videos on each other's channels.


=== DanAndPhilGAMES ===

On 12 September 2014, Dan and Phil posted the first video on their joint gaming YouTube channel, DanAndPhilGAMES. On 8 March 2015 the channel hit 1 million subscribers. At the time, it was the fastest growing channel on YouTube. The channel reached over 3.1 million subscribers. The channel features Dan and Phil playing a variety of games. Some of the most popular series on the channel include the pair's Sims 4 Let's Play and "Gamingmas", an annual series where the duo uploads videos to the channel every day in December until Christmas.
In December 2018, the channel went on an indefinite hiatus. On 15 October 2023, Dan and Phil announced that they would both return to making videos on the channel in a video titled "Saying Goodbye Forever", directed by PJ Liguori and guest starring Jacksepticeye. In February 2024, they commissioned Lowave Records for a custom lo-fi and synthwave-inspired soundtrack for the channel, released as an album titled All or Nothing under the artist name DanAndPhilBEATS. In continued partnership with Lowave Records, they released four additional albums in 2024.
For Lester's birthday in January 2024, the pair hosted a two-hour charity livestream on the channel, through which they raised over $100,000 for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund. They hosted another livestream for Howell's birthday in June 2024 for the same charity, which also raised over $100,000.
On 13 October 2025, the DanAndPhilGAMES channel was rebranded to Dan and Phil, signifying the channel's expansion from strictly gaming content. Following the rebrand, Howell and Lester began hosting a weekly podcast called Hard Launch. Each episode includes a companion video version available on their YouTube channel. Hard Launch is produced by Studio71.
