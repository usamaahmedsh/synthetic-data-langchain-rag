Lego City Adventures has received favourable comments from critics about its positive messages but has also been criticised for its consumerism. Reviewer Emily Ashby for Common Sense Media gave the show a three-star rating, commenting that, "despite the fact that this series doubles as a pretty effective advertising campaign for the Lego brand/merchandise, it's a genuinely funny show with fast-paced, unpredictable humor". TV Guide UK gave the show a rating of 6/10.
