Critical Role Productions, LLC is an American multimedia production company incorporated in 2015 by the members of the creator-owned streaming show Critical Role. The company's first two shows, Critical Role and Talks Machina, originally premiered on Geek & Sundry. The company moved to its own studio space in 2018 and began producing new shows on its Twitch and YouTube channels. A split from Legendary Digital Networks was completed in early 2019, at which point Critical Role Productions took over production responsibility. Since then, the company has continued to launch new shows independently.
Critical Role Productions operates under several trade names for different forms of media, including the gaming imprint Darrington Press, the record label Scanlan Shorthalt Music, and the film and television production banner Metapigeon. In 2020, they established the Critical Role Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, to manage the company's charity projects. In 2023, Critical Role Productions signed a first-look film and television deal with Amazon Studios, and in 2024, they launched a boutique subscription streaming service called Beacon.


== History ==


=== Geek & Sundry era (2015–2019) ===
Critical Role Productions was founded by the members of the creator-owned Dungeons & Dragons streaming show Critical Role in 2015. The group had originally begun playing at home in 2012. Felicia Day approached them about live-streaming their game on Geek & Sundry after learning about their private tabletop role-playing game from Ashley Johnson. To streamline the game's mechanics for the show, its characters were converted from Pathfinder to Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition before the web series began airing on March 12, 2015. The company's first show, Critical Role, was a success. The company's second show, Talks Machina, premiered on Geek & Sundry and Alpha, Legendary Digital Networks' subscription streaming service, in 2016.
In June 2018, Critical Role launched its own Twitch and YouTube channels, with cast member Marisha Ray announced as the creative director of the franchise. The company then began self-producing new shows and content that did not air on Geek & Sundry's channels. The sets for Critical Role and Talks Machina moved from Legendary Digital Network's studios to Critical Role's own studios in July 2018.

The eight founders—the cast members of Critical Role―are the owners of equity stakes in the company. Since 2019, Travis Willingham has served as Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Mercer as Chief Creative Officer, and Marisha Ray as Creative Director. Several senior Legendary Digital staff members joined Critical Role during the split: Ed Lopez, head of digital strategy and operations, became chief operating officer; Rachel Romero, vice president of marketing, took on the role of senior vice president of marketing; and Ben Van Der Fluit was appointed senior vice president of business development.


=== Independent studio (2019–2021) ===
Critical Role's split from Geek & Sundry and Legendary Digital Networks was completed in February 2019. From this point, Critical Role took over production responsibility for the Critical Role and Talks Machina shows, with live broadcasts and video on demand (VOD) now airing exclusively on Critical Role's own channels. The disengagement from Legendary's streaming service Alpha led to the cancellation of Talks Machina: After Dark, which had been exclusive to the service. Some legacy episodes—including the entirety of the first campaign, the first nineteen episodes of the second campaign, and the corresponding episodes of official discussion show Talks Machina—remained available in Geek & Sundry's archives on YouTube and Twitch. Starting in December 2019, some older content was migrated from Geek & Sundry to Critical Role's channels.
On March 4, 2019, Critical Role launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a 22-minute animation called Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina Animated Special. The final total raised by the Kickstarter when it closed on April 19, 2019, was $11.3 million, allowing the intended animated special to be expanded into a ten-episode animated series. When the campaign closed, it was one of the fastest-funded projects in Kickstarter history and held the record for the most funded Kickstarter campaign for TV and film projects. In November 2019, Amazon Prime Video announced that it had acquired the streaming rights to The Legend of Vox Machina, and had commissioned fourteen additional episodes—two more for the first season, and a second season consisting of twelve episodes. The project was originally slated for release in late 2020, but was delayed until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In September 2019, Critical Role announced that it had negotiated licensing agreements with Funko, McFarlane Toys, Penguin Random House, and Ripple Junction to produce merchandise such as apparel and collectibles. On October 3, it aired a sponsored one-shot using the Feast of Legends RPG system, developed by fast-food chain Wendy's. Following a strong negative response from some fans, the Critical Role team removed the VOD, and announced via Twitter that they had donated their profits from the sponsorship. Shelly Jones, in an essay in the book Watch Us Roll (2021), speculated that the decision may have been made by the show's development team to deflect criticism about the "failed experiment". In the first half of 2020, a claim was made online that Critical Role had retained the services of a sensitivity reader, but had not paid the individual. As a result, the company called in outside counsel to investigate the claim. Whilst the investigation concluded the investigation in Critical Role's favor, the person who made the original claim tweeted that they had not been contacted during the investigation.
The coronavirus pandemic caused major scheduling changes for Critical Role Productions beginning in March 2020. This included a hiatus of four months for Critical Role itself, the launch of new remote format shows such as Narrative Telephone, and new remote formats for other shows including Talks Machina. A number of other shows were placed on hiatus. Darrington Press, a new board and card game publishing imprint, was announced by Critical Role in October 2020. In August 2021, Brian W. Foster, the host of Talks Machina and other shows, left the company to pursue other creative endeavors. This move effectively ended Talks Machina and Between the Sheets, the latter of which had been on hiatus since the pandemic. Critical Role returned to its pre-pandemic common table format with the launch of the third campaign in October 2021. In 2022, a new aftershow, 4-Sided Dive, was introduced.
A Twitch data leak in October 2021 revealed that Critical Role was among the highest earners on Twitch. The company received a total direct payout of $9,626,712 between September 2019 and September 2021 from Twitch in gross income from subscriptions and ad revenue. BBC News commented that this list of payments is unlikely to account for tax paid on income, and observed that many streamers featured in the leak are media operations in and of themselves with associated employees and expenses, meaning that the numbers may not represent actual “take-home pay”. Business Insider highlighted that Critical Role “had grown into a full-fledged media company [...] Its LinkedIn page lists employees in roles including marketing, business development, photography, editing, and even one person responsible for keeping track of the lore, or details in its fantasy world". Variety reported that, as of October 2021, the company had expanded to approximately forty employees, and that it had received no outside funding.


=== Industry expansion (2022–present) ===
In June 2022, Critical Role launched a new record label, Scanlan Shorthalt Music, to release original music inspired by Critical Role and the Exandria setting. Along with the label announcement, they released their first album, Welcome to Tal'Dorei. The new project was led by Ray and Senior Producer Maxwell James. In April 2022, Critical Role signed a multi-year deal granting Sirius XM "worldwide ad sales" for their podcast. The agreement also "calls for SiriusXM's Stitcher podcast subsidiary to distribute the show across all podcast platforms".
In January 2023, it was announced that Critical Role Productions had signed a first-look deal with Amazon Studios to create film and television series. The announcement also revealed an upcoming animated series based on the Mighty Nein campaign. Variety reported that the company would continue to produce under its production banner, Metapigeon. In March 2023, Metapigeon announced that it had purchased the space-western science fiction podcast Midst; this was the first time that Critical Role had acquired external intellectual property. The podcast was released with remastered audio and an ad-free subscription option. In July 2023, Critical Role Productions removed almost all content featuring former host Foster from its channels. Regarding the potential impact of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike on its content, Critical Role stated that it fully supported the strike and stood in solidarity with actors.
In December 2023, it was revealed that Critical Role was assisting in the development of the video game Tales of Kenzera: Zau by Surgent Studios. In February 2024, Critical Role announced that the open beta playtest of Daggerheart, the roleplaying game system by Darrington Press, was scheduled to begin on March 12, 2024, Critical Role's ninth anniversary. This playtest was available at select game stores, as a PDF, or on Demiplane via the Daggerheart Nexus. The Critical Role cast also ran a live playtest on their Twitch and YouTube channels on March 12, with a sequel playtest in May. Cheryl Teh of Business Insider said that "the crew appears to be embracing, once again, the funhouse chaos of its early-day Twitch streams". Hayley McCullough, for the American Journalism, speculated that Daggerheart may allow Critical Role "to fully sever its connections to Dungeons & Dragons and allow Mercer and the other players to use Daggerheart as their go-to system going forward". She commented that the "potential rippling consequences of such a move" is worth keeping an eye on.
In May 2024, Critical Role announced their new subscription streaming service Beacon. Sarah Parvini of The Washington Post commented that the new platform would allow Critical Role to "maintain creative control". Michael McWhertor of Polygon speculated that the company was attempting to reduce its reliance on third-party platform providers. In March 2025, CNBC highlighted that "the company has created more than 2,500 hours of original content, more than 30 original shows and published nearly 70 books, comics and novels in the last 10 years, many of which are based on the IP of its games". Also in 2025, Rolling Stone noted that the company has "roughly 70 employees, including not one but two people whose job it is to know all the lore Critical Role has developed over its three main campaigns, five spin-off shows, and more than two dozen one-shots". 
In July 2025, Critical Role announced that a video game set in Exandria was in early development through a partnership with AdHoc Studio. Then in August 2025, they announced that Brennan Lee Mulligan would take over as Game Master from Matthew Mercer for Critical Role's fourth campaign scheduled to premiere on October 2, 2025. Rolling Stone stated that "the inclusion of Mulligan is huge, but not entirely surprising" given Mulligan's background as "a well-established Game Master" who created the "titanic success" Dimension 20 along with previous comments made by Mercer on eventually shifting "into a 'Professor X' role as a mentor to the next generation of storytellers rather than remaining the face of the brand in perpetuity".


== Broadcast ==
Critical Role Productions primarily broadcasts on the Critical Role Twitch and YouTube channels. This includes both livestreaming and VOD. A number of shows were formerly broadcast on Legendary's Alpha service from 2017 to 2019. They have also broadcast episodes on their boutique subscription streaming service Beacon since May 2024. The company's two animated shows, The Legend of Vox Machina (2022) and The Mighty Nein (2025), are available on Amazon Prime Video.


=== Podcasts ===
The Critical Role podcast was announced during the 100th episode of the first campaign. It is an audio version of the game sessions. As well as the Critical Role website, the podcast is available on iTunes, Google Play Music, and Spotify. The first campaign's podcast episodes were released in batches of 10–15, between June 8, 2017, and January 8, 2018. The campaign's episodes took just over 298 hours to listen to at 1.5x speed, or around 224 hours at double speed. The podcast episodes for the second campaign were released on the Thursday after the episodes streamed on Twitch. Starting in May 2024, the podcast was made available on the same day as release, exclusively to Beacon subscribers. In an essay on live-streamed tabletop RPGs, Friedman noted that "fans [of Critical Role] often recommend that a listener supplement their experience with strategic viewing of notable visual moments".
Talks Machina was also released in a podcast format from episode 101 until its conclusion. Like the podcast version of Critical Role, there was a one-week delay between the Twitch broadcast and the corresponding podcast episode's release. The Midst podcast was released with an ad-free subscription option that included an early release schedule and other bonus content.


=== Beacon ===
In May 2024, Critical Role Productions launched Beacon, their subscription video on-demand (VOD) over-the-top (OTT) streaming service. This service hosts the company's podcasts and web series, with additional exclusive content. Business Insider's Teh compared Beacon to a Twitch subscription, but with additional benefits. Moises Taveras of Kotaku commented that in addition to exclusive programming, Beacon subscribers would get "pretty standard benefits", like discounts on merchandise, access to presales for live event tickets, early access to shows, and a private Discord server. Christian Hoffer of ComicBook.com noted that following the launch of Beacon, there was an immediate drop in Critical Role's Twitch subscribers by roughly 20%, with the assumption that this reflected a migration to Beacon.
The platform is named after the Luxon Beacons, which are in-universe fictional artifacts of religious and magical importance to the Kryn Dynasty.

== Reception ==
In March 2020, CNBC reported that since its 2018 separation from Geek & Sundry, Critical Role Productions had significantly expanded, and amassed more than 120 million views on YouTube and many subscribers. It praised its diverse lineup, speculating that it could appeal to different demographics. Emily Friedman, in the book Roleplaying Games in the Digital Age: Essays on Transmedia Storytelling, Tabletop RPGs and Fandom (2021), highlighted Talks Machina for its "informal, even chaotic space" and how it reveals "additional narrative details". Friedman called it "a mediated space where fans are names and their labor showcased through the intermediaries of Foster and Carr, who are not players but viewers of the show, and who have become beloved in their own right. Other livestreams (Game Ranch, MAME Drop) have subsequently leaned into this parasocial pleasure, allowing for more time 'with' the cast".
By January 2021, Critical Role had amassed 220 million views across its channel, with 44,000 paid subscribers on Twitch during that month. Additionally, the first episode of the first campaign was watched 15 million times on YouTube. During the final ten months of the second campaign from August 2020 to May 2021, Critical Role's Twitch subscriptions averaged around 27,000 paid subscribers. Before the premiere of the third campaign in October 2021, Business Insider reported that Critical Role's official Twitch channel had 828,000 followers and 13,530 active subscribers, while its official YouTube channel had 1.4 million subscribers. In October 2021, Variety reported that Critical Role's Twitch channel had averaged 60 to 75,000 live viewers for each episode, and that factoring in on-demand plays after the fact, total per-episode viewership could range from 1.2 million to 1.5 million. Variety also noted that "Critical Role remains relatively small compared with other popular creators and digital media properties".


=== Brand growth ===
Academic Emily Friedman highlighted that Critical Role Productions was the only entity able to recover its episodes from Geek & Sundry, and that all other shows that premiered on Geek & Sundry remained owned by Geek & Sundry's parent company, Legendary. Friedman opined that "Critical Role was as smart as Legendary was dumb. Legendary didn't make them sign a contract until Critical Role LLC had already existed". Rowan Zeoli of Rascal noted how they treated their "experimental production as a legitimate business early on" and praised the team's pre-emptive legal protections. Regarding Critical Role's success, Friedman explained in an interview with Zeoli that "you have to be lucky, but also be prepared for the luck".
On Critical Role's eighth anniversary in 2023, Christian Hoffer of ComicBook.com highlighted the brand's growth and described it as a "Hollywood success story unlike any other". Luke Winkie of Slate stated that Critical Role had fast become a "fixture of the geek-media ecosystem" and had been aided by its third-party investments. Academic Jan Švelch wrote that an analysis of the company's sponsorships "highlights the complexity of the mediatization process" and stated that both physical and digital gaming producers saw the show as an effective advertising channel. He commented that Critical Role was now "an outlier in the space of actual play where merchandising and product licensing are otherwise considered negligible source[s] of revenue".
Cheryl Teh of Business Insider considered Beacon a "daring gambit" that could cause disruption for partners like Twitch and YouTube. Tyler Chancey, for TechRaptor, compared the development of Beacon to Dropout. Moises Taveras of Kotaku highlighted that Beacon was "not quite going the way" of Dropout, which hosts all of its programming on its subscription service, but said that it had avoided the controversies of Watcher, which had faced backlash for locking future content behind a subscription before later reversing the decision. Taveras opined that Beacon was an option for "immensely dedicated Critters" that wanted to directly support the company. Tara McCauley, for The Escapist, said the contrast between Critical Role's and Watcher's respective subscription rollouts was "night and day". McCauley observed that the influx of traffic to Beacon caused temporary crashes and delays, further highlighting the stark contrast between the two announcements.


=== Open Game License ===
On January 5, 2023, Linda Codega reported that io9 had received a leaked copy of the Open Game License 1.1 (OGL1.1). Both the Critical Role: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting sourcebook and its updated edition, Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn, were published under the original OGL, which has allowed a wide range of unofficial commercial derivative work based on the mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons to be produced since 2000. The language reportedly within OGL1.1 would revoke the original OGL, and would be much more restrictive to third party content creators. Critical Role's official statement made no mention of the OGL and instead spoke of its support of the tabletop game community. The statement also mentioned supporting developers of new [TTRPG] systems. While some were disappointed by the statement, others thought it was a legally shrewd statement. ICv2 speculated that the company "likely needed to walk a fine line between not criticizing one of their biggest sponsors (WotC/D&D Beyond) while, at the same time, quelling their fan base's simmering outrage". In the ComicBook.com podcast The Character Sheet, Christian Hoffer speculated that Critical Role could be under contract to use the 5th edition system for the remainder of its third campaign, and that there may be "non-disparity clauses" preventing them from speaking out against Hasbro, its subsidiaries, and its products. In an interview with Codega, Ray stated the importance of having "an environment that does allow these creators; independent, big, small, to create and make new things. Whichever way allows the community to do that, that's where we're going to stand and support". On the draft OGL1.2 separating some Dungeons & Dragons content into a Creative Commons license, Mercer stated it was "a grandiose step in a grandiose direction".


=== Accolades ===
The Critical Role channel has won the following awards:


== Charity involvement ==
Critical Role Productions collaborated with Stephen Colbert for Red Nose Day in a special one-on-one adventure with Matthew Mercer as Dungeon Master, which aired on May 23, 2019. Fans were able to donate to the cause and vote on various elements of the adventure, such as Colbert's companion, character class, legendary weapon, and the villain. In the one-shot campaign, Colbert played a half-elf bard named Capo, who was accompanied by a bee named Eric. The event raised $117,176.20 for the charity.


=== Critical Role Foundation ===

In September 2020, Critical Role Productions launched a new 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Critical Role Foundation, with the mission "to leave the world better than we found it". Ashley Johnson was named president of the organization, with Matthew Mercer, Eduardo Lopez, Rachel Romero, and Mark Koro serving as officers and board members. Critical Role Foundation stated that 85% of donation funds would go to partner non-profits, 10% would be allocated into an emergency fund, and 5% would be allocated to administrative fees and operating expenses. The emergency fund will allow the foundation to donate contributions "in the event of natural disasters and other unforeseen events that require immediate humanitarian assistance". CBR reported that the foundation would partner with other organizations in the non-profit sector that share similar values to the show and its community.
In an interview, Johnson explained that Critical Role has collaborated with several non-profit organizations aligned with the community's values. These charities include 826LA, Red Nose Day, OSD, Pablove and OutRight International. Since the streaming began in 2015, the Critical Role community has donated over half a million dollars to these causes, according to Johnson. To ensure tax-deductible donations for donors, the team decided to establish a 501(c)(3) non-profit foundation. Johnson clarified that while the Critical Role Foundation would be closely connected to the larger Critical Role community, it would operate as a separate entity.
In 2022, the Critical Role Foundation won two 2022 Shorty Impact Awards: the Gold Honor in "Best Fundraising Campaign" and the Audience Honor in "Best Influencer & Celebrity Partnership" for its Red Nose Day campaign with Colbert titled "Choose Stephen's Adventure… Again!". This campaign raised over $423,000, which was a 252% increase over the 2019 campaign.
