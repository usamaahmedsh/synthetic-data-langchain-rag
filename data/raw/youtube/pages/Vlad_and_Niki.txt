Vlad and Nikita started their YouTube channel on April 23, 2018, prompting their father to quit his sales job to help with brands and licensing based on "Vlad Crazyshow" (stylized as "Joker"). Their videos include roleplays, vlogging, and advertising. The channel signed a representation deal with Haven Global, an Australian-based licensing agency, to develop new content, consumer products, and licenses for mobile apps under their brand. They also signed a deal with Playmates Toys, a Hong Kong–based manufacturer, to produce toys under their brand. In 2019, the brothers were judged to be the YouTubers making the most money per video at an estimated US$312,000 per video. As of November 11, 2025, they had 147 million subscribers.
