== Career ==


=== Acting career ===
Lalaine is normally credited by her first name only, later stating in 2019 that she didn't use her surname because it sounded too "Hispanic/ethnic". Her acting career began when she was cast in the Broadway production of Les Misérables in the roles of Young Cosette and Eponine. Lalaine made her film debut in 1999 as Theresa in Borderline. Lalaine co-starred with Alicia Morton as Kate in the 1999 remake of Annie. Annie aired on The Wonderful World of Disney on November 7, 1999. In 2000, she was cast as Miranda Sanchez on the Disney Channel teen sitcom Lizzie McGuire, alongside Hilary Duff. She appeared in 59 episodes until a "falling-out (that was) beyond repair" with Duff in the final stretch of filming of the television series led to her being let go early from her contract. "I don't believe that Hilary wanted her to be part of the movie," Lizzie McGuire casting director Robin Lippin said. "It probably would have been uncomfortable for both of them." As a result, Lalaine missed the last 6 episodes produced for the show, which wrapped up filming in late June 2002. Lalaine was also absent in The Lizzie McGuire Movie which filmed about 4–5 months after the show wrapped up filming. At the time of the movie, Lalaine was doing concert tours with Radio Disney and filming You Wish!.
