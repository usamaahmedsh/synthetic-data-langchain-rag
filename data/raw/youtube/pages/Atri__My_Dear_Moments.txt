== Plot ==
The game is set in the near future where a sudden rise in sea levels floods the majority of the world and ends human civilization as we know it, forcing humanity to eke a living on what little dry land remains. The protagonist, Natsuki Ikaruga, is a young man who lost his mother and one of his legs in an accident, relying on a prosthetic to walk. Prior to the events of the game, he dropped out from the academy and returned to his hometown where he reunited with his friends Minamo Kamishiro and Ryuuji Nojima. On one day, Natsuki rummages through his recently deceased grandmother's belongings to pay off a debt, only to awaken a young android girl named Atri who claims to only have 45 days to partner with Natsuki and has a task to do. Natsuki later arrives at a local school and overcomes the electricity shortage by making a homebrew water turbine. Over the course of the next few weeks Natsuki discovers that his late grandmother, an ocean geologist, had proposed artificial floating islands "Eden" as a solution to the sea level rising problem, as well as developing a romantic relationship with Atri. However, Natsuki reads through her log and reveals in dismay that all the emotions Atri shows are artificially computed by software. He eventually orders Atri to stop acting as if she had consciousness.
Unknown to Natsuki is that Atri indeed has self consciousness and possesses true emotions, despite still writing log files in old fashion. Her old owner was Shiina Yachigusa, Natsuki's mother. Shiina was constantly bullied by her classmates, which resulted in Atri assaulting her classmates in irritation. The incident soon led to a product recall and disposal for Atri's model, but Atri managed to break free and continue to protect Shiina and the new-born Natsuki. During the fatal accident, she accepted the order from the dying Shiina that transfers Atri's ownership to Natsuki, and rescued him. Soon after, she was put to hibernation by Natsuki's grandmother, who wanted her to become the central management system of Eden once it was completed. At the time of being salvaged she only had 45 days before ceasing function permanently.
News of the existence of Atri soon attracts Yasuda, student of the creator of Atri who devoted his life into research of artificial consciousness but lost all his fame and reputation due to the recall. Yasuda decides to disintegrate Atri in revenge and is confronted by Atri herself. In the bad ending of the game, Natsuki fails to stop Atri, who kills Yasuda, loses all her memories and emotions and ceases operation two days after. In the good ending of the game, Natsuki reverts his previous order, allowing Atri to express her feelings at will and persuades Yasuda. Shortly after, Natsuki takes Atri to Eden and puts her into hibernation at the central control unit the day before her stipulated obsolescence. A third ending named "True ending" takes place sixty years after Atri's integration with Eden. Natsuki marries Minamo and returns to the academy, bringing self-conscious artificial intelligence to the world. His grandmother's proposed artificial islands are also widely adopted. Natsuki, lying on his deathbed and learning that Eden will be sunk the next day, uploads his conscious to Eden. He awakens Atri in the virtualized world and decides to spend their final day together.
