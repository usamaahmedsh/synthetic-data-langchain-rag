Studio C is an American sketch comedy television show originally created by Matt Meese and Jared Shores. Produced by BYUtv, the show aims to be a clean, family-oriented comedy for a national audience.

On July 19, 2023, JK! Studios released a full-length movie titled "Go West" in Utah theaters, containing the original 10 cast members of Studio C. It was released nationally on August 11. In 2024, many of the members of JK!

Their YouTube channel has over 414 thousand subscribers as of December 2024.

Tori Pence, who was first introduced in Season 6 and later became a cast member in Seasons 8 and 9, left Studio C after Season 13 to become a full-time cast member of BYUtv's new sitcom 9 Years to Neptune. However, she still made guest appearances as a featured cast member in several episodes of Season 14. Tori then returned as a full-time cast member in season 16 through the current season.
