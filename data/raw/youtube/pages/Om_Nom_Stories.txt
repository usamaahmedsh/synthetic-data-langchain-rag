Om Nom Stories (sometimes called Om Nom) is a cartoon web series produced by Zeptolab and Rocket Fox, featuring the character Om Nom from the video game series Cut the Rope. The series revolves around Om Nom's life out of the game, and is based on 4 games in the series: the original, Cut the Rope: Time Travel, Cut the Rope 2, and Cut the Rope: Magic. The first season, as well as the first and last episodes of the second (Time Travel), combine live action and animation, while the rest are entirely animated. It ran on YouTube from 9 December 2011 to 4 October 2024.


== Production ==
On December 9, 2011, ZeptoLab released a pilot to satisfy the fans' demand for more content with Om Nom. The pilot's success prompted the production and release of the first season, which was aired from October 24, 2012 within the Cut the Rope and Cut the Rope: Experiments apps, ZeptoLab YouTube channel, and in over 19,000 US movie theatres as part of an exclusive partnership with National CineMedia (NCM)'s FirstLook pre-show.
In October 2021, it was announced that a spin-off series titled Eve and Om Nom: Delivery Duo was in development and was set to be co-produced by ZeptoLab and Russian company StoryTime. The series follows Om Nom running a parcel delivery service with his new human best friend Eve. The series' first season was ordered for 52 5-minute episodes. However, the idea has since gotten scrapped and turned into an original IP titled Eva and Tuk-Tuk: Delivery Duo, which effectively follows the same premise.
In 2022, production of the series was moved to the Metaxilasis animation studio.
Since 2025, the series is currently in limbo.


== Broadcast ==
The show has aired on CITV in the United Kingdom between 2014 and 2017. In October 2018, the series' first five seasons were acquired by Turner Broadcasting System for distribution in Latin American regions. On August 12, 2019, the spin-off short series Learn English with Om Nom started broadcasting as part of BatteryPOP broadcasts on the former Qubo network. On March 26, 2020, it was announced that Om Nom Stories would start airing on Azteca 7 in Latin America in May, and also be released on Totalplay and on LATAM Airlines’ in-flight system. On August 1, 2023, seasons 2, 4, and 15 released on Netflix. In February 2024, it was announced that the first 25 seasons of the series were acquired by Disney+ to be released in Europe in Q4 of 2024. It was later added to the platform on October 5, 2024. On June 19, 2024, it was announced that German company Your Family Entertainment has struck a deal with ZeptoLab to have Om Nom Stories released on Fix&Foxi TV.


== Plot ==
The series chronicles the daily antics, exploits and adventures of Om Nom, a friendly and curious green blob-like monster who always seems to find a way into getting himself into comically absurd situations. Most episodes circulate around Om Nom trying to relax or just have fun, only for his plans to get ruined and often sidetracked by the people around him and the adventures that he gets himself into. Om Nom is usually accompanied by his girlfriend Om Nelle, their mischievous and rambunctious son Nibble Nom, and various other miscellaneous supporting characters.


=== Super-Noms (seasons 8–14) ===
One day, a superhero in space was washing his clothes when suddenly, an asteroid crashed into his ship, causing his clothes to crash-land on earth. Om Nom and Om Nelle discover his possessions and decide to put them to good use, helping to save the world and their community against numerous villains, most predominantly an evil spider named Evil Spider who wishes to rule the world, only for the Super Noms to foil him every time. A total of 70 new episodes were produced during this period.


=== Nibble-Nom (seasons 15–17) ===
One day, Om Nom and Om Nelle are looking for danger and excitement in their superhero personas as the Super Noms, when a stork drops a package containing an adorable, yet mischievous and troublemaking child/baby named Nibble Nom whose outrageous fantasies often put Om Nom and Om Nelle at the forefront. A total of 30 new episodes were produced during this period.


=== Om Nom Cafe (seasons 18–19) ===
The Noms' cooking skills culminate with a disaster that leaves them homeless. Just when all hope seems lost, the locals enjoyment of their food prompts them to open a new restaurant called Om Nom Cafe. There, they sell food and drinks, all while invariably getting into mishaps and hijinks along the way. A total of 20 new episodes were produced during this period.


=== New Neighbors (seasons 20–26) ===
The Noms move into a neighborhood called Nomcity featuring various new and eccentric characters. Even away from Nomville, the Noms aren't safe from being caught up in numerous comical escapades and predicaments. A total of 70 new episodes were produced during this period.


=== Fantasy Quest (season 27) ===
Om Nom, Nibble-Nom, and now Evil Spider have gathered to a poker night. However, whenever they plant three cards on the table, they're suddenly whisked away to whole-new fantastical worlds with whole-new fantastical shenanigans to get up to. 11 episodes from this period were released.


== Characters ==


=== Main ===
Om Nom: Om Nom is a green blob-like monster who can seemingly never escape the madness and adventures he's thrown into at the blink of an eye. While he's presented in the early seasons as mischievous, hyperactive and rambunctious to an extent, he's later rewritten to be approachable and laid-back but somewhat slow-witted, impulsive and childish around Season 6. Om Nom is characterized most often though as being just as capable at getting himself into situations as much as he can get himself out of them.
Om Nelle: Om Nelle is Om Nom's love interest and girlfriend around Seasons 4 or 5. As opposed to Om Nom's bumbling persona, Om Nelle is considered and often is shown to be more capable, independent and mature then him and is often the one who corrects him and has to rescue him from his peril. In spite of their constant disagreements, she and Om Nom share a loving relationship with one another. Originally being a side character, she would soon evolve into one of the show's primary characters, until Season 20, where she's once again pushed to the side.
Nibble Nom: Introduced in Season 15, Om Nom and Om Nelle's son Nibble Nom characterizes Om Nom's personality in the early seasons: purely mischievous, rambunctious and hyperactive. Most of Nibble Nom's grandiose persona comes from the fantasy sequences he and Om Nom often go through, usually as a result of an ordinary family matter (Nibble-Nom having to stop playing a video game for the night and go to bed) being taken to extraordinary extents. While he's often mischievous, conniving and occasionally even sadistic, his heart is in the right place and he matures more as the series progresses, usually playing as the straight man to Om Nom's playful behavior whenever Om Nelle isn't there to fill the role.


=== Recurring ===
Evan: Evan is a boy who adopts Om Nom after he was delivered to him in Season 1. Evan loves Om Nom and is happy to take care of him, treating him like his own child.
Evil Spider: Evil Spider is Om Nom's nemesis from Season 4 to 19 and later he and Nibble Nom's friend starting in Season 27. In the Super-Noms era, Evil Spider served as the main antagonist for Om Nom and Om Nelle, usually creating new threats for them as well as new inventions. Later in the Fantasy Quest era, he and Om Nom put their differences aside and became best friends.
Nomville residents:

Professor Cheddar: Professor Cheddar is a mouse scientist and Om Nom and Om Nelle's friend. Introduced in the Super-Noms era, Professor Cheddar resides in a lab where he makes new inventions. Most of the time, Om Nom tests out some of his inventions which lead to chaos that he has to fix.
Mr. Boar: Mr. Boar is Mrs. Sheep's love interest in Season 11, and husband starting in Season 12. Mr. Boar works at a police station in Nomville and Om Nom and Om Nelle sometimes help him catch a felon in the Super-Noms era. In Season 11, Mr. Boar gets a baby daughter named Piggy.
Mrs. Sheep: Mrs. Sheep is Mr. Boar's love interest in Season 11, and wife starting in Season 12. Mrs. Sheep is usually one of the victims when a villain attacks Nomville in the Super-Noms era. In Season 10, Mrs. Sheep raised her own baby sheep daughter.
Mole: Mole is a citizen in Nomville and Om Nom and Om Nelle's friend. Mole is usually one of the victims when a villain attacks Nomville in the Super-Noms era. In Season 19, it is shown that Mole has no problem eating spicy peppers, not even the Volcano Pepper.
Mrs. Doggins: Mrs. Doggins is an elderly labrador retriever and citizen in Nomville. Mrs. Doggins has a pet kitten who usually runs away from her. Mrs. Doggins usually berates Om Nom in the Super-Noms era by hitting him in the head with her umbrella cane.
Bull: Bull is a citizen in Nomville and Om Nom's somewhat rival, known for a somewhat snooty and obnoxious personality. Bull and Om Nom are usually challenging each other to competitions. Bull gets easily annoyed by Om Nom and sometimes threatens to hurt him.
Nomcity residents:

Giant: Giant is a mountain-like citizen in Nomcity, and one of several neighbors the Noms meet in the New Neighbors arc. Like Om Nom, he is portrayed with a childlike and dim-witted personality, although also with a kind heart.
Handsome Nom: Handsome Nom is a citizen in Nomcity, and another neighbor met in the New Neighbors era of the series. He is known for showing off a large ego, even narcissism, always wanting his hair a certain way and insisting that everything that he's given must look like an effigy of himself.
Groom: Groom is a dark red-colored citizen of Nomcity. He shows off a moody personality, but shows off some impressive talent and strength and becomes fast friends with Om Nom.
