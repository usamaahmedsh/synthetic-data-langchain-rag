== Critical reception ==
In Now, Benjamin Boles wrote that this album is "less conceptually heavy but also more overtly joyful and danceable" than previous releases from The Soft Pink Truth, summing up that "it’s refreshing to hear experimental dance music maintain such a strong sense of humour and fun". Randall Roberts of The Los Angeles Times wrote that this album "harnesses [Daniels'] skill in service of house music" and calls the work "awesome". Zoe Camp of Pitchfork Media gave Why Pay More? a seven out of 10, noting that the experimental nature of the music can be "more overwhelming than engaging" but adding that sensory overload is part of the album's purpose.
