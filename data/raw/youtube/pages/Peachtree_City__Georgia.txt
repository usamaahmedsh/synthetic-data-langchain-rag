The area was first settled by first settled by Woodland Era indigenous people.

In 1957, Flat Creek was dammed to create Lake Peachtree.
In 1974, after the city petitioned the Georgia General Assembly to amend existing laws regarding motorized cart use on city streets, Governor Jimmy Carter signed legislation exempting carts from inspection, motor vehicle registration and certain other equipment requirements for motor cars. This legislation paved the way for the legal use of golf carts in Peachtree City.

Peachtree City has a system of golf cart paths which spider across the town and provide a secondary means of access to almost any destination within city limits. These multi-use paths stretch for more than 100 miles (160 km) throughout the city. Many places of business have specially designated golf cart parking spaces. The Peachtree City Police Department has several golf carts used to patrol along these paths.
Over 10,000 households own a golf cart, and use them as an extra vehicle for local transportation. Children aged twelve to fifteen may operate a cart on Peachtree City cart paths with a parent, grandparent or other guardian in the front seat. Those who are fifteen or older, with either a valid Georgia learner's permit or a full driver's license, are allowed to operate golf carts alone. Students at McIntosh High School are encouraged to drive family golf carts to school because of limited car parking. In 2015, Starr's Mill High School opened a golf-cart specific lot. The golf cart paths are also used by cyclists, joggers, and pedestrians as a safer alternative to the side of the road. In February 2003, Golf Digest magazine discussed the traffic congestion caused by the use of golf carts in the city.
