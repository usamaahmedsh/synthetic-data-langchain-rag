Ananta (Sanskrit: अनन्त, lit. 'Without end'; simplified Chinese: 无限大; traditional Chinese: 無限大; pinyin: Wúxiàndà; lit. 'Infinity'; Japanese: アナンタ, previously Project Mugen) is an upcoming free-to-play role-playing video game developed by the Hangzhou-based studio Naked Rain and published by NetEase. It was announced at Gamescom on August 24, 2023 as Project Mugen.


== Gameplay ==


=== Settings ===
Featuring cel-shaded Anime-like aesthetics, with day and night cycles, the game is set in a mystic urban open world, where each city is populated with pedestrians and foes. The game's first city, called Nova Inception Urbs is designed in a Japanese urban style. Other cities will become available later with European and American inspirations. The player can travel around the world between cities. Each city is procedurally generated by stitching multiple manually pre-designed areas, such as beaches, public or amusement parks, and factories. The character can pick up cats, play mini-games, and interact with all objects in the city especially in combat.


=== Characters ===
The player can choose to be a male or female version of the Captain as their avatar at the start of the game. They can give them a unique name and later customize their outfit and car, but their physical build and role in the story will remain mostly the same, with only be minor changes in dialogue between the two.
Outside of the Captain, the game features multiple characters across Nova City to be interacted with and even controlled by the player in later stages.


=== Mechanics ===
The player can swim in water or navigate the city by running, riding bikes or cars, climbing walls, doing parkour, grappling and swinging between skyscrapers using ropes/appendages similar to the mechanics seen in Marvel's Spider-Man and Alex Mercer from the Prototype  franchise. Traverse is fast-paced and requires no stamina. Some characters have unique traverse styles. For example, Taffy's mallet can turn into a bike she can ride. The player can take on various quests and challenges to recover lost memories and unlock various abilities that can help progress in each character's story, culminating into a final plot involving battles against the villain.
The player navigates and fights in the city as one character but can switch between a team of four characters during major battle events and boss fights. Each character has unique stats and abilities which may energize with teammates. The entire team can also equip an extra buff or major ability such as crowd control or telekinesis.


== Plot ==
The player is cast in the role of a top supernatural investigator known as an Infinite Trigger, looking into anomalies and paranormal events. All main characters and some NPCs are Espers, people with supernatural abilities. Each Esper has a unique story the player can experience, in which the character fights a force called "Chaos" that threatens humanity.


== Development and release ==
The game is being developed for PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS. It is being developed in Chinese, English, and Japanese. The developer intends to add more languages and localization options. No release date window or monetization plan has been planned yet, as the developers are focused on game design and content creation.
On November 29, 2024, Project Mugen was titled Ananta. The game was approved for release in China.
In 2025, it was confirmed that the game will not use gacha system for characters. This means players will be able to obtain characters by progressing throughout the game. Monetizable elements exist for "customizable aspects" such as outfits, vehicles, and homes; however, it is unknown if a gacha system can be used for these features.
