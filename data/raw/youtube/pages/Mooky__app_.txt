== Overview ==


=== How it works ===
Mooky used Facebook to build a user profile with photos and basic information, like the user's surname and age. From there on the user had to fill in their Mooky profile, which contains information about the user's height, posture, hair color, eye color, ethnicity and religion. After this the user could select its preferences to find matches nearby.


=== User verification ===
Mooky asked their users to take a selfie holding a piece of paper saying 'Mooky'. Mooky would then manually accept or decline the user verification.
