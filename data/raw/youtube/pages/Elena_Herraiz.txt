Elena Herraiz Medina (Spanish pronunciation: [eˈlena eˈrajθ meˈðina]; born 11 November 1992), known online as Linguriosa (pronounced [liŋɡuˈɾjosa]), is a Spanish YouTuber, linguistic popularizer and Spanish-language teacher. Since 2024, she has appeared on the TV programme Cifras y letras.

A native of Guadalajara, Herraiz graduated in Translation and Interpreting at the University of Valladolid in 2015, specializing in English and German, and went on to pursue a master's degree at the University of Alcalá, becoming a teacher of Spanish as a second language. She moved to Berlin for five years to teach Spanish.
In September 2019, she started the YouTube channel Linguriosa (a portmanteau of lingüista curiosa, 'curious linguist'), originally dedicated to sharing teaching methods for Spanish grammar, but where she now deals with linguistic doubts and focuses on Spanish language history and etymology.
In early 2024, Herraiz began collaborating on the Televisión Española game show Cifras y letras (the Spanish version of Des chiffres et des lettres), broadcast on La 2, as a language expert. She also started a joint podcast with YouTube medical popularizer Sandra Ortonobes (La Hiperactina), titled Tú de ciencias y yo de letras.
