BTS World (stylized in all caps) is a mobile video game developed by South Korean studio Takeone Company Corp and published by Netmarble. Players take the role of BTS' manager, going through various journeys with each of the seven members from 2012, before their debut, to 2019.


== Release ==
The game was released to iOS and Android systems in over 175 countries on June 26, 2019.


== Gameplay ==
BTS World is a visual novel styled video game, where most of the story relies on clicking through interactions between the user and game characters. The game is based on conversations and choices that impact the later chapters. The player can also style the characters and play a card game to achieve a specific score.
The game uses real photos and voice recordings of the BTS members. Its official website has galleries of photos and videos of the members as the game characters.
Another mode, called "Another Story", has similar gameplay but different stories, as each focuses on the player and only one member of BTS as if they were not together back then.


== Characters ==
Based on the descriptions on the game's official website, there are seven different characters in "Another Story".


== Developer ==
It was reported that BTS World was developing for two years. Netmarble claimed that the group's strong fanbase "leads to a good potential market for creating a brand-new game." The game is based on the members' true personalities.


== Soundtrack ==
The game features original music from the group. An accompanying soundtrack album, BTS World: Original Soundtrack, was released worldwide on June 28, 2019.
The soundtrack was supported by three collaboration singles: "Dream Glow" by Jin, Jimin, and Jungkook featuring British singer Charli XCX (June 7),  "A Brand New Day" by  J-Hope and V featuring Swedish singer Zara Larsson (June 14), and "All Night" by  RM and Suga featuring American rapper Juice Wrld (June 21).
