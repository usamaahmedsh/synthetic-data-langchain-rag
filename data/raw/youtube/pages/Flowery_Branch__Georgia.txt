== History ==
Flowery Branch was established in 1874, one year after the Richmond and Danville Air-Line Railroad Railway System built a rail line through the city connecting Charlotte to Atlanta. The city hosts the Historic Caboose exhibit and the Historic Train Depot museum.
Flowery Branch was originally named Anaguluskee, a Cherokee Indian word meaning "flowers on the branch". Other sources claim the original name was Nattagasska ("Blossom Creek"), which long-term residents recall as an alternative nickname for the town.
Andrew Jackson passed through Flowery Branch on his way to the First Seminole War in 1818. The historic Bowman-Pirkle House, built that same year, was originally located on the border of Flowery Branch and Buford.
Part of the historic Old Federal Road is in Flowery Branch. It was an important route through northern Georgia in the early to mid-1800s. Its most obvious significance lay in four issues: the early history of Cherokee-U.S. social, economic, and cultural relations in the early 1800s; the eventual use of the Road as part of the Trail of Tears; use of the Road during the Georgia Gold Rush; and Union and Confederate use of the Road during the campaigns for Chickamauga in 1863 and Atlanta in 1864.
Ferdinand de Soto entered Hall County in March 1540 in transit between Stone Mountain and the Conasauga River.
