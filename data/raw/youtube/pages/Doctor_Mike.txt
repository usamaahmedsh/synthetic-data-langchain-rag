Mikhail Oskarovich Varshavski (Russian: Михаил Оскарович Варшавский, Russian pronunciation: [mʲɪxɐˈil ˈoskərəvʲɪtɕ vɐrˈʂafskʲɪj]; born November 12, 1989), known popularly as Doctor Mike, is a Russian-American family medicine physician, YouTuber, internet personality, philanthropist, and professional boxer. His Instagram account went viral after he was featured in BuzzFeed and People magazine named him The Sexiest Doctor Alive in 2015. He has a YouTube channel on which he posts medically themed entertainment videos and debunks false medical claims.


== Early life ==
Mikhail Oskarovich Varshavski was born on November 12, 1989, in Saransk, Soviet Union. His father, Oskar, who was Jewish, was born in Ukraine, and worked as a physician after graduating from the Third Medical Institute of Moscow, while his mother, an ethnic Russian-Jew, was a mathematics professor. He has an older sister, Dasha, who was born in 1980. When he was five, he and his family immigrated to Brooklyn, New York.
Varshavski was given the nickname "Doctor Mike" during his high school years by friends who came to him for sports-related injuries. After seeing his father's relationship with his patients, he wanted to become a doctor. He enrolled in the New York Institute of Technology and was accepted for an accelerated, seven-year combined track for a bachelor's degree in life sciences and a medical degree (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) upon completion of the undergraduate program. During his first year in the NYIT medical portion of the accelerated program, his mother died of leukemia, and he decided to move back in with his father. In 2014, he started a residency at Atlantic Health System's Overlook Medical Center's Family Medicine program, which he completed in 2017.
He also participated in Birthright Israel, a free ten-day trip to Israel for young Jewish adults between the ages of 18 and 26.


== Career ==
In early 2012, Varshavski joined Instagram to document his life as a medical student and combat the notion that "you can't have a life in medical school". He uses his social media to provide health information.
Varshavski gained media attention in August 2015 when BuzzFeed published an article about him titled "Um, You Really Need To See This Hot Doctor And His Dog" that highlighted his good looks and his relationship with his dog, a Husky named Roxy. That November, People magazine named him "the Sexiest Doctor Alive" in its Sexiest Man Alive issue, popularizing his Instagram account.
In 2017, a year after he launched his YouTube channel, Varshavski gave a TEDx Talk on "The epidemic of the 'I Know It All' expert" at a TEDxMonteCarlo event. The video of that speech has been viewed more than 3 million times.
In 2018, after his residency, he joined Chatham Family Medicine, a family practice with Atlantic Health System, in Chatham, New Jersey.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Varshavski reconfigured his YouTube videos to answer people's questions about the virus. He debunked many of Judy Mikovits' claims about COVID-19 from the conspiracy film, Plandemic. In March 2020, he interviewed Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), about the pandemic.
Varshavski came under criticism in November 2020 for being seen partying maskless during the COVID-19 pandemic. He addressed the controversy in a response video posted on a secondary channel on November 27, 2020.
In 2025, Varshavski delivered the keynote address at PatientPoint’s annual Upfront conference, emphasizing the role of healthcare professionals in digital media.
