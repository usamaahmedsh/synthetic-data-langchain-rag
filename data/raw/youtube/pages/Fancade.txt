Fancade is a 2020 mobile video game and game engine that enables users to create games using an intuitive visual scripting system. It was developed by Swedish developer Martin Magni, best known for Mekorama, and released on April 29, 2020. Early development under an early access period started in 2017. Over time, the project has expanded with contributions from other developers and is now headquartered in Linköping, Sweden.
Fancade combines gameplay and game creation in one platform, offering user-generated games across various genres, including puzzles, action, racing, platformers, and sandbox games. It is available on iOS, Android, and web browsers, providing cross-platform support for both creators and players.


== Gameplay ==
Fancade offers a wide array of gaming experiences through its diverse game modes, including:

Quest: A single-player mode where players progress through a series of community-created games and challenges. Stars are unlocked once games are cleared, which in turn can be used to unlock new worlds with new games. Some of the most famous games include Drive Mad, Longcat, and Odd Bot Out. Quest has at least 50 unique games with 1,000 levels comprising them.
Battle: A psuedo-multiplayer mode where players compete to beat other user's high-scores on a game.
Arcade: A mode featuring a curated collection of popular and trending mini-games created by the community.
Build: The in-app game creation system, Fanscript, which allows users to design and share their own games.
You: A personalized mode where players can view their account, friends and followers, see other user's activity, and turn off music or sound.
The platform's accessible editor and scripting tools enable users to design games without prior programming knowledge. Player-made games vary greatly in complexity, from simple puzzles to intricate and highly detailed experiences. This versatility ensures that Fancade caters to a wide audience, from casual players to aspiring game developers.
