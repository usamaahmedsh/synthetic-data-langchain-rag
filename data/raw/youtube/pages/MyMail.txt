myMail transfers your username and password of your mail account to the server of the service provider. This server logs into your mail account and downloads your mail. The mobile device gets its push notifications from this Russian server. This may pose an unacceptable security risk to individuals or organizations.
Local mailserver, which are not reachable from the internet, can't be used by the app even if the mobile device is in the same LAN as the mailserver
@My.com email addresses are no longer working in some countries due to regional blocking by Russia.
