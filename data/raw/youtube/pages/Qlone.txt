Qlone is a 3D scanning app based on photogrammetry for creation of 3D models on mobile devices. The resultant 3D models can be exported for external use.
Qlone was featured at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2021. It was also featured on BBC Click.


== Qlone features ==


=== 3D scanning ===
3D scanning with Qlone requires the use of an included mat design. The user prints the mat onto a sheet of paper, then places the object to be scanned in the centre of the mat. An augmented reality dome within the Qlone app guides the user through the subsequent scanning process. The iOS version of Qlone allows scanning without the mat.


=== 3D editing ===
Qlone's editing features allow users to adjust 3D scanned models using texture mapping, polygon mesh size simplification, digital sculpting, cleaning and smoothing, and artistic effects.


=== File export ===
Qlone exports directly to multiple 3D platforms including SketchFab, i.materialise, Lens Studio for Snapchat, Shapeways and CGTrader. Models can also be exported in different 3D formats for use in other 3D tools – OBJ, STL, FBX, USDZ, GLB (Binary gLTF), PLY, and X3D.
