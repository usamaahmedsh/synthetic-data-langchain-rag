In March 2021, Emily Bowels, writing for the Library Journal, gave much praise to the book. Bowels went on to state that "Howell [...] has written a book that could be read in tandem with The Midnight Library by Matt Haig." The overall final verdict of the book given by Bowels was "Bold, raw, and powerful, Howell’s book--which also draws from his own experiences--becomes one thread of a narrative about finding hope and healing. It doesn’t ever feel too positive, simplistic, reductive, or one-dimensional. Like his previous books, this one will find a wide audience."
Glamour UK posted an extract about dealing with setbacks, calling it "essential reading" during an increase in depression and other mental health issues among adults.
You Will Get Through This Night became a #1 Sunday Times Bestseller. The book appeared on a list of the Best Books of 2021 by Barnes & Noble.
