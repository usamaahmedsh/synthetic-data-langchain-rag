Vernon Township is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located about a one-hour drive from New York City and is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 22,358, a decrease of 1,585 (−6.6%) from the 2010 census count of 23,943, which in turn reflected a decline of 743 (−3.0%) from the 24,686 counted in the 2000 census. It is both the most populous municipality and the largest in area in the county.
Vernon is home to Mountain Creek (formerly Great Gorge and Vernon Valley), a ski resort and water park as well as the Crystal Springs Resort's Minerals Hotel and Elements Spa. The Hidden Valley ski resort, which opened in 1976 and occupied a 140-acre (57 ha) property that included one of New Jersey's three remaining downhill skiing facilities, closed at the end of the 2013 season and could find no buyers at an auction held that year; it has since reopened as the National Winter Activity Center. The Great Gorge Playboy Club was located in the Vernon community of McAfee, but was sold and turned into a hotel called the Legends Resort & Country Club. Opened in 1972 at a cost of $20 million (equivalent to $150.3 million in 2024), featuring 700 rooms and 27 holes of golf, the hotel was sold to Americana in 1982 and later was resold to Metairie Corp. which branded the property as the Legends Resort and Country Club. In 2017, the township started eviction proceedings against low-income residents who had been living in the defunct resort on a permanent basis.


== History ==
The independent township of Vernon was established on April 8, 1793, from portions of Hardyston Township, and the township was formally incorporated on February 21, 1798. The 68 square miles (180 km2) which marked the town's borders over 200 years ago have not changed since. However, the population of Vernon, which was 1,548 people as recently as 1950, has steadily grown since the 1960s, when the ski industry was introduced to the area. Additional growth has come as home prices have soared in the inner suburbs of New York City and property buyers seek the better values available from real estate developments in the area.
Iron mining in the town of Vernon was prevalent during the mid-to-late 19th century. Mines such as the Canistear Mine, Williams Mine, and the Pochuk Mine created industry which spawned local businesses, and brought rail travel to the town.
It is not known how Vernon Township got its name, but a number of theories have been offered by author Ronald J. Dupont Jr.:

Admiral Edward Vernon. Dupont writes that this is very possible because of two things: 1. the township was created in 1792, the year that George Washington was reelected as president, and 2. because Vernon Township's first Masonic Lodge in 1820 was named Mount Vernon (Washington was also a Freemason during his life), likely after Washington's Virginia residence. The residence, in turn, got its name because Washington's brother Lawrence Washington served with Admiral Vernon.
A family named Vernon. Not likely, Dupont says, although he notes that a Nathaniel Vernon was a licensed tavernkeeper in Sussex County in 1756. However, the tavern was likely elsewhere, and not in what is now Vernon.
The Latin root "Vernus." One form of "vernus" is "vernal," as in vernal equinox ("spring"), and so Vernon "had connotations of spring: green, lush, fresh, fertile, etc., and hence was an attractive name for a place."
Dupont Jr. also writes that in the late 19th century two places named Vernon existed, one in Sussex County and another in Essex County. When the Essex County community was granted a post office, they found out that another Vernon existed, and so they eventually named the community Verona.


== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 69.96 square miles (181.19 km2), including 67.60 square miles (175.07 km2) of land and 2.36 square miles (6.12 km2) of water (3.38%).
Highland Lakes (2020 Census population of 4,816), Upper Greenwood Lake (3,687), Vernon Center (1,743), and Vernon Valley (1,491) are unincorporated communities and census-designated places (CDPs) located entirely or partially within Vernon Township.
The township is bordered by the municipalities of Hardyston Township and Wantage Township in Sussex County; West Milford Township in Passaic County; and the Town of Warwick in Orange County.
Elevation varies greatly due to the valleys, rolling hills, and mountains. The United States Geological Survey places Glenwood at 580 feet (180 m), McAfee at 435 feet (133 m), and Highland Lakes at 1,260 feet (380 m).
The township is located in the Kittatinny Valley which is a section of the Great Appalachian Valley that stretches 700 miles (1,100 km) from Canada to Alabama.
The City of Newark in Essex County owns 5,400 acres (2,200 ha) of land in the township that are part of their Pequannock River Watershed, which provides water to the city from a total area of 35,000 acres (14,000 ha) that also includes portions of Hardyston Township, Jefferson Township, Kinnelon, Rockaway Township and West Milford.

The township's largest housing complex is Great Gorge Village. Originally built as a slope-side vacation housing development with 1,356 units, the village is no longer affiliated with the ski resort and is operated by real estate investor Andrew Mulvihill. Village residents, who pay $5.5 million in condominium fees to cover services, have argued that Mulvihill and affiliated businesses have used their control of the community's board of directors to direct contracts to affiliated vendors.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
In a November 2010 referendum, 70% of voters approved a change from the Faulkner Act (council–manager) form of government to the mayor–council form. Under the new plan, a mayor directly elected by the voters oversees the day-to-day operation of the township with the aid of a business manager, subject to the oversight of a five-member Township Council. The Mayor and Council took office after elections in May 2011, replacing the previously existing council. The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. Under the terms of an ordinance passed in August 2011, the township's elections were shifted from May to November, with the council citing savings from eliminating the standalone municipal election.
The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the five-member Township Council, who are directly elected by the voters on an at-large basis to staggered four-year terms of office on a non-partisan basis, with either two or three seats up for election in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election. Three council seats come up for election together and the two other council seats and the mayoral seat are up for vote together two years later. Under the current plan, Vernon has a "strong mayor" system of government in which the mayor heads the executive branch, overseeing township functions, enforcing all ordinances and other regulations, appoints department heads and prepares a budget, with the assistance of a business administrator. The Township Council is the legislative branch, responsible for enacting ordinances, approving the mayor's department head appointments, can remove employees for cause and can modify the mayor's budget by majority vote, though budget increases require a two-thirds majority. The mayor has the option to attend and speak at council meetings but is not given a vote.
As of 2024, the Mayor is Anthony L. Rossi, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Vernon Township Council are Council President Patrick Rizzuto (2025), Council Vice President Natalie Buccieri (2025), Jessica DeBenedetto (2025; elected to serve an unexpired term), William J. Higgins (2027) and Bradley D. Sparta (2027).
In February 2023, Peg Distasi was appointed to the seat expiring in December 2025 that had been held by Bryan Lynch; the seat will come up for election in November 2023 for the balance of the term. In the November 2023 general election, Jessica DeBenedetto was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.
In November 2022, the council appointed Joe Tadrick to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Harry Shortway the previous month due to health issues.
In October 2021, the Township Council selected Michael Furrey to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Kelly Weller until she stepped down from office earlier that month after announcing that she was moving out of the township. Furrey served on an interim basis until the November 2022 general election, when Bradley D. Sparta was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.
The Township Council selected Toni Cilli in January 2021 to fill the seat held by Jean Murphy running to December 2021.
Andrew Pitsker took office in July 2020 after being chosen to fill the seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held until Mark Van Tassel left office the previous month. Pitsker served on an interim basis until the November 2020 general election, when he was elected to serve the remainder of the term.
Four members of the governing body were elected in May 2011 and took office on July 1, 2011, Jean Murphy was elected in November 2014 just beating Edward Dunn.
