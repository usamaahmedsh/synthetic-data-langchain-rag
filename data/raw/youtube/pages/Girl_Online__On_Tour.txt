== Reception ==
The novel was relatively well received, with most reviewers comparing the novel favourably to her debut. In a review for The Daily Telegraph, Charlotte Runcie found Girl Online: On Tour to be more mature than the previous, finding that "elements of Sugg’s own experiences... shine through with greater authenticity here" and that while the plot is "painted in broad strokes", "the bubblegum schmaltz gives way to some enjoyable coming-of-age drama", rating the novel a three out of five. David Barnett, writing for The Independent, found that while the novel deals with complex themes its treatment of them is somewhat lighthearted, stating: "it pitches to be Judy Blume and comes off more like Enid Blyton".


== Sequel ==
Girl Online: Going Solo, the third novel in the series, was published in hardback on 17 November 2016.
