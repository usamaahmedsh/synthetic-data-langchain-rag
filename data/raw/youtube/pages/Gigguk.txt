Maneetapho created his YouTube channel, then called "The Anime Zone", in 2006, using the online pseudonym "Gigguk," a nickname by which his family called him. In 2012, he created parodies of popular anime, starting with Rebuild of Evangelion into the EvAbridged series.

In November 2019, Maneetapho, along with YouTuber Sydney Poniewaz (Sydsnap), moved to northwestern Tokyo, Japan to begin working as an influencer for GeeXPlus. The effort was to help promote/introduce anime and Japanese culture to the rest of the world through his content.
In February 2020, Maneetapho joined alongside Connor Colquhoun (CDawgVA) and Joey Bizinger (The Anime Man) in creating and hosting a weekly audio and video podcast called Trash Taste, where they discuss anime, manga, otaku culture, and their experiences while living in Japan.
