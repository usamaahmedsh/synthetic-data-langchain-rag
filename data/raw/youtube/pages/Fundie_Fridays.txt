Fundie Fridays is a YouTube channel focusing on Christian fundamentalism, hosted by couple Jen and James Bryant. The channel also discusses their views on politics and pop culture. The videos are known for being "meticulously researched" and for their humourous elements. As of 2022, the channel had 90 videos. They have produced videos about a variety of religious and political figures. After their video on Bringing Up Bates, Fundie Fridays received a copyright strike and had their channel temporarily put on hold. A writer for Paste Magazine considered the filed claims to be retaliatory and as part of a larger trend of public figures attempting to silence criticism. The Bryants defended their content as falling within fair use. The channel has a fan following that call themselves "Jennonites"; many of their subscribers are also part of the "fundie snark" subreddit. Religion News Service described Fundie Fridays as a "subculture within a subculture". Jen is also known for her participation in the documentary Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets.
