== Production ==
Around January 2015 to around March 2015, filming took place in Alberta, Canada. A snow camera was used during filming.
Instead of using CGI, stop motion animation and practical effects were used, due to the budget, and to make something that felt "real and lifelike". To film the animation, they used an illuminated box with still pictures of the scenes.

The film was officially selected at the 2016 Tri-Cities International Film Festival, MidAmeriCon II, the 2016 Lost Episode Festival Toronto, and the 2017 WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival.
