From December 2015 to October 2017, iDubbbz released Content Cop episodes on a wide variety of YouTube personalities, including LeafyIsHere, Tana Mongeau, and RiceGum.
In May 2016, iDubbbz released a Content Cop video on Daniel Keem, better known as Keemstar, and his channel DramaAlert. According to The Daily Beast, iDubbbz accused Keemstar of using DramaAlert to "promote his friends and punish his enemies". In response, Keem called the Content Cop video "entertaining" and denied wanting to attack other YouTubers, saying he has "no problem booking guests or landing exclusive interviews".
In October 2017, iDubbbz uploaded a video titled "Content Cop – Jake Paul", which had over 50 million views as of May 2021 before it got removed. However, the 31-minute video was not about the YouTube personality Jake Paul, but instead it was about RiceGum. in the video, iDubbbz analyzes and critiques RiceGum in a format inspired by the seven deadly sins.

In late 2019, three years after iDubbbz's Content Cop episode on LeafyIsHere, YouTube removed the video as a consequence of the website's updated policies on harassment and bullying.
In May 2023, iDubbbz unlisted the Content Cop videos after releasing a video titled "I miss the old iDubbbz" on his main channel. In the video, he apologizes to each creator he criticized in the series (with an emphasis on the Content Cop video he made on Tana Mongeau) for harassing them and inciting harassment from his fans. He also apologized for creating "hurtful and damaging content" and "cultivating a culture of apathy and cruelty" through the Content Cop video about Mongeau, and his use of racial slurs.
iDubbbz revived the Content Cop series in April 2025, releasing an episode on Ethan Klein of h3h3Productions.
