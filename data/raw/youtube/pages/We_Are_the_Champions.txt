"We Are the Champions" is a song by the British rock band Queen, released from the band's sixth album News of the World (1977). Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it remains among rock's most recognisable anthems. The song was a worldwide success, reaching number 2 in the UK, number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, number 3 in Canada, and the top 10 in many other countries. In 2009, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and was voted the world's favourite song in a 2005 Sony Ericsson world music poll.
Written with audience participation in mind, Mercury said "We" in the song's title refers to everyone who is singing it. Brian May called the song "unifying and positive". "We Are the Champions" has become an anthem for victories at sporting events, including its use during the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and has been often used or referenced in popular culture. The song has also been covered by many artists.
On 7 October 2017, Queen released a Raw Sessions version of the track to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of News of the World. It was made from previously unheard vocal and instrumental takes from the original multi-track tapes. It also presents for the first time the original recorded length of the track, which is two choruses more than the 1977 edited single.


== Music ==
Writing of "We Are the Champions" began as early as 1975. However, at the time, Freddie Mercury deemed it unsuitable for inclusion in the band's then-current album, and the song was not recorded until 1977. It embodies numerous elements of arena rock, with Brian May stating, "We wanted to get the crowds waving and singing. It's very unifying and positive."

Musically, it is based on Mercury's piano part, with Roger Taylor and John Deacon providing a drums and bass guitar backing. May overdubbed some guitar sections, initially subtle, but building to a "solo" played simultaneously with the last chorus. Mercury employed complex and advanced harmony, including major and minor 6th, minor 7th, minor 11th, half-diminished, and diminished chords, and the choruses featured some of these voiced as four-part vocal harmonies. The lead vocal is very demanding and strident (highest point is a C5 both belted and in falsetto), with one of Mercury's most notable performances taking place at the Live Aid concert, at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985.
The single featured "We Will Rock You", which preceded the song on the album, as its B-side. The two songs were often played consecutively at the close of Queen concerts, and are customarily played together on radio broadcasts (in album order). Keeping with tradition, the two songs were also used to close the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert with all the show's acts joining in behind the lead vocal of Liza Minnelli.


== Reception ==
Cash Box said that it contains "heroic lyrics and rapid changes in dynamics and emotional intensity" and praised guitarist Brian May's "dark backing lines and rippling fills." Record World called it a "stately rocker well-suited to its title" and suggested that "it could serve as a sort of new wave anthem."


== Music video ==
The video for "We Are the Champions" was filmed at a special video shoot with fan club members at the New London Theatre on 6 October 1977 and was directed by Derek Burbridge. Mercury performs in a trademark Harlequin outfit – a half black, half white version – in front of an enthusiastic crowd who wave Queen scarves in a manner similar to English football fans. An alternate version which starts in monochrome before blasting into colour as the drums and guitars kick in was broadcast on the BBC's Top of the Pops 2 and comprises alternate footage shot on the same day.


== Legacy ==

The first sports team known to celebrate a world championship victory with Queen’s “We Are the Champions” was Team Canada’s 1978 World Field Lacrosse Championship team, which won the title in Stockport, England. The song has since become an enduring global anthem for sports victories.
In 2011, a team of scientific researchers concluded that "We Are the Champions" was the catchiest song in the history of pop music, despite its not reaching #1 in the charts in any major market. Dr. Daniel Mullensiefen said of the study: "Every musical hit is reliant on maths, science, engineering and technology; from the physics and frequencies of sound that determine pitch and harmony, to the hi-tech digital processors and synthesisers which can add effects to make a song catchier. We've discovered that there's a science behind the sing-along and a special combination of neuroscience, math and cognitive psychology that can produce the elusive elixir of the perfect sing-along song." 
The song is popular at sporting events, often being played after a major victory by the home team. For example, it was played at Highmark Stadium after the Buffalo Bills defeated the New England Patriots in the 2021 NFL playoffs.


== Chart performances ==
In 1977–1978, "We Are the Champions" was released as a single in many countries, reaching number 2 on the UK Singles Chart; number 4 on Billboard in the US; number 3 in Canada; the top 10 in Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway; and the top 15 in Germany, Austria, and Sweden.
In 1992, 1993, and 1998, the single was re-released in France, totalling 45 weeks on the chart and peaking at number 19, number 14, and number 10 during the 1998 FIFA World Cup.
