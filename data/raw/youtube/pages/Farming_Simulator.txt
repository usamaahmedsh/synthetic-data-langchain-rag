Farming Simulator is a farming simulation video game series developed by GIANTS Software.  The locations are based on American, European and Asian environments. Players are able to farm, breed livestock, grow crops, and sell assets created from farming.
The games have sold over 25 million copies combined, as well as had 90 million mobile downloads.
The game was originally revised, expanded, and re-released every two years, (excluding their newest two releases) with better graphics, a larger array of vehicles, and more interesting tasks for the user to perform.


== Gameplay ==
In career mode, players take on the roles of farmers. Their tasks depend on expanding and upgrading dated equipment and machinery, which can be achieved by harvesting and selling crops.  Players are free to explore the surrounding areas of the map, grow from their choice of several crops, and invest their money in additional fields and equipment.  They can also raise livestock or earn an income from forestry.
There are dynamically generated missions that consist of the player performing various tasks within a time frame such as mowing grass, fertilizing fields, or delivering cargo. The player is rewarded with money once the task is finished, plus a bonus based on how quickly the task was completed (excluding Farming Simulator 19,22).
Farming Simulator 14 is the first mobile Farming Simulator to have multiplayer mode. Farming Simulator 16 has Bluetooth functionality. Current generation consoles have multiplayer (Farming Simulator on the last generation consoles was the first console port of the game, with all features of 2013 Titanium). Farming Simulator 15 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One also has a multiplayer mode.

== Esports ==
GIANTS Software established an Esports league in 2019. There exist about a dozen teams, many who are sponsored by farming equipment companies. Instead of running a farm like the objective in the game series, the competitions are a 3v3 match to obtain the highest score of hay bales dropped off within a given time limit.


== Reception ==
Reception of the Farming Simulator series has been mixed across all titles, with critics praising its sense of relaxation and array of realistic machinery and vehicles. Some have criticised the games for their repetition and lack of interesting mechanics, while others argue such qualities should be expected in a simulator. Though the series targets the audience that are knowledgeable in the farming industry, the series is generally liked by both farmers and non-farmers alike.
