== Gameplay ==

In Boomerang Fu, players control food-themed characters armed with boomerangs. Players can either throw the boomerangs or use them as melee weapons. Thrown boomerangs will fall to the floor if it hits an object. Dropped boomerangs can be recalled by the player. Each character can only be hit once unless the player that got hit has the Shield powerup. The game has over 30 different arenas. To earn a point, the player or players have to be the last one standing or it can be set to earn a point for every kill. It can be played in single-player against AI-controlled opponents. The game also supports local multiplayer, allowing up to six players per match. Characters can die if they fall into water, off a cliff, or leave the arena (depicted by dotted lines) for an extended period of time. If a character dies in one of these ways, other players will not usually earn a point for the kill.


== Powerups ==
Power-ups can be picked up during matches by touching blue books, and provide permanent upgrades for as long as the match lasts. It is possible to alter it so that losing players get the shield power-up. It is also possible to set how fast blue books appear. All power-ups can be stacked except for fire and ice, which cannot stack with each other. Up to three power-ups can be active per player at one time. If a fourth power-up is picked up, a previous power-up will be lost (this does not count single-use power-ups such as battle royal or bamboozled).


== Game modes ==
There are four modes in Boomerang Fu. Only one is available in the demo.
