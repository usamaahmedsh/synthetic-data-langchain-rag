Mohammad "Mo" Shaikh is an American entrepreneur and an investor in the blockchain and Web3 industries. He is best known as the co-founder and former CEO of Aptos Labs, a Layer 1 blockchain company backed by over $400 million in venture capital.
He co-founded Meridio in 2017, a ConsenSys-backed platform for tokenizing real estate on the Ethereum blockchain. Shaikh has also worked in private equity and strategy consulting.


== Early life & education ==
Shaikh was raised in Brooklyn, New York, to Pakistani immigrant parents. He studied Economics, Psychology, and Accounting earning a Bachelor of Science at Hunter College. He later received an MBA from the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester, where he was a co-President of the Investment Club, co-President of the Simon Venture Fund, and a finalist in the Hult Prize, a global social entrepreneurship competition.


== Career ==
Before entering the blockchain space, Shaikh held a number of roles in private equity at BlackRock and worked as a management consultant at Boston Consulting Group. He also contributed to public-sector projects at the United Nations and U.S. Department of State.
In 2017, Shaikh co-founded Meridio, a blockchain platform for the fractional ownership of real estate and launched a beta version of the application in the same year. Developed within the Ethereum ecosystem and backed by ConsenSys, Meridio was one of the first platforms to tokenize real estate assets, allowing investors to purchase and trade digital shares of property. Its first project involved a fractionalized Brooklyn property at 304 Troutman Street. Meridio was eventually acquired by ConsenSys and folded into its real estate product division.
After Meta (formerly Facebook) discontinued its Diem blockchain initiative, Shaikh and former Meta engineer Avery Ching launched Aptos Labs in 2021. Built on the technology behind Diem, Aptos aimed to deliver a highly scalable, developer-friendly Layer 1 blockchain. Under Shaikh’s leadership as CEO, Aptos raised over $400 million from prominent investors including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Tiger Global, and Multicoin Capital.
Shaikh spearheaded major partnerships with BlackRock, Franklin Tempelton, Apollo, Google, Microsoft, NBCUniversal, and MoonPay, expanding Aptos’s use cases across finance, media, and consumer applications. He stepped down as CEO of Aptos Labs in December 2024, remaining a founding shareholder in the company.
In October 2025, Shaikh and three co-founders launched the $50 million Maximum Frequency Ventures (MFV) fund to provide financial and operational support for projects in crypto infrastructure, Web3, and AI networks from around the world.
