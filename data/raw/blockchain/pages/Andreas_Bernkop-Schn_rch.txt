== Biography ==
Andreas Bernkop-Schnürch was born into a family of pharmacists in Austria. He pursued studies in pharmacy, microbiology, and genetics at the University of Vienna, where he earned his doctorate in 1994. From 1994 to 1999, he served as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Pharmacy at the University of Vienna. In 1999, he completed his habilitation in pharmaceutical technology, receiving the venia docendi qualification. Since 2003, he has been Chair of the Pharmaceutical Technology Department at the University of Innsbruck. From 2006 to 2013, he served as Dean of the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy. In 2022, he was appointed as a visiting professor at the University of Bari Aldo Moro. Since 2021, Bernkop-Schnürch has been a member of the University of Innsbruck Senate.


== Research ==
Bernkop-Schnürch is recognized for his contributions to drug delivery systems, multi-functional polymers, and tissue engineering. He is the inventor and leading pioneer of thiolated polymers, known as thiomers, a new generation of bio- and mucoadhesive polymers that form disulfide bonds with cysteine-rich domains of endogenous proteins, including mucus glycoproteins and keratins. Several thiomer-based medicines have successfully completed clinical trials, with initial products targeting conditions such as dry eye syndrome now available on the global pharmaceutical market. In 2001, at the 4th Central European Symposium on Pharmaceutical Technology in Vienna, he introduced thiolated polysaccharides as novel biopolymers for tissue engineering. This innovation led to numerous products incorporating thiomers, such as thiolated chitosans and thiolated hyaluronic acid, which are widely used in pharmaceutics and biomedicine. His work on thiomer technology also enabled the creation of thiolated nanoparticles utilized in drug delivery, diagnostics, and biosensors. Among the smallest thiolated nanocarriers are thiolated cyclodextrins, introduced in 2015. These nanocarriers offer extended residence time on mucosal membranes, enhanced permeation, efflux pump inhibition, and improved cellular uptake. Additionally, Bernkop-Schnürch developed charge-converting nanoparticles for mucosal drug delivery, leveraging the membrane-bound enzyme alkaline phosphatase to trigger a change in zeta potential from negative to positive directly at the epithelium. This innovation addresses the polycation dilemma, wherein cationic nanoparticles—despite superior cellular uptake—are immobilized in mucus due to ionic interactions. Charge-converting nanoparticles overcome this barrier by altering their surface charge at the cellular interface. He also advanced foundational research in self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS), optimizing them for the mucosal delivery of macromolecular drugs, further enhancing the potential for improved therapeutic outcomes.


== Editorial boards ==
Bernkop-Schnürch serves on the editorial boards of several pharmaceutical journals, including the International Journal of Pharmaceutics, the Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology, the Journal of Controlled Release, Scientia Pharmaceutica, Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy, and the European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics.
