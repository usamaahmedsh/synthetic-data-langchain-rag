=== Chinnakada Underpass ===

The Chinnakada underpass is a public road infrastructure project for the city of Kollam, as part of the Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project. It is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to ease traffic congestion at Chinnakada, the city CBD of Kollam. The presence of an existing railway over-bridge and three close intersections with heavy traffic limits options for traffic management measures, including junction improvement. This caused the authorities to conceptualize the underpass at Chinnakada. Chinnakada is a complex junction where roads from Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, Downtown, Sengottai, Ashramam(Residency Road), Kollam Beach and the City bus stand road meet.
The preliminary design prepared for the underpass by the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC)  involved the acquisition of 0.08 hectares (0.20 acres) of government land on a temporary basis. The height of the road passage above the underpass was increased to 5.5 metres (18 ft) from 5 metres (16 ft) to facilitate movement of modern container trucks through the underpass. The underpass was opened to the public at the end of May 2015.
