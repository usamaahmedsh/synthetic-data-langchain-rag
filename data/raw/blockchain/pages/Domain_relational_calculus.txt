In computer science, domain relational calculus (DRC) is a calculus that was introduced by Michel Lacroix and Alain Pirotte as a declarative database query language for the relational data model.
In DRC, queries have the form:

  
    
      
        {
        ⟨
        
          X
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          X
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        .
        .
        .
        .
        ,
        
          X
          
            n
          
        
        ⟩
        ∣
        p
        (
        ⟨
        
          X
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          X
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        .
        .
        .
        .
        ,
        
          X
          
            n
          
        
        ⟩
        )
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\langle X_{1},X_{2},....,X_{n}\rangle \mid p(\langle X_{1},X_{2},....,X_{n}\rangle )\}}
  

where each Xi is either a domain variable or constant, and 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        ⟨
        
          X
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          X
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        .
        .
        .
        .
        ,
        
          X
          
            n
          
        
        ⟩
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(\langle X_{1},X_{2},....,X_{n}\rangle )}
  
 denotes a DRC formula.  The result of the query is the set of tuples X1 to Xn that make the DRC formula true.
This language uses the same operators as tuple calculus,
the logical connectives ∧ (and), ∨ (or) and ¬ (not). The existential quantifier (∃) and the universal quantifier (∀) can be used to bind the variables.
Its computational expressiveness is equivalent to that of relational algebra.

In this example, we're only looking for the name, and that's B.  The condition F = C is a requirement that describes the intersection of Enterprise crew members AND members of the Stellar Cartography Department.
An alternate representation of the previous example would be:

In this example, the value of the requested F domain is directly placed in the formula and the C domain variable is re-used in the query for the existence of a department, since it already holds a crew member's ID.
