Juan E. Gilbert (born February 27, 1969) is an American computer scientist, researcher, inventor, and educator. An advocate of diversity in the computing sciences, Gilbert's efforts to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the computing disciplines have been recognized by professional engineering organizations and the United States government.
Gilbert was awarded the first Presidential Endowed Chair at Clemson University on November 9, 2012.  According to one author, Gilbert's efforts "in large part" in 2012 led Clemson to have 10 percent African American computer science professors, and 10 percent of the African American computer science doctoral students in the United States.
