== Biography ==

A. Ajayaghosh, born on 30 July 1962 in Kollam in the south Indian state of Kerala, graduated in science from the University of Kerala and completed his master's degree from Calicut university in 1984. Subsequently, working under the guidance of Prof. V. N. Rajasekharan Pillai, he secured a Ph.D. from University of Calicut in 1989; his thesis was on Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis.
His career started in 1988 at the Regional Research Laboratory, presently the National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST), of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, as a Scientist and held various positions before promoting to an Outstanding  Scientist (Scientist-H) and the head of the Photosciences and Photonics Group of NIIST. Subsequently he became the head of the Chemical Sciences and Technology group He was the director of the Institute from 2015 and held the additional responsibility as the Dean of Chemical Sciences, Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR) New Delhi. In between, he was as an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Strahlen Chemie, Germany during 1994–96. He served as an adjunct professor of Material Science Programme at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Presently, he is a J. C. Bose National Fellow at CSIR-NIIST and an adjunct professor at IISER Thiruvananthapuram.
Ajayaghosh is married to Ambili, and together they have two children, one of whom is Anantharaman Ajay, known for his roles in the 2023 movie "Romancham", Gaganachari, and the YouTube channel "Appooppan and the Boys." The family resides in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala..


== Legacy ==
Ajayaghosh's research have been principally in the fields of supramolecular chemistry, chemosensors, low band-gap polymers, fluorescent gels, organic nanostructures, and photoresponsive systems and he is reported to have done extensive researches on supramolecular architecture and light-induced sensor systems. He is known to have pioneered the study of molecular self-assembly in India and is credited with the creation of a new category of self-assembled materials that are functionally soft. His work assisted in the design of larger molecular structures using self-assembling molecules and demonstrated ways to control their electrical conductivity through controlling external factors like temperature which have reported use in applications involving light harvesting, sensing, imaging, and security. He was the first scientist to design functional Phenylenevinylene-based Organogels from designed building blocks, which has been detailed in his article, First Phenylenevinylene Based Organogels:  Self-Assembled Nanostructures via Cooperative Hydrogen Bonding and π-Stacking, published in 2001. One of the commercial applications of his research is secret writing, thermally writable, non-copyable, and erasable fluorescent images useful for secret documentation by using a fluorescent gelator entrapped in a polystyrene film and the process has been developed by his team. His studies have been documented in several peer-reviewed articles; ResearchGate and Google Scholar, online repositories of scientific articles, have listed 202 and 162 of them respectively. He also holds patents for several processes he has developed.
Ajayaghosh is associated with several science journals around the world. He is an associate editor of Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP), published by the Royal Society of Chemistry and a senior editor of the Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan. He is a former member of the advisory board of RSC Advances and sits in the editorial board of Chemistry: An Asian Journal. He has also guided several master's and doctoral scholars in their studies and has been involved in programs for the popularization of science and science awareness campaigns.
