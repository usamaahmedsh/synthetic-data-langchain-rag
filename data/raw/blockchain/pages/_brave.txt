.brave is an internet domain that uses a blockchain-based top-level domain (TLD), launched by the web browser Brave in partnership with Unstoppable Domains.


== History ==
The TLD was launched in May of 2025 by Brave with Unstoppable Domains as a way to enable individualism, send cryptocurrency (including Sonic, Solana, Ethereum, Base, Bitcoin, and others through Polygon), and navigate Web3. It was offered to the users of Brave which included the ability to host decentralized websites on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) using these domains though these domains are unable to resolve on other browsers due to operations outside the ICANN-regulated DNS system. According to talks between Brave and Unstoppable Domains, they plan on registering .brave as an official gTLD with ICANN by 2026. The goal is for the domain to be compatible with both Web3 applications and conventional Web2 browsers.
All .brave domains are minted as NFTs.
