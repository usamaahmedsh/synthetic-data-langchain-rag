In relational algebra, a rename is a unary operation written as 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            a
            
              /
            
            b
          
        
        (
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho _{a/b}(R)}
  
 where:

R is a relation
a and b are attribute names
b is an attribute of R
The result is identical to R except that the b attribute in all tuples is renamed to a. For an example, consider the following invocation of ρ on an Employee relation and the result of that invocation:

Formally, the semantics of the rename operator is defined as follows:

  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            a
            
              /
            
            b
          
        
        (
        R
        )
        =
        {
         
        t
        [
        a
        
          /
        
        b
        ]
        :
        t
        ∈
        R
         
        }
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho _{a/b}(R)=\{\ t[a/b]:t\in R\ \},}
  

where 
  
    
      
        t
        [
        a
        
          /
        
        b
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle t[a/b]}
  
 is defined as the tuple t, with the b attribute renamed to a, so that:

  
    
      
        t
        [
        a
        
          /
        
        b
        ]
        =
        {
         
        (
        c
        ,
        v
        )
         
        
          |
        
         
        (
        c
        ,
        v
        )
        ∈
        t
        ,
         
        c
        ≠
        b
         
        }
        ∪
        {
         
        (
        a
        ,
         
        t
        (
        b
        )
        )
         
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle t[a/b]=\{\ (c,v)\ |\ (c,v)\in t,\ c\neq b\ \}\cup \{\ (a,\ t(b))\ \}.}
