El Zonte is a town in La Libertad Department in El Salvador. A popular tourist destination, El Zonte has been described as a "world surfing mecca". Playa El Zonte (English: El Zonte Beach; nicknamed Bitcoin Beach) became one of the first locales in El Salvador to accept bitcoin as a payment method, and inspired the country's adoption of bitcoin as a legal tender.

== History ==

When an anonymous American began sending bitcoin to nonprofits there, nonprofit workers began an initiative to start a local bitcoin ecosystem. The beach became one of the first places in El Salvador to accept bitcoin as a method of payment: President Nayib Bukele cited the town as an inspiration for the Bitcoin Law recognizing the cryptocurrency as one of El Salvador's two official currencies, alongside the U.S. dollar. In early 2025, under pressure from the IMF, El Salvador functionally reversed this policy.
Between 2015 and 2024, the average price per square meter in El Zonte rose by 134.8%, from $34.33 to $80.61 following the Bitcoin Law, and by 2025, some luxury developments are reaching prices of up to $1,058.57 per square meter.
