The EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network (EU IFIs) is a voluntary and inclusive institution open to all independent fiscal oversight bodies operating in the EU. It provides a platform to exchange views, expertise and pool resources in areas of common concern. It was formally created in September 2015 following the meeting of EU fiscal oversight bodies.
The Network supports the efforts to review and reinforce the EU fiscal framework, seeking to better exploit the synergies between rules and institutions, as well as between different levels of administration whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity and enhancing local ownership and accountability.
The network is currently headed by Sander van Veldhuizen, Chair of the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. The Secretariat is managed by the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS).
