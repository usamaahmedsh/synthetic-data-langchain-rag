This is a selected list of international academic conferences in the fields of distributed computing, parallel computing, and concurrent computing.


== Selection criteria ==
The conferences listed here are major conferences of the area; they have been selected using the following criteria:-

the notability of the conference has been confirmed by multiple independent sources; for example, it has been mentioned in textbooks or other sources, or it has received a high ranking
the conference focuses on distributed and parallel computing (instead of having a much broader scope such as algorithms in general)
the conference covers a reasonably large part of the fields of distributed and parallel computing (instead of focusing on a narrow sub-topic).
For the first criterion, references are provided; criteria 2–3 are usually clear from the name of the conference.
