In social choice and operations research, the egalitarian rule (also called the max-min rule or the Rawlsian rule) is a rule saying that, among all possible alternatives, society should pick the alternative which maximizes the minimum utility of all individuals in society. It is a formal mathematical representation of the egalitarian philosophy. It also corresponds to John Rawls' principle of maximizing the welfare of the worst-off individual.


== Definition ==
Let 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 be a set of possible `states of the world' or `alternatives'. Society wishes to choose a single state from 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
.  For example, in a single-winner election, 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 may represent the set of candidates; in a resource allocation setting, 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 may represent all possible allocations.
Let 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
  
 be a finite set, representing a collection of individuals.  For each 
  
    
      
        i
        ∈
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\in I}
  
, let 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            i
          
        
        :
        X
        ⟶
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{i}:X\longrightarrow \mathbb {R} }
  
 be a utility function, describing the amount of happiness an individual i derives from each possible state.
A social choice rule is a mechanism which uses the data 
  
    
      
        (
        
          u
          
            i
          
        
        
          )
          
            i
            ∈
            I
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (u_{i})_{i\in I}}
  
 to select some element(s) from 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 which are `best' for society. The question of what 'best' means is the basic question of social choice theory. The egalitarian rule selects an element 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
  
 which maximizes the minimum utility, that is, it solves the following optimization problem: 


=== Leximin rule ===
Often, there are many different states with the same minimum utility. For example, a state with utility profile (0,100,100) has the same minimum value as a state with utility profile (0,0,0). In this case, the egalitarian rule often uses the leximin order, that is: subject to maximizing the smallest utility, it aims to maximize the next-smallest utility; subject to that, maximize the next-smallest utility, and so on.  
For example, suppose there are two individuals - Alice and George, and three possible states: state x gives a utility of 2 to Alice and 4 to George; state y gives a utility of 9 to Alice and 1 to George; and state z gives a utility of 1 to Alice and 8 to George. Then state x is leximin-optimal, since its utility profile is (2,4) which is leximin-larger than that of y (9,1) and z (1,8).
The egalitarian rule strengthened with the leximin order is often called the leximin rule, to distinguish it from the simpler max-min rule.
The leximin rule for social choice was introduced by Amartya Sen in 1970, and discussed in depth in many later books. 


== Properties ==


=== Conditions for Pareto efficiency ===
The leximin rule is Pareto-efficient if the outcomes of every decision are known with certainty. However, by Harsanyi's utilitarian theorem, any leximin function is Pareto-inefficient for a society that must make tradeoffs under uncertainty: There exist situations in which every person in a society would be better-off (ex ante) if they were to take a particular bet, but the leximin rule will reject it (because some person might be made worse off ex post). 


=== Pigou-Dalton property ===
The leximin rule satisfies the Pigou–Dalton principle, that is: if utility is "moved" from an agent with more utility to an agent with less utility, and as a result, the utility-difference between them becomes smaller, then resulting alternative is preferred.
Moreover, the leximin rule is the only social-welfare ordering rule which simultaneously satisfies the following three properties:

Pareto efficiency;
Pigou-Dalton principle;
Independence of common utility pace - if all utilities are transformed by a common monotonically-increasing function, then the ordering of the alternatives remains the same.


== Egalitarian resource allocation ==
The egalitarian rule is particularly useful as a rule for fair division. In this setting, the set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 represents all possible allocations, and the goal is to find an allocation which maximizes the minimum utility, or the leximin vector. This rule has been studied in several contexts: 

Division of a single homogeneous resource;
Fair subset sum problem;
Egalitarian cake-cutting;
Egalitarian item allocation.
Egalitarian (leximin) bargaining.
