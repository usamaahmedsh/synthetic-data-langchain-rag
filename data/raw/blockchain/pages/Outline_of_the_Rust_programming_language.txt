The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Rust:
Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language emphasizing performance, memory safety, and concurrency. Rust was initially developed by Graydon Hoare starting in 2006, later sponsored and maintained by Mozilla Research starting in 2009, and first publicly released in 2010, with version 1.0 released in 2015.  Rust is syntactically similar to C++ but guarantees memory safety without requiring a garbage collector.


== What type of language is Rust? ==
Programming language – artificial language designed to communicate instructions to a computer
Compiled language – implemented through compilers rather than interpreters
General-purpose programming language
Multi-paradigm programming language – supports functional programming, imperative programming, concurrent programming.
Statically typed programming language – type checking performed at compile time
Systems programming language – designed for low-level programming and operating system development
Memory-safe language – prevents common undefined behavior like dangling pointers and buffer overflows


== History of Rust ==

Graydon Hoare – creator of Rust starting in 2006
Mozilla – original sponsor and maintainer of Rust starting in 2009
Cargo (software) – introduced as Rust’s official package manager and build system in 2014
Rust Foundation – current steward of the Rust project since its inception in 2021
