Bartlett noted to The Times that he retained a "significant" shareholding in Social Chain AG at the time of the second listing and that he was under contract to work for the company "on a range of strategic matters" at the time of the $600m valuation, including the up-listing to the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, for which he received a "further package of virtual shares/options".

In 2023, according to a podcast chart, The Diary of a CEO had the second largest weekly audience in the United Kingdom.
Bartlett has been described as taking a largely apolitical stance on the podcast. He has been criticized for having alternative medicine-related guests on his podcast whose assertions are not backed by, or contradict, scientific evidence, and having other guests who promote medical misinformation without any serious pushback by Bartlett. A 2024 analysis of 15 health-related episodes by the BBC found an average of 14 misleading health statements per episode, including unsupported treatments for cancer and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.
In March 2025, The Diary Of A CEO podcast won the Best International Podcast award at iHeartRadio podcast awards.

In a statement, Bartlett addressed the issue, adding: "This was a genuine oversight on my part. The posts have now been taken down."
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) took action against Bartlett in August 2022 for breaching the CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4, in which he advertised the meal replacement firm Huel on his The Diary of a CEO podcast without clearly disclosing its nature as an advertisement. The ASA ruled that the advertisement must not appear again in its current form and subsequently advised Bartlett and Huel to "ensure that they made clear the commercial intent of advertising content in podcasts in future, for example by including a clear and prominent identifier such as 'advertisement' and making sure the break from editorial content to the ad was clearly and audibly identified."
In August 2024, advertisements featuring Bartlett by Zoe and Huel were banned by the advertising standards authority because they did not properly disclose their relationship with Bartlett.
