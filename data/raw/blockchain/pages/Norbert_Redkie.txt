In 2008, at age 22, Redkie founded the Grupa Warszawa, with the intention of “creating a kiosk with vodka and culture”. After winning a call for bids, the company opened a café-bar in an inactive modernist ticket-office building of a suburban railway station Warszawa Powiśle, leased from the Polish State Railways. In 2013, Gazeta Wyborcza hailed the bar as one of the “10 Pubs That Changed Warsaw.”
In 2009, Redkie was joined by Bartłomiej Kraciuk, and Hubert Karsz in 2012. The company opened a live music cocktail bar Syreni Śpiew [Mermaid Singing] (2010–2016), located in a renovated pavilion of the former communist-party-owned hotel restaurant, and from September 2019, at the complex Praga Koneser Center.
The bar was followed by the patisserie Lody na Patyku (2012–2013), the cocktail bar Weles (from 2015), the bistro Zorza (2015–2019), the restaurant Biała – Zjedz i wypij (2016–2020), the cafe Moderna (2012–2014), the restaurant Fokim (2016–2019), and the bar Ruszt (from 2017). Between 2013 and 2015, it ran a pavilion Stacja Mercedes. Redkie also runs the art foundation Fundacja Więcej Sztuki, and the convention center Szarotka.
