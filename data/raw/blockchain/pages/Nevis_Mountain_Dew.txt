== Comparison with Whose Life Is It Anyway? ==
Both Nevis Mountain Dew and Brian Clark's Whose Life Is It Anyway? were selected as one of the ten best plays of the 1978–1979 season in New York City. Each play tackles the subject of euthanasia through the eyes of a man that has become paralyzed.  Otis L. Guernsey Jr., editor of The Best Plays of 1978–1979 theatre yearbook, which recognized the two productions that season, made the following observation:"Nevis Mountain Dew of course invites comparison with this season's British script on much the same subject, Whose Life Is It Anyway?, and the NEC variation on this theme holds its own.  It doesn't confront its invalid's question "To be or not to be?" as polemically as its British counterpart, but it takes a similar stand and a closer look at the effects of such a prolongued [sic] calamity on those surrounding the victim."


== Awards and recognition ==

1982 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award – Lead Performance (Graham Brown)
