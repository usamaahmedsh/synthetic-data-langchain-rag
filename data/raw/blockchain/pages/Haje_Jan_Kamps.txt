From 2011 to 2017, Kamps acted as the Founder CEO of Triggertrap. He is currently the CEO of Konf, a platform for small and medium-sized virtual conferences and events. On the blog of the company registered at Medium, an online publishing platform, Kamps himself stated that a permanent behavior change was expected because of the COVID-19 pandemic and that people were likely to rely more on virtual conferencing, which may have some positive effects on the environment. As an expert, he has been part of the panel of judges for the E! People's Choice Awards and the Oslo Innovation Award.


== Background ==
Born in South Holland, the Netherlands, Haje moved to Norway in 1988, and to the UK in 2001. In England, he studied Journalism at Liverpool John Moores University, and started a stint working in publishing, media and photography. In 2017, he co-launched Lifefolder, known for having launched Emily, a Messenger Facebook chatbot designed to help people with end of life planning in North Carolina. Using artificial intelligence, Lifefolder aimed to normalize talking about death and prepare for the logistics of dying. In December 2017, it was announced that the company was about to cease operations.


== Media career ==
In 1998, together with Martin Lexow Wirak, when Kamps was sixteen years old, he started Digitalkamera.no, a major Norwegian technology news website about digital photography which later evolved into akam.no.
In 2002, while working at Granada Television, on a Coronation Street specials series, Kamps started a website called Photocritic, which gained notoriety in December 2005, when it was featured on Slashdot, and subsequently got coverage on Digg. In 2011, it was cited by author Jeremy Butler in his book 'Television Style'.
The Photocritic.org website was later purchased by Sterling Publishing, and is now hosted at Pixiq, where Kamps posts regularly.
In 2007, Kamps wrote a book on macro photography for John Wiley & Sons publishing, entitled Macro Photography Photo Workshop (ISBN 978-0470118764). He has worked at Future Publishing as a web editor and for Fast Car Magazine and T3 magazine as well. He later started working as a senior producer at Five, the UK-based TV channel. At Five, Kamps was the senior producer of the FiveFWD website.
Since then, Kamps is known for working as a freelance ghostwriter and media editorial consultant. He has also acted as a guest in different photography competitions. In 2011, he created Triggertrap, which was his main occupation until 2017, when the company ceased operations.


== Product development ==
In 2011, Kamps created the Triggertrap universal camera trigger, a device based on the Arduino rapid prototyping platform. The Triggertrap was known for connecting cameras to various sources (light, laser, sound, or any other arbitrary source), and can be used to trigger the camera on a certain event. The Triggertrap project was crowd-funded via the Kickstarter platform in July 2011, raising $77,262 - more than 3 times over its original $25,000 goal.
In November 2013, the Triggertrap Ada was crowd-funded via Kickstarter, raising £290,386 though the original goal was £50,000. On 2 March 2015, Triggertrap announced that they had failed to bring the product into production and that only the remaining 20% of the funds from the Kickstarter campaign would be returned to the original backers.
