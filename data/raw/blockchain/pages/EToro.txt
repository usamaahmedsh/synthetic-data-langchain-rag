== History ==
eToro was founded as RetailFX in 2007 in Tel Aviv, by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia together with David Ring. In 2010, the firm released the eToro OpenBook social investment platform. This included the copy trading feature, enabling users to replicate the trading strategies of top-performing investors automatically. Later that year, the firm released an Android app.
Between 2007 and 2013, the company raised $31.5 million across four funding rounds. By December 2014, it had secured an additional $27 million from Russian and Chinese investors.

In 2013, eToro expanded its product range, allowing investments in stocks and CFDs alongside commodities and currencies, with an initial offering of 110 stocks that later grew to over 3,000 financial products. The same year, it was authorized to provide services in the UK under its eToro UK subsidiary. By 2014, some referred to eToro as "Israel's biggest export." In January 2014, the company added cryptocurrencies to its available instruments, and later that year, it introduced currency futures investments for the Russian ruble and Chinese yuan.
In December 2017, eToro partnered with CoinDash to develop blockchain-based social trading. The following year, it raised $100 million in private funding, bringing total investment to over $162 million from various firms.
In March 2019, eToro acquired Danish blockchain company Firmo.

In March 2019, the company launched its cryptocurrency trading platform and standalone cryptocurrency wallet for US users.
Financially, 2020 proved a landmark year for eToro, with a 147% year-over-year growth, a 275% increase in funded accounts, and a gross revenue of $605 million. The company reported 1.2 million funded accounts, managed by a team of 1,100 employees worldwide. That year, eToro also acquired Marq Millions, its UK e-money division, rebranding it as eToro Money, and obtained Visa's primary membership along with an electronic money institution (EMI) license from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.

In March 2021, eToro announced plans to go public via a merger with FinTech Acquisition Corp V (NASDAQ:FTCV), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by former Bancorp CEO Betsy Z. Cohen. The combined entity was expected to operate as eToro Group Ltd with an implied enterprise value of $10.4 billion, supported by $650 million in funding from private investment funds. However, due to market instability and internal challenges within the SPAC, including "material weaknesses" in its financial controls, the deal was canceled by mid-2022. By that time, eToro had invested heavily in preparation for the IPO, contributing to a net loss of $265 million for 2021. Following the cancellation, eToro implemented cost-cutting measures, including laying off approximately 100 employees, or around 6% of its workforce, to stabilize its finances.

=== Misleading advertising in Italy, 2023 ===
In 2023, the Italian Competition Authority fined eToro €1.3 million for misleading advertising. The Authority found that eToro's Italian website promoted zero-commission share trading but did not disclose various costs and financial risks, such as currency exchange fluctuations and operational limitations on customer rights. These omissions led consumers to make choices they might not have otherwise made, in violation of Articles 20, 21, and 22 of the Italian Consumer Code.

As of November 2024, court proceedings have been postponed eight times.

=== The Times of Israel investigation ===
In July 2021, The Times of Israel published an investigation on eToro, exposing dozens of cases of staffing connections between eToro and Israel's largely fraudulent binary options industry. For example, Shmuel Hauser, former chairman of the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), joined eToro as an advisory board member after overseeing regulatory decisions that impacted the company. During Hauser's ISA tenure from 2011 to 2017, he agreed to modify a Knesset bill that would have restricted eToro's operations, which allowed eToro to continue expanding internationally. Although eToro did not engage in binary options, a sector under heavy scrutiny for fraudulent practices, the modified bill exempted companies like eToro from stricter regulations. In the same year, he resigned from his post at ISA amidst several high-profile anti-corruption scandals. After leaving the ISA, Hauser began advising eToro on regulatory issues worldwide. In 2021, Hauser became an advisory board member at eToro. At the same year, eToro announced that it had appointed Hedva Ber, former supervisor of banks at the Bank of Israel, in 2021 was appointed deputy CEO and global COO. 
The Times of Israel also covered the story of Nir Barkat, Likud MK and former mayor of Jerusalem. Barkat was linked to eToro in the "Pandora Papers", revealing he held shares in the company, which is registered in the Virgin Islands despite most operations being based in Israel. While mayor, Barkat claimed his assets were under a blind trust, but leaks indicated they remained in his name until he transferred them to his brother upon joining the Knesset in 2019, contrary to Knesset Ethics Committee guidelines. In 2019, Barkat's net worth was valued at $139 million.
