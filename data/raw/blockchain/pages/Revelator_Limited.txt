== History ==


=== Background ===
Revelator was founded by Bruno Guez, a Paris-born, Los Angeles–raised music executive whose career in the music industry began in the early 1990s. Before launching Revelator, Guez founded the independent label Quango Music Group in partnership with Chris Blackwell, releasing artists including Zero 7, Tricky, Sneaker Pimps, Basement Jaxx, and Kruder & Dorfmeister.


=== Founding and early development ===
In response to the rapid transformation brought by digital streaming, Guez identified the need for improved tools to manage rights, royalties, metadata, and financial transparency for artists and rights holders. After relocating to Israel, he began developing a cloud-based data infrastructure that evolved into Revelator's platform. The company was formally incorporated in 2012.


=== Funding ===
In 2015, Revelator raised US$500,000 in seed funding. In 2016, the company secured a US$2.5 million Series A round led by Exigent Capital with participation from Digital Currency Group and Reinvent.
In 2022, Revelator's Web3 platform Original Works secured investment from Dapper Labs, creators of the Flow blockchain.
