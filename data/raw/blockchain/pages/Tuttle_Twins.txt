Tuttle Twins is an American educational animated series distributed by Angel Studios and produced by Tuttle Twins Show LLC, based on the book series of the same name by Connor Boyack. First released on June 30, 2021, the series follows twin siblings Ethan and Emily Tuttle, who travel through space and time with their grandmother Gabby to meet historical figures and learn lessons about topics related to libertarianism and anti-communism.
On May 2025, it was announced that the series would be added to Argentina's public children's network Pakapaka under President Javier Milei to promote free market economics.


== Premise ==
The series involves 11-year-old Cuban-American twin siblings Ethan Tuttle and Emily Tuttle and their grandmother Gabby. In most episodes, Gabby uses a modified wheelchair to take the twins, a raccoon named Derek, and (in Season 3) a robot named Ro-Burt on adventures (often through time) in which they meet famous individuals, historical figures, or other characters and learn lessons in order to fill the fuel container on Gabby's wheelchair with a liquid substance called "knowledge juice" so they can return home.


== Characters ==


=== Main ===
Ethan Tuttle (voiced by Jonny Vance) is Emily's twin brother and Gabby's grandson. In several episodes, it is mentioned that he has IBS.
Emily Tuttle (voiced by Alex Hall in half of season 1, Sara Johnson in seasons 1-3) is Ethan's twin sister and Gabby's granddaughter.
Gabby (voiced by William Lucas) is Ethan and Emily's maternal grandmother. She is a first-generation Cuban-American. She uses a wheelchair time machine to take herself, her twin grandchildren, and her raccoon Derek to different time periods, and in some cases, different dimensions. Her full name is Gabriella Villanueva De Los Santos Ron Pablo Jones.
Derek (voiced by Alex Elkin) is a raccoon who accompanies Ethan, Emily and Gabby on their time-traveling adventures. In a few episodes, he makes appearances as a superhero named Dark Dumpster Derek. In "Wonky Wages", the Tuttles see a younger version of Gabby find what appears to be a younger version of Derek in Havana, Cuba in 1940, although Gabby explains that the raccoon she had found back then was "a different Derek". In "Kidnappers & Capitalism", Derek is revealed to be an alien who was supposed to run for president on his original home planet with the help of an intelligence-enhancing substance that he was supposed to drink.
Roburt (or Ro-Burt) (voiced by Christopher Pinesworth) is a robot built by the Tuttles that makes his first appearance in "The College Conundrum".


=== Recurring ===
Copernicus (voiced by Blake Brust) is a friend of the Tuttle twins who is characterized as not being the brightest.
Karinne (voiced by Natalie Madsen) is the series' main antagonist. She regards Karl Marx as her idol, and her red uniform is a reference to the flags of communist countries. It is implied in some episodes that she secretly has feelings for Ethan, which she denies.
Mr. Tuttle (voiced by Corey Landis) is Ethan and Emily's father.
Mrs. Tuttle (voiced by Rachel Strauss-Muniz) is Ethan and Emily's mother.

=== Use in Argentina ===
In May 2025, the administration of Argentine President Javier Milei announced that the first two seasons of Tuttle Twins would air on Pakapaka, the county's state-run children's television network, for a reported sum of $8,000. The government described the move as part of an effort to teach the country's youth about free market principles.
This was one of the first instances of the series being adopted as part of a country's national public media. However, as of July 2025, there are no traces of the show on Pakapaka's programming schedule.
