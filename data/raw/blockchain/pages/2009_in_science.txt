5 February – 28 individual fossils of the giant prehistoric snake T. cerrejonensis are discovered in the coal mines of Cerrejón, La Guajira, Colombia.
10 February – 2009 satellite collision: The first accidental hypervelocity collision between two intact satellites in low Earth orbit takes place when Iridium 33 and Kosmos 2251 collide and destroy each other over Siberia.
24 February – Comet Lulin, a non-periodic comet, makes its closest approach to Earth, peaking in brightness between magnitude +4 and magnitude +6.
Iranian scientists find that the way in which traditional timber-framed constructions are built makes them earthquake-resistant.


=== March ===
7 March – The Kepler space observatory is successfully launched, and begins its search for exoplanets.
12 March – Dartmouth researchers have found a way to develop more robust “quantum gates,” which are the elementary building blocks of quantum circuits.

4 April – A new method developed by Cornell biological engineers offers an efficient way to make proteins for use in medicine or industry without the use of live cells.
5 April – Japanese engineers build a childlike robot, the Child-robot with Biomimetic Body, or CB2, and report that it is slowly developing social skills by interacting with humans and watching their facial expressions, mimicking a mother-baby relationship.


=== May ===
11–24 May – STS-125, the last Space Shuttle mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope, takes place.
19 May – Paleontologists announce the discovery of Darwinius masillae, an evolutionary "missing link" with features similar to lemurs, monkeys, and humans.


=== July ===
22 July – A total solar eclipse – the longest-lasting total eclipse of the 21st century – takes place.
23 July – Two teams of Chinese researchers create live mice from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.


=== September ===
3 September – Saturn's rings cross the plane of the Earth's orbit. This was the first such crossing since May 22, 1995, and another will not occur until March 23, 2025.
29 September – NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft makes its final flyby of Mercury, decreasing velocity enough for its orbital capture in 2011.


=== October ===
1 October – Paleontologists announce the discovery of an Ardipithecus ramidus fossil skeleton, deeming it the oldest fossil skeleton of a human ancestor yet found.
20 October – European astronomers discover 32 new exoplanets.


=== December ===
31 December
A partial lunar eclipse is visible from most of Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
Sleeping Beauty Transposase SB 100X is announced as the Molecule of the Year 2009 by Isidro A. T. Savillo, President of the International Society for Molecular and Cell Biology and Biotechnology Protocols and Researches (ISMCBBPR).
