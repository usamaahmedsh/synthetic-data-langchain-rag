On January 26, 2003, the day of Super Bowl XXXVII, Milonakis decided not to attend a friend's Super Bowl party and instead recorded a video titled "The Super Bowl Is Gay".

From 2014 to 2015, Milonakis hosted and starred in a cooking show called "Fat Prince" on Munchies, a YouTube channel that is part of the Vice network. In each episode, he and a changing cast of chefs combined cheap ingredients with expensive ingredients to make a unique meal.
