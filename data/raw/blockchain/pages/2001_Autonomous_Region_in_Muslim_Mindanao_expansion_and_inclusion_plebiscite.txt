The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was the only autonomous region in the Philippines, until it was superseded by Bangsamoro; as such it is the sole region with a regional government as prescribed by the Constitution of the Philippines. In 2001, Republic Act No. 9054 was passed for the expansion of the region by including the areas which initially rejected inclusion and the provinces which were carved from them. However, only the city of Marawi and the province of Basilan, with the exception of Isabela, opted to be integrated in the region.
A special plebiscite was set on August 14, 2001.


== Results ==


=== Rules ===
Each province, and their component cities, has their own separate plebiscite. In order for the plebiscite to be approved, a majority of the people who voted is needed, if it fails to surpass the majority of valid votes, the plebiscite is defeated in that province or city.

For provinces voted for expansion and amendments to the original organic act:
If a majority did not vote in favor, all amendments to the organic act, save for provinces and cities that voted for inclusion, are rejected.
For provinces and cities voting for inclusion:
If a majority in each city or province votes in favor, it becomes a part of the autonomous region; in case of component cities, they do not cease to be a part of their province but regional services will be under the ARMM.
If a majority in a municipality does not vote in favor of inclusion but the totals for the rest of the province are in favor it will be a part of the ARMM nevertheless.
Provinces and cities that approved expansion (for already members) and inclusion (for non-members) are highlighted:


=== Summary ===
Support from within the ARMM was overwhelmingly in favor, with all four provinces having at least 70% of those who voted in favor of expanding the region. Those which were asked for inclusion, on the other hand, were overwhelmingly opposed, with most provinces and cities having more than 90% of those who voted opposing inclusion, with the exception of Basilan (91%), which voted overwhelmingly for inclusion (its capital Isabela City voted not to be included) and Marawi (which is part of Lanao del Sur which already within the ARMM).
