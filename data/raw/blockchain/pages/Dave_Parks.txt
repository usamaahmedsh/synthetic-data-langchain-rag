Parks played at the college level for the Texas Tech Red Raiders in 1961–1963. While at Texas Tech, Parks set several school records and earned many accolades. During his junior season in 1962, Parks was named an All-Southwest Conference selection.
Following his final season in 1963, Parks became the first player in Texas Tech history to be named an Associated Press All-American, and also earned selections from Sporting News, Time, Boston Recorder-American, Sports Extra, the American Football Coaches Association, and Football Weekly.

Parks was the first overall selection of the 1964 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He was one of only three people to be drafted No. 1 as a wide receiver, alongside Irving Fryar in 1984 and Keyshawn Johnson in 1996. Six games into his rookie season, Parks set a franchise record for longest reception with an 83-yard catch, followed by the team's second longest reception, an 80-yarder, a week later. Both records stood for 13 years. In 1965, he achieved the receiving triple crown, leading the National Football League in receptions with 80, receiving yards with 1,344, and receiving touchdowns with 12. For his performance, he was selected to the 1965 Pro Bowl and was named to the 1965 All-Pro Team. He was named to the 1966 All-Pro Team and went on to attend the 1966 Pro Bowl and the 1967 Pro Bowl.
After playing his option year with the 49ers in 1967, Parks signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Saints in 1968. In the second of only four times the NFL exercised the Rozelle rule, the 49ers received Kevin Hardy and a 1969 first-round selection (7th overall–Ted Kwalick) as compensation. He spent five seasons with the Saints.
In 1973, he played for the Houston Oilers, and retired after the season. He ended his career with 360 receptions, 5,619 receiving yards, a 15.6 average, and 44 touchdowns.
