Olég Figóvsky  (Hebrew: אולג פיגובסקי; born April 9, 1940) is an Israeli inventor who has made or overseen over 500 inventions (in the USSR, invention was the equivalent of a patent, see Изобретение (право) (in Russian).
In 1982, he developed the first nanostructured anticorrosive composite materials based on LG-matrix, where nanoparticles are forming during technological process by hydrolysis of TFS (Tetra-furfuril-oxy-silane). Several nanotechnologies invented and developed by Figovsky successfully have reached industrial production in the US, Canada, China, Mexico, Russia and Israel.
He has served as the chairman of the UNESCO "Green Chemistry," the President of Israeli Association of Inventors (IAI), founder and director of International Nanotechnology Research Center Polymate (1998–2018), Director of R&D at Eurotech, Ltd. (1998–2008).


== Biography ==
Oleg Figovsky was born on 9 April 1940 in Moscow into a family of engineers. Interested in physics, chemistry and science from early school years, Oleg had a hard time getting into university of his choice. Not for a lack of talent, he was hindered by State-imposed anti semitic limitations, which were based only on the fact of a young person being a Jew, and did not consider abilities and school grades. Despite that obstacle Oleg managed to get a bachelor's degree in chemistry from another University. His scientific career began when he was 18 at NII Mosstroy, Moscow Building Research Institute. Back then his first invention was "Nanoasphalt Concrete". At the age of 20 he presented his first scientific report at the seminar of Professor Davidov, Vice President of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences.
He graduated from the Faculty of Technology of VZISI (USSR Civil Engineering Institute, now MGAKHIS) what would be equivalent to a Master of Science Degree and continued working while studying at NII Mosstroy. During this period, he wrote "Polyether and Polyurethane Resins in Construction" and created more than 25 inventions, including industrial and construction adhesive "Bustilat", which later became hugely popular and got mass-produced by more than 20 companies of the Soviet Union.
After graduation Professor Figovsky joined the corrosion protection laboratory of USSR Research Institute "Teploproekt" and established a scientific school on the chemical resistance of non-metallic materials. After writing his Candidate's thesis (Ph.D. equivalent), he joined the Central Research Institute for industrial buildings of USSR State Building Committee, where he developed a series of original compositions and designs for monolithic flooring, published two books on the floors of industrial buildings and created over 40 inventions in the field of materials for corrosion protection.
In 1981 Professor Figovsky became the head of the non-metallic materials department at the Interdisciplinary Scientific Research Complex "Anti-Cor" of the State Committee for Science and Technology (USSR), where he was especially interested in development of materials for extreme conditions, including those for the nuclear and space industries. In 1982 he has developed the first nanostructured anticorrosive composite materials based on LG-matrix, where nanoparticles are forming during technological process by hydrolysis of TFS (Tetra-furfuril-oxy-silane). He subsequently created high heat resistant and flame retardant composites for the aerospace industry.
He is the author of the work "The Anticorrosion Service of Industrial Buildings"; Professor Figovsky created more than 50 inventions, a significant part of which was adopted by industries. At the same time, he taught at the Organic Building Materials and Plastics Department at the Moscow Institute of Civil Engineering and supervised a number of Ph.D. students. In 1986 he became the head of the Corrosion Protection Department at the USSR Chemical Industry Research Institute and at the same time acted as Deputy Director of the institute responsible for coordination of all corrosion protection works in that ministry. While working there he published several reviews on corrosion protection techniques and created more than 50 inventions, as well as his Doctor of Science thesis (Final academic Degree in USSR).
Since 1991, Oleg Figovsky has been working in Israel, first as a deputy director of the Israel Corrosion Research Institute (Ramat HaSharon) and director of the Polyadd Technology Company (Nazareth Illit, now Nof HaGalil), publishing his works frequently in European and American scientific journals and speaking at international conferences, mostly in the field of special purpose composites. In 1998 Oleg Figovsky founded Polymate research center (Migdal HaEmek), where new materials and production methods are designed, the focus is mainly on nanotechnology processes. In recent years, he has received more than 30 patents (mostly from the US) and published more than 50 original scientific papers, including 3 articles in the Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science (USA).
In 2014 two monographs by him were published - "Advanced Polymer Concretes and Compounds" (USA) and "Nanomaterials Based on Soluble Silicates" (Germany), and in 2017 "Green Nanotechnology" (USA) got published. He is a member of the European Academy of sciences. He is also president of the Israeli Association of Inventors (IAI), foreign academician of RAASN and REA (Russian academies of sciences), Honorary Professor and Doctor in 5 universities in Poland and Russia, head of the UNESCO Chair “Green Chemistry” and member of the International Scientific Council of the Russian Peoples' Friendship University in engineering sciences.
The new nanotechnologies invented by Prof. Figovsky became the foundation for several industrial productions in the US, Canada, China, Mexico, Russia and Israel. For his inventions in nanotechnologies, he was awarded gold and silver medals at IENA-98 and the Gold Angel Prize (Nuremberg, Germany).
1999–2019 he was the Editor-in-Chief of the "Innovations in Corrosion and Materials Science" Journal. Since 2008 he has been the Editor of the Open Corrosion Journal, and since 2014 of the RPCS – journal (USA). He is a member of the editorial board of 5 international journals. He is a member of the editorial board of the journal “Nauka i Zhizn Izrailya”. His three-volume monograph on innovation systems was published in 2019–2021. Oleg Figovsky has more than 520 patents for his inventions.
