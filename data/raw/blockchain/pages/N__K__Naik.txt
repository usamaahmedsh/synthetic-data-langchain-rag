== Biography ==
Naik was born in Agragone, Ankola Uttara Kannada. With 42 years of experience as a faculty in Aerospace Engineering Department, he has made major contributions to teaching, research and development at IIT Bombay. Currently, he is Professor Emeritus. He is B. E. in Mechanical Engineering from Engineering College, Gulbarga and M.Tech. and Ph.D. from IIT Bombay.
The discipline "Polymer Matrix Composites" was evolving and attracting the attention of engineers and scientists about 4 decades ago. That was the time when Naik actively involved in composites research at IIT Bombay. His main fields of research are: 2D / 3D textile composites; ballistic impact / low velocity impact and fatigue and fracture of composites; high strain rate behavior of materials and hybrid composites.
For multi-directional and out-of-plane loading cases, textile composites are widely used as high performance structural materials. Considering the importance of this subject, many investigations are being carried out to understand the behavior of textile composites under different loading conditions during the last four decades. Naik is one of the researchers on this subject and contributed significantly to the textile composites research.
He has presented analytical methods to the scientific community for elastic and thermal analysis of different 2D / 3D textile composites. He has also presented analytical methods for the failure analysis under different loading conditions. His other major contributions are the development of new and efficient methods for the analysis of composite structures under low velocity impact, ballistic impact and fatigue loading.

His research papers have been published in many archival journals. He has written a book on "Woven Fabric Composites" published by Technomic, USA.  He has also contributed chapters to the books published by Blackie Academic and Professional, London; Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York and Woodhead Publishing Limited, Cambridge, U.K.
Naik's research publications are well cited in literature. It is evident from Web of Science and Scopus. He has completed several sponsored and industrial projects of national importance. He has interacted with several national and international organizations. In recognition of his contributions, many research and education awards have been conferred upon him.
