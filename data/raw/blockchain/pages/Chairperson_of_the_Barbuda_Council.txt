The Chairperson of the Barbuda Council is the leader of the Barbuda Council. Established by the Barbuda Local Government Act of 1976, the first council election was on March 22, 1979.


== Role ==
The council's members vote for the chairperson. Every January or at the first council meeting following an election, the chair is chosen. The representative representing Barbuda in the House of Representatives is in charge of the council meeting when a chairperson is being chosen. The members elect a Chairman, as the case may be, to fill the vacancy caused if the Chairman resigns, dies, or is otherwise ineligible to serve on the Council during its term.
