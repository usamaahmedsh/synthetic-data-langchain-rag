NaijaHacks is a hackathon and tech invention competition in Nigerian, which aims to encourage youth to use technology to create solutions for their communities and the world using technologies including blockchain and artificial intelligence. Officially, NaijaHacks is described as an official national "Movement of Makers, Leaders, and Disruptors".
Founded in 2018 by software engineer Uchi Uchibeke (formerly of Shopify and founder of AfricaHacks),  NaijaHacks is Africa's largest hackathon. NaijaHacks is inspired by Uchi's experience attending Major League Hacking and other hackathons at Stanford, Harvard, Princeton and others.
In 2018, NaijaHacks had 500 participants with 100 projects, and in 2019 NaijaHacks became the largest hackathon in Africa with over 200 projects submitted.
