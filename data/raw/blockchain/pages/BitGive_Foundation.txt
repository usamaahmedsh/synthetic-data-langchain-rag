== Background ==
BitGive was established by Connie Gallippi in 2013. The organization was the first Bitcoin and Blockchain technology nonprofit. The organization has received 501(c)(3) tax exempt status from the United States Internal Revenue Service.

The platform gives donors financial reporting and project results in real time.
In 2017–2018, BitGive received $1 million from the Pineapple Fund, a philanthropic endeavor by an anonymous donor known as “Pine,” who sought to donate “the majority of [their] bitcoins to charitable causes.”
