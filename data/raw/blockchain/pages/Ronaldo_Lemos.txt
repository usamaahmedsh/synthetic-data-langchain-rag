== Main Legislative Contributions in Brazil ==


=== Marco Civil da Internet ===
Recognized as the creator and main advocate of the Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet (Marco Civil da Internet), Ronaldo Lemos played a central role in the initiative that led to the legal regulation of users' rights and responsibilities on the internet in Brazil, through Law No. 12,965/2014. In 2007, he established a partnership with the Secretariat for Legislative Affairs of the Ministry of Justice, through which he developed an innovative model of public participation in the drafting of legislation via online public consultations. Based on contributions received during the public consultation process between 2009 and 2010, he drafted the first version of the bill, which was later enacted in 2014.


=== First Artificial Intelligence Law in Brazil, State of Goiás ===
Lemos led the drafting of the first state and country-level legislation on artificial intelligence in Brazil, approved in May 2025 by the State of Goiás. The proposal was developed through a public consultation coordinated by the Institute for Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro (ITS Rio) and Abranet, with Lemos serving as the chief coordinator. Key points of the new law include prioritization of open source AI models, the integration of AI education into public school curricula, and incentives for the use of renewable energy in data center operations.


=== Rare Earths and Critical Minerals Law of the State of Goiás ===
He was the architect and driving force behind the law on rare earth elements, critical minerals, and remineralizers approved by the State of Goiás (Law No. 23,597/2025). The legislation established the State Authority for Critical Minerals (AMIC/GO). Considering Goiás’ abundance of rare earth elements and critical minerals such as niobium, neodymium, dysprosium, yttrium, among others, the law implemented tools for the strategic development of these resources. Among them are the creation of the State Fund for the Development of Critical Minerals (FEDMC), the establishment of Special Zones for Critical Mineral Mining (ZEMCs), and the financing of technological innovation and local infrastructure projects.


=== National Internet of Things Plan ===
In 2016, in partnership with McKinsey & Company and the Center for Research and Development in Telecommunications (CPqD), Lemos initiated actions to formalize Brazil's National Internet of Things Plan. The project was carried out through an agreement between the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (NBESD) and the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTI).  The resulting report, co-authored by Lemos, was published in May 2018 on the NBESD website and, after being submitted to the Office of the Chief of Staff, was established by Decree No. 9,854/2019.


=== General Data Protection Law (LGPD) ===
Lemos was actively involved in advocating for the implementation of Brazil's General Personal Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais – LGPD), a proposal originally conceived by professor and lawyer Danilo Doneda. He coordinated the academic team that supported the federal government in collecting public input on the bill, which was ultimately enacted in 2018.


=== Creative Commons Licenses ===
In 2004, Lemos led the project that introduced Creative Commons licensing in Brazil, providing creators with various options for licensing their intellectual property. He was responsible for translating and adapting version 2.0 of the licenses to Brazilian law, making Brazil the third country in the world to adopt the model. In 2010, he also translated and formalized version 3.0 of the licenses.


=== Free Software Licenses for the Federal Government ===

Also in 2004, Lemos contributed to the development of licensing models used by the Brazilian federal government for free software. Through an agreement between the Free Software Foundation and the National Institute of Information Technology, he translated and adapted the Free Software Foundation's licenses to Portuguese and integrated them with Creative Commons licenses. This unprecedented development led to the creation of hybrid licenses CC-GNU-GPL and CC-GNU-LGPL, which formed the legal basis for free and public software initiatives in Brazil.


=== Copyright Law Reform ===
Lemos drafted the bill on collective copyright management that was incorporated into the final report of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry on ECAD (the Central Bureau for Collection and Distribution). The process resulted in the enactment of Law No. 12,853/2013, which amended Brazil's Copyright Law. Among the provisions of the new law are increased oversight of ECAD by trade associations and public bodies, and expanded accountability regarding rightsholders over their works.


=== Mudamos Platform ===
Through ITS Rio, Lemos created the digital platform Mudamos, which enabled citizens to digitally sign bills of popular initiative. The goal was to simplify the collection of signatures required for such bills to be submitted to legislative bodies. The platform served both as a repository for legislative proposals and as a tool for digital signature collection.
