== Platform ==
Corporify is a software-as-a-service platform that centralizes legal entity data, using digital share registers to model ownership structures and store related contracts and governance documents. It uses blockchain technology to link verified data to documents, enabling automatic updates to connected files when source information changes.
Corporify operates on a subscription model and supports automated document workflows, Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) and Know Your Customer (KYC) reporting.
