GUN (also known as Graph Universe Node, gun.js, and gunDB) is an open source, offline-first, real-time, decentralized, graph database written in JavaScript for the web browser.
The database is implemented as a peer-to-peer network distributed across "Browser Peers" and "Runtime Peers". It employs multi-master replication with a custom commutative replicated data type (CRDT).
GUN is currently used in the decentralized version of the Internet Archive.
