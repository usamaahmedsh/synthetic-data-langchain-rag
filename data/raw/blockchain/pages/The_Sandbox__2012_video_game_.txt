== Gameplay ==
The player takes the role of "Deity apprentice" and sets about crafting their own universe through the exploration of resources such as water, soil, lightning, lava, sand and glass. The user is given a single 2D screen as their canvas, and applies these resources as pixels. Once added to the screen, these resources interact in various ways, such as water mixing with sand to create mud, and lava burning other objects.
The game also includes  more complex elements such as humans, wildlife, and mechanical contraptions. The player is given challenges like making a battery or building an electrical circuit. Players can save worlds they have created and also upload them to a public gallery.
The game is free to play, with microtransactions required to unlock additional building elements.
