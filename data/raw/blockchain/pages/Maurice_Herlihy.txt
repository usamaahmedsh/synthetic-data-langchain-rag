Maurice Peter Herlihy (born 4 January 1954) is an American computer scientist active in the field of multiprocessor synchronization. Herlihy has contributed to areas including theoretical foundations of wait-free synchronization, linearizable data structures, applications of combinatorial topology to distributed computing, as well as hardware and software transactional memory. He is the An Wang Professor of Computer Science at Brown University, where he has been a member of the faculty since 1994.
Herlihy was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2013 for concurrent computing techniques for linearizability, non-blocking data structures, and transactional memory.
He is the son of historians David Herlihy and Patricia Herlihy. His brother, David V. Herlihy, is also a historian.
