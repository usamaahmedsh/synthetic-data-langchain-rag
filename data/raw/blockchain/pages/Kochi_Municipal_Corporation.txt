== History ==
The port at Kozhikode held superior economic and political position in medieval Kerala coast, while Kannur, Kollam, and Kochi, were commercially important secondary ports, where the traders from various parts of the world would gather. The arrival of the Portuguese at Kappad, Kozhikode in 1498, during the Age of Discovery, opened a direct sea route from Europe to India. However with the arrival of Portuguese, the power of Zamorin began to decline and Kochi began to emerge as the largest port city on the coast. 
The Fort Kochi had its first municipality established under Dutch influence on 18 April 1664 which was limited within Dutch occupied Kochi Stormburg Fort (Immanuel Fort), which was the oldest municipality in the Indian sub-continent. However, with the handing over of Kochi to the British as part of Anglo-Dutch treaty, the municipality of Fort Kochi was disbanded and much of the local administration were then carried out by Pandara officials (Revenue department of Cochin Kingdom). The Ernakulam town was under the direct protection of the British Resident of Kochi. A municipality under the chairmanship of British Resident was commissioned in 1823 to administer Ernakulam town. However it didn't have local representation, rather constituted by military officials of the British East India Company.
Fort Kochi, which was a part of Malabar District until 1956, was made a municipality on 1 November 1866, along with Kannur, Thalassery, Kozhikode, and Palakkad, according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in Towns act 1850) of the British Indian Empire. Its first Municipal Council seating contest was conducted in 1883. This was first modern municipality in the region and also the first native (not under British India) municipality of the country. Much of Kochi's progress in local administration came under reign of Maharaja Rama Varma along with support of Diwan Sankunni Menon. In the year 1873, Mattancherry areas were demarcated out of Fort Kochi and a new municipal board was formed. In 1896, the Maharaja announced establishment of a municipal board for Ernakulam town, constituted by 4 members from palace, 2 members from local communities, one Englishman and 2 members from other religious minorities. The mayor was nominated by Maharaja. These were the first steps towards establishing a modern municipalities in the city.
After independence, these 3 municipalities remained and was brought under Indian laws. In 1956 the erstwhile Elamkulam Panchayat and a portion of Cheranallur Panchayat (Pachalam - Vaduthala) were amalgamated to the Ernakulam Municipality. In 1962 a portion of Palluruthy Panchayat (Mundamveli area) was amalgamated to the then Mattancherry Municipality. Edappally Panchayat was formed in 1946 and Palluruthy and Vyttila in 1953. The idea behind the formation of Kochi Municipal Corporation was first shaped in the Mattancherry Municipal Council. The Council passed a resolution requesting the Government to form Cochin Municipal Corporation amalgamating the Municipalities of Ernakulam, Mattancherry and Fort Kochi, on 9 July 1960. However, the erstwhile Fort Kochi Municipal Council was strongly opposed to this proposal. 
Kerala State Assembly approved the proposal of Cochin Municipal Corporation. The Government of Kerala, as per their order G.O. (MS) 276/67/DD dt. 27/9/67, notified the formation of the Municipal Corporation of Kochi by amalgamating the three historical Municipalities of the state (Ernakulam, Mattancherry and Fort Kochi) with the Willingdon Island, four Panchayats (Palluruthy, Vennala, Vyttila and Edappally) and the small islands of Gundu Dweepu, Ramanthuruth. The new Corporation came into existence on 1 November 1967, having a total area of 83.524 km2. The name of the Corporations was later changed to Kochi Municipal Corporation, to reflect the local name.

== Issues ==
One of the main issues that the Kochi Municipal Corporation faces is that much of the modern city has developed outside the official city limits which was last defined in 1967. As a result, the extended urban agglomeration grew much more than any other city of India, leaving the corporation dry in resources. As Kochi is a major industry and thriving modern port-city, it required much more strong leadership and plans, which till now never materialized. The city grew in unplanned way without any masterplan creating more problems. As most of the town-planning agencies like transport, electricity, water distribution were managed by Kerala Government, the Kochi Corporation failed in co-ordinating various agencies implementing various projects. Apart from all these, much of the infrastructural development funds for the city were given to Greater Cochin Development Authority which often creates administrative clashes and issues over implementation.
One of the major issue which the city faced earlier was waste management which aggravated in 2002, which was partially solved by commissioning of the Brahmapuram Waste Management Plant in 2008. However this was gradually converted into a dumping yard. In 2023, a major fire broke out at the Brahmapuram plant resulting in major parts of Kochi city getting engulfed in smoke.
