Keolu Fox is an American scientist and human geneticist at the University of California, San Diego. He is an associate professor in the anthropology department at the University of California, San Diego and an Affiliate Investigator in the Human Genomics Division at the J Craig Venter Institute. Fox's research is focused on developing and applying new technologies in genomics. Fox is the first Native Hawaiian to receive a PhD in Genome Sciences and the first Native Hawaiian to be awarded tenure at the University of California, San Diego.
Fox has been an advocate for the community-based participatory research model as a strategy for increasing collaboration between the field of genetics and Indigenous communities. He has also examined the potential use of data trusts, federated machine intelligence, and blockchain technologies for Indigenous data sovereignty. 


== Early life ==
Fox’s mother’s family is from the island of Hawaiʻi, traditionally known as Moku o Keawe. They are originally from Kohala, and they later moved to the Hāmākua coast region of the Big Island. His heritage reflects a common mix found on the Big Island: Native Hawaiian and Portuguese, with his Portuguese roots tracing back to Madeira. He grew up in a rural environment shaped by ranching, land stewardship, and agricultural traditions, including the paniolo (Hawaiian cowboy) culture of the region.

As a graduate student, Fox focused on improving the accuracy of blood type matching for transfusions and organ transplants to prevent fatal reactions. His thesis, "Next Generation ABO Genetics and Genomics," explored genetic variations in the ABO gene, which determines A, B, or O blood types. Recognizing the limitations of current serological methods, Fox utilized next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze these variations in diverse populations. His goal was to develop better tools for identifying blood types from NGS data, aiding in the understanding of links between ABO blood types and diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Fox's research led to the discovery of new ABO blood types and the ability to predict the haplotype structures and blood types of ancient hominids, including Neanderthals and Denisovans, from ancient genome sequencing data for the first time.
Fox has also studied the introduction of leprosy in Oceania using Ancient DNA. He has also worked to empower Native American communities with technologies for mobile genome sequencing.
In their 2019 Nature article, Fox and John Hawks were among the first scholars to highlight the lack of rules and regulations in the field of ancient DNA (aDNA) research, describing it as colonial and extractive, and a violation of Indigenous rights. They called for accountability and transparency in tracking the use and movement of ancient remains, akin to the management of natural resources.
In a single author New England Journal of Medicine article titled "The Illusion of Inclusion — The 'All of Us' Research Program and Indigenous Peoples’ DNA," Fox critiqued the NIH's All of Us program for exploiting Indigenous genetic data without proper safeguards. He emphasized the need for greater Indigenous participation in data governance and equitable benefit-sharing to prevent the misuse of genetic information and uphold Indigenous rights.
In 2021, Fox and others demonstrated how genomic studies of Indigenous peoples, particularly Pacific Islanders, can reveal their migratory histories, enhance understanding of disease susceptibility due to colonial impacts, and support claims for land repatriation and Indigenous rights.
In 2024, Fox participated in groundbreaking research in French Polynesia, identifying new mutations in Pacific Islander populations and reconstructing their voyaging histories using genome sequence data. Fox and colleagues conducted the first comprehensive study on gout prevalence and population genetics in French Polynesia. This study revealed that nearly one in five adults in French Polynesia suffer from gout and hyperuricaemia and identified specific mutations in the HLA region that may contribute to gout susceptibility among Polynesians.


== Earth Friendly Computation ==
Fox and fellow genome scientist Dr. Eric Dawson have been instrumental in pioneering a new paradigm known as Earth Friendly Computation, an initiative aimed at integrating sustainable practices into the rapidly growing field of computational science, particularly in AI development and data center architecture. This concept merges Indigenous knowledge systems, sustainable technologies, and modern computational methods to mitigate the environmental impact of large-scale data processing.
Fox's vision for Earth Friendly Computation draws inspiration from circular economies and Indigenous data sovereignty principles. Central to this vision is the creation of decentralized, climate-resilient data centers powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, sea water, and hydroelectric power, particularly on sovereign Indigenous lands. This initiative empowers Indigenous communities to lead in technological innovation, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional data centers that are energy-intensive and environmentally damaging.
One of the flagship projects within the Earth Friendly Computation initiative is "Breathing Life Back into Zombie GPUs," which repurposes discarded, yet functional, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to reduce electronic waste. By utilizing these underutilized resources, the project aims to extend the life cycle of technological hardware and lower the carbon footprint associated with AI and machine learning development.
Another critical component is the development of a GIS-based app for sustainable planning, which overlays geographic data on Indigenous reservations to optimize the placement of data centers by factoring in renewable energy availability, biodiversity, and topography. This tool supports long-term, localized industrial symbiotic relationships and ensures that technological advancements align with the health and sustainability of the planet.
In their 2024 TED talk in Vancouver, BC, Fox and Dr. Cliff Kapono  explored using plant DNA as a storage medium, envisioning eco-friendly systems replacing data centers. Drawing on Indigenous knowledge and biotechnology, they proposed a sustainable approach to managing global data demands. The talk blended scientific innovation with ecological responsibility, offering a glimpse of nature-powered data infrastructure.


== Professional activities ==
Fox is a co-founder and board member of the Native BioData Consortium. Fox is an advocate of Indigenous futurism. In 2020, Fox, Theresa Ambo, and K. Wayne Yang foundered the UCSD Indigenous Futures Institute (IFI). The IFI is an Indigenous-led institute that aims to counter the legacy of unethical scientific practice and Indigenous peoples. IFI channels a community-based participatory model to create community-driven solutions to climate crisis, global pandemics, and the continued denial of Indigenous sovereignty.
In January 2025, Fox played a key advisory role in a landmark $50 million partnership between Variant Bio and Novo Nordisk to develop drugs for metabolic disorders using genetic data from Indigenous populations. Notably, 4% of Variant Bio’s revenue will go directly to Indigenous communities to support local health, environment, education, and/or culture-related initiatives. Fox hailed the deal as a breakthrough in ethical research and justice: “This is about restoring relationships. For thousands of years, Indigenous people have lived in harmony with some of the world’s most remote, beautiful places, shaping their genomes. Now, if they choose to, they can buy back that same land with the proceeds of this agreement.” He added that this effort promotes cultural renewal, ecological restoration, and climate resilience—"Robin Hood, but with pipettes, sequencers, and bioinformatics."
In "Hawai‘i, from ashes to sustainability," Fox discussed the devastating impact of the Lahaina fire on Maui and the environmental pressures caused by overdevelopment and industrial tourism in Hawaii. Fox, a Native Hawaiian, advocates for a sustainable and equitable approach to recovery, emphasizing the need for ecotourism, Indigenous environmental management, and a green economy. He highlights successful initiatives like the Hawai‘i Clean Energy Initiative and calls for greater inclusion of Indigenous voices in environmental governance. Fox argues for a fundamental shift in Hawaii's economic model, focusing on community-based tourism and conservation, to build a resilient and sustainable future for the islands.
In February 2025, Fox delivered the prestigious Darwin Lecture at the University of Cambridge, titled "Wayfinding Through the Human Genome," exploring the intersections of Indigenous navigation, genomics, and data science, drawing parallels between traditional Polynesian wayfinding and modern approaches to understanding human genetic diversity.
At UCSD, Fox is affiliated with the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute, the Institute for Genomic Medicine, the Department of Anthropology, the Global Health Program, the Climate Action Lab, the Design Lab, and the J Craig Venter Institute. Fox also serves as a faculty advisor to UCSD's Black Surf Week program, which combines athletic training in surfing with the study of Black people's relationships to water.
