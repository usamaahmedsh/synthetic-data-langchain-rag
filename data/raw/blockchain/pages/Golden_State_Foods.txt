It is a 100% management-owned and -operated company. In the early 1950s, it started providing meat products to McDonald's Corporation.
By 1972, the founder William Moore, who was a friend of Ray Kroc, decided to make McDonald's its exclusive and unique client. In 1980, James E. Williams and a group of investors acquired Golden State Foods for $29 million, even though the company was making $330 million in annual revenue.
With 12 manufacturing plants and distribution centers in the United States, Australia and Egypt, GSF generated $1.5 billion in sales in 1997, still with only one unique customer, McDonald's.

Williams, along with Butler Capital Corp, sold Golden State Foods to Wetterau Associates, a St. Louis-based investment group led by the CEO Mark Wetterau and The Yucaipa Companies with the latter as the majority stakeholder.

The machine was able to turn on due to the failure of Golden State Foods to practice lockout–tagout procedures mandated by safety regulations. Their practice was to clean with the machine running as it was slightly easier. California OSHA and the Los Angeles County District Attorney filed a criminal charge against the company over this matter. Golden State Foods pleaded no contest to the criminal charge.
