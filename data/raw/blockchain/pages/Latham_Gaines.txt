As 1/2 of the duo GAINES, Gaines and brother Shelby Gaines create sound sculpture from 'found' materials.  Their pieces have been featured in several NY Art Shows and their live performance of their original score in Ethan Hawke’s revival of Sam Shepard’s A Lie of the Mind earned them a Drama Desk Award nomination in 2010. They collaborated with Hawke again in 2013, creating the sound doors that provided the soundtrack for "Clive" - Jonathan Marc Sherman's latter-day variation on Brecht's "Baal".
Most recently, Latham and his brother built five new instruments from found objects and used them to create the original score for the 2019 film The Kid from Mimran Schur Pictures, directed by Vincent D'Onofrio.
