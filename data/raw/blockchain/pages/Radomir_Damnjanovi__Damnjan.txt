Radomir Damnjanović Damnjan (Serbian Cyrillic: Радомир Дамњановић Дамњан; 10 December 1935 – 10 July 2025) was a Serbian-Italian painter and conceptual artist. Over a career spanning six decades, he explored and expanded traditional art forms, often questioning prevailing notions of creativity and authorship. His artistic practice encompassed a wide range of media, including painting, photography, video, and installation.
Damnjan exhibited at Documenta in Kassel (1964), the São Paulo Art Biennial (1963), the Paris Biennale (1965), the Venice Biennale (1966, 1976), the Tokyo Biennale (1967), and the International Biennial of Young Artists Danuvius (1968). He lived and worked in Milan, Italy.


== Early life and education ==
Damnjan graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade in 1957 and completed his postgraduate studies in 1959. By the late 1950s, he had become actively involved in the Yugoslav art scene, holding solo exhibitions at the Gallery of the Graphic in 1958 and 1960, and participating in the Danas Group.
His early works featured minimalist landscapes incorporating symbolic and abstract elements. This approach later developed into explorations of primary geometry and conceptual art, setting him apart from the dominant artistic movements in Yugoslavia at the time.


== Art ==
Throughout his career, Damnjan underwent significant transformations in his artistic practice, reflecting his continual engagement with diverse artistic forms.


=== 1950s – Figurative painting ===
In the early stages of his career, Damnjan produced figurative works aligned with the postmodern artistic trends of the period, such as Kalemegdan (1955). These works reflect his interpretation of contemporary landscapes, incorporating elements of symbolism and metaphysical inquiry.


=== 1960s – Minimalism and abstract art ===
During the 1960s, Damnjan adopted a minimalist and abstract approach, simplifying forms to their fundamental elements. His series Sandy Shores (1961) and Elements in Space (1963–64) exemplify this period, emphasizing the interplay between form and spatial composition.


=== 1970s – Conceptual and appropriative art ===

During the 1970s, Damnjan fully embraced conceptual art. His work adopted a more activist and reflective character, seeking to provoke critical engagement rather than aesthetic approval. In 1974, he relocated from Belgrade to Milan, where he became actively involved in the Italian art scene.
That same year, he held his first solo exhibition in February at Carla Ortelli Studio, presenting In Honour of the Soviet Avant-Garde (1973), a series of eight black-and-white photographs marking his initial use of photography as an artistic medium. This exhibition, along with later shows—particularly those at the Multhipla Gallery—brought him international recognition, including coverage in Flash Art magazine and inclusion in Achille Bonito Oliva's influential book Europa-America. Le avanguardie diverse (1976).
During this period, Damnjan also created his "primary paintings", characterized by monochrome fields that emphasized colour, form, and the conceptual nature of the painting process itself.


==== Appropriation and misinformation ====
Damnjan's artistic development during the Cold War coincided with global and regional social changes and the rise of electronic media. This environment influenced his exploration of new media and the themes of appropriation and misinformation in art.
He increasingly focused on the conceptual and intellectual dimensions of art, questioning traditional notions of originality and authenticity. In his Forgery series (1975–1976), Damnjan reinterpreted well-known works by Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carrà, adding his own painted seals to mark them as reinterpretations. These works examined the concepts of creativity, authorship, and intellectual property.

Damnjan used a stamp reading "Work of Verified Artistic Value" to authenticate his pieces, satirically commenting on the art market's value system. This practice reflected the influence of Marcel Duchamp and extended the discussion surrounding originality and authorship in contemporary art. His Misinformation series (1972–1975) developed these ideas further, featuring monochromatic fields paired with incongruent inscriptions that encouraged reflection on how information is created and interpreted.

In this period, Damnjan increasingly worked with mass media such as photography, film, and video. Series like Nine Times Damnjan (1975) and Nothing Superfluous in the Human Spirit (1976) explored questions of perception and identity. His engagement with performance art blurred the boundaries between reality and representation, with video works and short films such as Man Made of Newspaper or the Possibility for Communication (1973), Flag (1974), Reading Marx, Hegel, and the Bible (1975), and The Daily Ritual of Drinking Coffee (1976) highlighting his interest in performativity and self-reflection.


=== 1980s – Re-examination of painting ===
For Damnjan, the 1980s marked a significant return to painting within a renewed conceptual framework. His works from this period incorporated stains, colour fields, and lines, emphasizing the act of painting as a process rather than a means of representation. This phase reflected a broader exploration of the medium, focusing on the emotional, material, and performative aspects of creation.

During this time, Damnjan also began integrating ready-made materials into his practice, merging still life composition with everyday items such as bottles and shelves, as seen in Still Life with Bottles (1982). This approach blurred the boundaries between art and daily life, echoing the experimental tendencies of Dada and Fluxus movements.


=== 1990s – Expansion of painting ===
During the 1990s, Damnjan expanded his artistic practice to include body painting, using faces—both his own and those of others—as canvases for his work. Pieces such as Portrait of Ješa Denegri (1999) illustrate this fusion of painting and body art. He also produced reliefs presented as wall-mounted works, introducing a three-dimensional dimension to his exploration of painting.


=== 2000s onwards – Problematic (Paradoxical) painting ===
From the 2000s onwards, Damnjan continued to expand the possibilities of painting by integrating new technologies and further examining the relationship between shape and colour. In his Painting series, he created canvases featuring coloured stains that transformed initial chaos into a sense of order, engaging viewers' visual perception and evoking the principles of entropy.


==== Recent work: Painting series (2020) ====
Among the artist's final works, the Painting series (2020) represents a synthesis of painting and sculpture. Damnjan conceptually appropriated the medium of sculpture to create paintings that exist in both physical and digital forms, each connected to the blockchain. Through this body of work, he continued to explore the dematerialisation of art in both physical and conceptual spaces, where the boundaries between painting and sculpture became increasingly fluid.
The physical works were constructed from industrial-grade metal and treated with synthetic pigments and fluorinated paints to ensure durability against environmental effects. Through the use of unconventional pastel and vivid colours, Damnjan extended his ongoing investigation into the expressive and structural potential of colour and form.

Works from the Painting series (2020) were exhibited at the 62nd Annale: New Fundamental Tendencies in Poreč, Croatia, in 2022, alongside other artists from the Marinko Sudac Collection and in collaboration with the Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde. This exhibition situated Damnjan's practice within the context of contemporary digital and conceptual art.
Most recently, works from the series were presented at the Ras Al Khaimah Fine Arts Festival (RAKFAF) in the United Arab Emirates in 2024.


== Global recognition ==
Damnjan achieved international recognition early in his career. He participated in several major art exhibitions, including Documenta in Kassel (1964), the São Paulo Art Biennial (1963), the Paris Biennale (1965), the Venice Biennale (1966, 1976), the Tokyo Biennale (1967), and the International Biennial of Young Artists Danuvius (1968).
His works are included in the collections of major international museums, including the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Museum moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien (MUMOK) in Vienna, among others.


== Death ==
Damnjan died in Milan, Italy, on 10 July 2025, at the age of 89.


== Legacy and impact ==
Damnjan worked across a wide range of media, including painting, drawing, graphics, photography, film, video, and performance. In the 1960s, early in his career, he produced works characterized by symbolic, abstract, and minimalist features. From the 1970s onwards, he increasingly engaged with new media, including video, photography, and performance, while his painting followed a more analytical approach.
By the late 1980s, Damnjan turned to still life and (self-)portrait works, often incorporating floor or wall installations. These pieces, executed in the spirit of postmodern citation, have been described as a form of "new pointillism".
