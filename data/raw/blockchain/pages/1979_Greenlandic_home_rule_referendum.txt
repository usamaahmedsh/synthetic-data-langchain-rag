A consultative referendum on home rule was held in Greenland on 17 January 1979. Just over 70% of voters voted in favour of greater autonomy from Denmark, leading to the establishment of a Greenlandic Parliament and Greenland gaining sovereignty in areas such as education, health, fisheries and the environment.
As a result of the referendum, home rule came into effect 1 May 1979 and Greenland became an autonomous constituent country of the Kingdom of Denmark.
