Peyman Faratin (born September 16, 1965) is an Iranian/American computer scientist, and the founder of Robust Links, an Internet company building algorithms for creating and processing a knowledge graph.


== Background ==
Faratin completed his PhD in computer science under the supervision of Prof. Nicholas R. Jennings and Prof. Carles Sierra. He made significant contributions in the area of artificial intelligence, particularly to automated negotiation in multi-agent systems. He was then a research scientist at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAIL) laboratory, working with David D. Clark in the Advanced Network Architecture group.
