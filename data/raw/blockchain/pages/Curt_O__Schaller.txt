Curt Oswald Schaller (born June 22, 1964) is a German cinematographer,  Steadicam operator and photographer.
He is also the developer and designer of ARRI's camera stabilization systems: in 2025 he was awarded an Academy Award for the concept, design and development of the Trinity 2 system.


== Career ==
In 1984, Schaller began training as a camera assistant and then as a cameraman at the Bavaria film and television studios in Munich, Germany.
Following his training, he worked as a cameraman and as a Steadicam operator in German TV series, films, shows, and documentaries.
At the end of the 1990s, Schaller used his experience as a cameraman and Steadicam operator and began to develop his own camera stabilization systems, from which the artemis series by Sachtler / Vitec Videocom emerged in 2001. The artemis series was the world's first modular camera stabilization system when it was launched at the 2001 NAB Show in Las Vegas. In addition, the artemis HD systems were the first full HD camera stabilization systems in the world at the time.
In 2015, Curt O. Schaller developed the (artemis) Trinity system together with the engineer Roman Foltyn. It is the world's first camera stabilization system to combine a mechanical stabilization system with an electronic one: and it is considered the most advanced camera stabilization system in the world, used in films such as 1917, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.
In April 2016, he moved with his entire artemis product portfolio from Sachtler / Vitec Videocom to ARRI to drive the further development of the (artemis) Trinity systems as product manager for camera stabilization systems.
In 2025, Curt O. Schaller was awarded the Academy Scientific and Engineering Award for the concept, design and development of the Trinity 2 system.
