== History ==
Members Too Short and E-40 have been releasing collaborative songs since the mid-1990s, with their debut collaborative albums History: Function Music and History: Mob Music being released in 2012. Creation of a supergroup was in discussion shortly thereafter, but never came to fruition until December 2020.
In a 2021 interview with DJ Vlad, Too Short stated that the group's debut album would be followed up with "volumes", similar in style to his release of The Pimp Tape (2018). In April 2021, the group performed a song titled "Big Subwoofer" at the Jake Paul vs. Ben Askren fight. The song was officially released on October 20, 2021, alongside its music video for Snoop Dogg's Def Jam debut compilation Snoop Dogg Presents Algorithm.
On October 11, Ice Cube announced the "Too Big" single release date which came out on October 21. Their debut album, titled Snoop Cube 40 $hort, officially released on December 9, 2022 on all digital platforms with a CD release to follow.
