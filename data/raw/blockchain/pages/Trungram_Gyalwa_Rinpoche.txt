Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche (also known as Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche) is a Tibetan Buddhist master and head of the Trungram lineage. A prominent figure in the Kagyu tradition, he is recognized as one of its most senior tulkus (reincarnate lamas). He has also received extensive transmissions from the Nyingma lineage and teaches in the spirit of the nonsectarian Rimé movement. Notably, he is the first incarnate lama to earn a PhD in the West, having completed a doctoral program in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies at Harvard University. Gyalwa Rinpoche has founded organizations across Asia and the United States that seek to modernize traditional Buddhist teachings while preserving their core principles.
Born into a Nepalese Sherpa family, he was identified as the fourth incarnation of Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche by Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa. This recognition solidified his position within the Kagyu hierarchy and established his role in continuing the Trungram lineage's spiritual legacy.


== Birth and recognition ==
Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche was born into a Sherpa family in Nepal. According to traditional accounts, his early life exhibited extraordinary signs, including a reported translucent abdomen as an infant. This characteristic prompted his parents to consult Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa and supreme head of the Kagyu lineage. During a public audience, the Karmapa is said to have spontaneously recognized the child as the tulku (intentional rebirth) of the third Trungram Gyalwa before his parents spoke. The Karmapa interpreted this physical marking as a symbol of the predecessor's mastery of Mahamudra, a core meditation practice in Tibetan Buddhism.
Formally proclaimed as the Fourth Trungram Gyalwa, the Karmapa bestowed upon him the name Trungram Gyalwa Tulku Karma Tenpai Gyaltsen Trinlay Kunkhyab Pal Sangpo and presented him with dharma robes. He also administered Buddhist refuge vows and composed a long-life prayer for the child. The enthronement ceremony was later held at Rumtek Monastery, in Sikkim, India, the historic seat of the Karmapas.


=== Names and titles ===
The naming conventions of the Trungram lineage derive from its founding figure. The first incarnation was known as Gyalwa Trulku ("Victorious Incarnation"), with "Trulku" (Tibetan: sprul sku) denoting a recognized reincarnate lama. Over time, the title evolved into Trungram Gyalwa Trulku Rinpoche, combining the lineage name (Trungram), honorifics (Gyalwa, "Victorious One"), and the honorific Rinpoche ("Precious One"). The fourth incarnation frequently uses the abbreviated form Gyaltrul (short for Gyalwa Trulku), rendering his primary title Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche.
He is also referred to by alternative names and titles, including Drungram Gyaltrul, Tenpai Gyaltsen, Gyalwa Lama, and Gyalwa Trulku. While his official style is His Eminence Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche or His Eminence Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche, he prefers the simplified Trungram Gyalwa in personal writings. In Western academic contexts, he occasionally uses Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche, PhD, reflecting his status as the first tulku to earn a doctoral degree (from Harvard University). Globally, students and devotees typically address him honorifically as Rinpoche.


== Education ==


=== Early years in Rumtek ===
Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche began his formal education at Rumtek Monastery at the age of three. Under the guidance of Kagyu lineage masters, he received a traditional monastic education, which included foundational training in rituals, liturgy, and Buddhist ethics. Later, he advanced to the Jamyang Khang school at Rumtek, where he studied Tibetan Buddhist literature, philosophy, and classical texts.  
At Rumtek, he took the vows of a getsul (Tibetan: dge tshul; novice monk), though he did not pursue full ordination (gelong, dge slong) in subsequent years. Prior to enrolling in secular higher education, he chose to return his novice vows, a decision reflecting his intent to engage with broader academic and societal contexts while maintaining his spiritual commitments.


=== Education at Nalanda Institute ===
Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche enrolled at the Karma Shri Nalanda Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies in Rumtek, where he pursued comprehensive studies in traditional Buddhist disciplines. His curriculum spanned Buddhist philosophy, logic, epistemology, soteriology, cosmology, codes, debates, history, classical poetry, Sanskrit, literature, traditional medicine, and meditation practices. Alongside his academic pursuits, he co-founded the Students' Welfare Union of Nalanda, an organization dedicated to supporting peer education and community welfare, and served as one of the institute's three primary teaching assistants.
During his tenure at Nalanda, he earned the title of Ka-rabjampa (Tibetan: ཀ་རབ་འབྱམས་པ་, "one with unobstructed knowledge of scriptures"), a distinction recognizing his mastery of Buddhist texts. He further attained the degree of Acharya (Master of Buddhist Philosophy) with first-class honours from Sampurnanant Sanskrit University in Varanasi, India, solidifying his expertise in both Tibetan and classical Indian Buddhist traditions.


=== Ecumenical training and teachers ===
Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche’s education reflects the non-sectarian (Rimé) ethos of his predecessors. He studied under masters from all four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism—Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, Geluk—including some of the most revered figures of the 20th century. His primary mentors were the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, from whom he received the majority of his transmissions, empowerments (wang), and oral instructions (tri). The 16th Karmapa also appointed Khenchen Trinley Paljor Rinpoche as his principal tutor, overseeing his foundational training.

Additional influential teachers included Sakya Trizin (head of the Sakya school), Trulshik Rinpoche, and the late Ugyen Tulku Rinpoche, Khamtrul Rinpoche, Trulshik Rinpoche, Kalu Rinpoche, Salje Rinpoche, and Gendun Rinpoche. He further undertook advanced philosophical studies under Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche and Khenpo Choedrak Rinpoche, renowned scholars of the Kagyu tradition.


=== Further studies ===
Besides traditional Buddhist education, Trungram Gyalwa studied liberal arts at Kirkwood College in Iowa, United States, and later at Newbury College in Massachusetts, United States. He worked with Professor Donald Lopez as a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan, and was involved in a teaching exchange program and sutra translation there.
Later, he studied Chinese for six months in Taiwan at the Language Learning Center of the National Taiwan Normal University. He is fluent in Tibetan, English, Nepali, Sherpa, Chinese, and has a good knowledge of Sanskrit, Hindi, and French.


=== Doctoral studies at Harvard University ===
In 1996, Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche enrolled in the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies (now South Asian Studies) at Harvard University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. His doctoral concentration centered on Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies, with a focus on comparative analysis of textual traditions, meditative practices, and institutional developments across Buddhist cultures.
He was awarded a PhD in 2004 for his dissertation, which examined the life and works of Gampopa (1079–1153), the 12th-century scholar-yogi and foremost disciple of Milarepa. The study highlighted Gampopa's pivotal role in systematizing Kagyu doctrine and practice, particularly his synthesis of monastic discipline (vinaya), Mahamudra teachings, and Kadampa contemplative traditions. This research contributed to broader academic discussions on Kagyu historiography and the evolution of Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism.


== Worldwide activities ==


=== Traditional teachings ===
Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche began delivering public teachings during his youth. At the age of 12, he addressed European visitors at Rumtek Monastery, expounding on the essence of Mahamudra—a central meditation tradition in Kagyu Buddhism—as systematized by the Indian master Naropa, alongside teachings on Avalokiteśvara (the bodhisattva of compassion). The following year, he instructed Rumtek's monastic community on The Thirty-Seven Practices of Bodhisattvas, a seminal text by the 14th-century scholar Gyalse Tokme Zangpo. His exposition earned recognition from senior khenpos (scholar-teachers) and rinpoches present. Shortly thereafter, he conducted his first initiation ceremony, conferring the Kagyu lineage's longevity practices (Tsewang), which are rooted in the blessings of Amitāyus, the Buddha of Infinite Life.
In subsequent decades, Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche expanded his role as a teacher and lineage holder. He has transmitted empowerments (wang), oral instructions (tri), and philosophical guidance across Asia, Europe, and North America. Additionally, he has established Buddhist centers and study groups dedicated to preserving traditional practices while adapting them to contemporary contexts.


=== Academic teachings ===
In 2016, Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche resumed his academic career as the Numata Visiting Professor in Buddhist Studies at McGill University, a position affiliated with the university's prestigious Numata Chair. During his tenure, he taught a graduate seminar titled Issues in Buddhist Studies, which explored interdisciplinary approaches to interpreting Buddhist texts, practices, and historical developments.


=== Preservation of practice lineages ===
During a visit to Trungram Monastery in Tibet and its adjacent sacred cave—a meditation site of the Third Trungram Gyalwa—Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche reunited with thousands of disciples of his predecessor. Recognizing the endangered status of the monastery's Nyengyu tradition (Tibetan: སྙན་རྒྱུད, snyan rgyud; "oral transmission"), a rare lineage then sustained by only a handful of masters, he initiated measures to revitalize its teachings. These efforts included organizing transmission ceremonies, documenting oral instructions, and training new lineage holders.
Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche served as president of Dharmodaya (National Buddhist Association of Nepal), advocating for the preservation of Nepal's Buddhist heritage. In this role, he represented Nepal at the 1998 International Buddhist Conference in Sydney, Australia, addressing global challenges in sustaining Buddhist traditions. He remains a lifetime advisor to the organization.


=== Wellbeing initiatives ===
In 2004, under Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche’s patronage, monks of the Trungram lineage established Dharmakaya, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving and disseminating Tibetan Buddhist wisdom traditions. The institution focuses on translating classical teachings into contemporary contexts, offering meditation programs, and fostering interfaith dialogue.
In 2017, an affiliated facility, the Dharmakaya Center for Wellbeing, opened in Cragsmoor, New York. The center provides structured retreats (both short-term and extended), Dharma study courses, and wellness programs integrating Buddhist contemplative practices with modern mindfulness techniques. Its curriculum emphasizes the application of Mahamudra and compassion practices (e.g., tonglen) in daily life.


=== Philanthropic activities ===
In the early stages of his public work, Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche founded the United Trungram Buddhist Foundation (UTBF), initially established in Nepal and later expanded internationally. The foundation and its affiliated United Trungram Buddhist Fellowship (UTBF) articulate three core objectives:  

Preserving Tibetan Buddhist wisdom traditions through textual preservation and teachings.
Facilitating educational initiatives, including monastic and secular programs.
Providing humanitarian aid, with a focus on supporting disadvantaged children in Nepal and other developing regions.
Following the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche coordinated immediate relief efforts in Barpak Village Development Committee (VDC), Gorkha District—the earthquake's epicenter. His teams distributed food, medical supplies, and temporary shelters to affected communities. Building on this response, he established Buddhist Relief Services, a nonprofit organization dedicated to long-term disaster recovery, infrastructure rebuilding, and psychosocial support for survivors.


=== Promoting peace and unity ===

Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche spearheaded the establishment of the World Center for Peace and Unity (WCPU) at Lumbini, Nepal, the birthplace of Gautama Buddha. Inaugurated in 2011, the center occupies a designated development zone adjacent to the Lumbini UNESCO World Heritage Site. Conceived as a non-sectarian hub, it welcomes visitors of all Buddhist traditions and non-Buddhists alike, particularly those underrepresented among the national monasteries built in Lumbini. 
Designed by Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche himself, the WCPU's architecture draws inspiration from the ancient Nalanda Mahavihara stupa and incorporates elements of 7th–13th century Nepalese Buddhist architecture, a golden age of sacred design in the region. The structure is the largest within the Lumbini United Nations Development Project Site but prioritizes sustainability through:  

Cavity walls for thermal insulation.
Natural ventilation systems.
Solar energy integration.
Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche has emphasized that this eco-conscious design reflects Buddhist principles of interdependence, tangibly promoting global unity and environmental stewardship.
The center aims to foster interdenominational cooperation, revive traditional Buddhist arts, and model 21st-century Buddhism's role in addressing ecological challenges. Its programs emphasize dialogue, meditation retreats, and cultural preservation initiatives.


=== Educational initiatives ===
Founded in 1995, Trungram International Academy (TIA) is a private, English-medium secondary school located near Kathmandu, Nepal, offering both day and boarding programs. The institution emphasizes holistic education, blending academic rigor with ethical development rooted in Buddhist values.
In 2003, Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche initiated plans for the Trungram Gyalwa Foundation, which was formally established in 2015. The foundation's mission is to advance global education and well-being through four primary avenues:  

Educational expansion: Supporting TIA's growth, including the construction of schools for communities affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquake.
Compassion-based curriculum: Developing pedagogical frameworks that integrate empathy, care, and tolerance into formal education.
Preservation of traditions: Documenting and disseminating endangered Buddhist teachings through digital archives and teacher-training programs.
Scientific research: Collaborating with academic institutions to study the psychosocial and physiological benefits of compassion practices.


=== Writing and lecturing ===
Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche is an active public speaker, delivering teachings and participating in academic and interfaith conferences across the United States. In 2013, he was a featured speaker at the Mindfulness on the Mountain event hosted by Google in Mountain View, California, addressing the integration of Buddhist contemplative practices in modern life.
Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche has contributed essays and articles to prominent publications, including HuffPost and has written for Tricycle: The Buddhist Review. His writings explore themes such as the adaptation of traditional Buddhist teachings in contemporary society, the interplay between mindfulness and technology, and the role of compassion in global ethics.


== Trungram Gyalwa lineage ==

The Trungram Gyalwa (Tibetan: དྲུང་རམ་རྒྱལ་བ་) is a trülku (reincarnate lama) lineage of the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. The lineage traces its origins to Eastern Tibet and is renowned for its integration of meditation mastery, scholarship, and non-sectarian (Rimé) teachings.


=== First Trungram Gyalwa ===
The first Trungram Gyalwa, born in Lhathog, Eastern Tibet, was a yogi celebrated for his meditative attainments. Initially recognized as Gyalwa Trülku ("Victorious Incarnation"), he later adopted the name Trungram Gyalwa after revitalizing Trungram Monastery, situated near the Sichuan-Tibet border. His younger brother and disciple, Trinley Rabgye, became the first Aten Rinpoche, establishing a parallel lineage.


=== Second Trungram Gyalwa ===
The second incarnation, Gowa Gyalwa, distinguished himself as both a scholar and practitioner. Historical accounts note his manifestation of an Ushnisha (crown protuberance), a physical sign associated with advanced spiritual realization in Buddhist iconography.


=== Third Trungram Gyalwa ===
The third Trungram Gyalwa, Gotsa Gyalwa Luntok Thrinlay (1894–1959), was born in Derge, Eastern Tibet, and recognized by the 15th Karmapa, Khakyab Dorje (1871–1922). A principal disciple of the Karmapa, he became one of the 20th century's most revered meditation masters, renowned for his mastery of the Tripiṭaka (Buddhist scriptures) and bodhisattva practices.


==== Teachings and legacy ====
His non-sectarian approach attracted tens of thousands of students across traditions, including Kagyu, Nyingma, Sakya, Gelug, and Bon. Prominent disciples included Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Chagmey Rinpoche, and members of the 16th Karmapa's family. He emphasized adapting teachings to individual needs, a hallmark of the Rimé movement.


==== Ascetic life and retreats ====
In his youth, he transitioned from an energetic child to a contemplative ascetic, meditating in mountain caves from age 18. He established retreat centers near Trungram Monastery and integrated Rechungpa's Whispered Lineage (Nyengyu, Tibetan: སྙན་རྒྱུད་) into the Trungram tradition. His primary residence was Ngonmo Namzong ("Azure Sky Castle"), a cave complex surrounded by meadows where he practiced intensively, subsisting largely on wild nettles. 
Khandro Lhamo, wife of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, recounted her visit: 

One of Khyenste Rinpoche's main teachers was Drungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche, who lived his entire life in a cave near Ngoma Nagsum. I had never met him before, but one time I accompanied Rinpoche to Drungram Monastery, and we stayed near his cave. His cave was in the middle of a large rock outcropping shaped like a vajra and surrounded by meadows. Five or six hundred of his disciples lived in the surrounding caves and practiced the Guru Rinpoche sadhana. So many people circumambulated the rock that the earth was worn away down to waist level. When I met him, his hair hadn't turned gray yet, so he must have been in his fifties. He would eat only once a week and almost never slept.
