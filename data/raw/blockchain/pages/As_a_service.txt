"X as a service" (rendered as *aaS in acronyms) is a phrasal template for any business model in which a product use is offered as a subscription-based service rather than as an artifact owned and maintained by the customer. The converse of conducting or operating something "as a service" is doing the same using "on-premise" assets (such as on-premises software) or lump sum investments. Originating from the software as a service concept that appeared in the 2010s with the advent of cloud computing, the template has expanded to numerous offerings in the field of information technology and beyond it. The term XaaS can mean "anything as a service".
The following is an alphabetical list of business models named in this way, including certain forms of cybercrime (criminal business models).
