Reddy's research have been focused on total organic synthesis of molecules with a view to their applications in agricultural and medicinal uses. He is credited with the total synthesis of over 20 agro-chemicals which includes a mealy bug-attracting sex pheromone that has reported use in crop protection. He has also developed several other products that has potential uses as cell-adhesion inhibitors, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory as well as anti-cancer agents and as insect repellents.
He employs the Silicon-switch approach for developing drug strategies for diseases affecting the central nervous system and his work has assisted in the drug discovery for the treatment of some infectious diseases as well as diabetes. His researches have been documented by way of a number of peer-reviewed articles; Google Scholar, an online article repository of scientific articles, has listed 123 of them respectively. He has also applied for 30 patents based on his researches.


== Awards and honours ==
Reddy received the Award for Excellence in Drug Research of the Central Drug Research Institute in 2013 and the Scientist of the Year Award of the National Chemical Laboratory the same year. He received three awards in 2015, starting with the NASI-Reliance Industries Platinum Jubilee Award, followed by the Bronze Medal of the Chemical Research Society of India. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, also in 2015.
