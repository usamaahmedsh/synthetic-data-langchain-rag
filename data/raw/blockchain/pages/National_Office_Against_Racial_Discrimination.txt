The National Office Against Racial Discrimination (Italian: Ufficio Nazionale Antidiscriminazioni Razziali), also known by the acronym UNAR, is an Italian state body with the function of promoting equal treatment and the removal of discrimination based on race or ethnic origin.

The organisation operates in an autonomous and impartial manner and also deals with the different impact that discrimination can have on women and men, as well as the existence of forms of racism of a cultural and religious nature. It was established by the second Berlusconi government with the legislative decree 9 July 2003, No. 215, transposing community directive No. 2000/43 EC.

== Controversies ==
In 2017, an investigation by the program Le Iene reported that in a private club affiliated to the National Association Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination (ANDDOS), which had access to state funding amounting to €55,000 thanks to a UNAR tender, not yet disbursed, there was homosexual group sex and prostitution. Subsequently, ANDDOS specified that the money paid by UNAR (awarded through a regular tender) was not linked to the support of the group but the aim was to finance specific projects relating to courses on discrimination. On 20 February 2017, following the media outcry caused by the investigation, the UNAR director Francesco Spano resigned from office. In July 2018, all the accusations relating to Spano, the former director of UNAR, were dropped and the Court of Auditors confirmed the correctness of the announcement that ended up under accusation.
