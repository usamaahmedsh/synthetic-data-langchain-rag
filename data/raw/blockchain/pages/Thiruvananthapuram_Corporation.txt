== History ==
The Conservancy Department was started in Thiruvananthapuram in 1877 during the reign of the king Ayilyam Thirunal of the Travancore kingdom. Under this arrangement, the town was divided into 5 divisions, namely Kottaykkakam (areas inside the Fort), Chalai, Sreevaraham, Manacaud and Pettah.
The first president of the Committee was Dewan Peshkar Iraviperur Pillai. There were 19 members in the committee. The Thiruvananthapuram Municipality came into existence in 1920. After two decades, during the reign of Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, Thiruvananthapuram Municipality was converted into Municipal Corporation on 30 October 1940.


== Administration ==
The city corporation is governed by a council of 100 members, headed by the Mayor. The members of the Council are elected every five years, with the latest election having been in 2020. It constitutes Standing Committees for exercising its powers, discharging such duties or performing such functions as are provided for in the Kerala Municipalities Act.
The Mayor is elected by the councilors from among themselves. They chair Council meetings and are responsible for the overall supervision and control of the administrative functions of the Municipal Corporation.
The Deputy Mayor is the Chairman of the Finance Standing Committee and also presides over the Council meetings during the absence of the Mayor. The Secretary of the TMC is a civil servant appointed by the Kerala Government. The law and order of the city is handled by the Thiruvananthapuram City Police Commissioner. The total police strength in the city including the Armed Reserve camp at Nandavanam and the SAP camp at Peroorkada, is about 4,500.
The corporation was originally (in 1940) divided into 24 wards, covering an area of 30.66 km2. Through the years, the city corporation has grown to 100 wards, and now the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation Council is the second largest democratically elected body in Kerala after the Legislative Assembly.
