Digital Initial Private Offering (DIPO) is a trademarked capital-raising model developed by LiveTrade LTD, a Delaware-based financial technology company established in 2019. The model is designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) raise capital through the tokenization of their securities using blockchain technology.


== Background ==
DIPO was developed to address challenges faced by small and medium-sized businesses in accessing traditional capital markets. According to LiveTrade, the model aims to provide an alternative to traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) for companies that find conventional fundraising methods too expensive or complex.
The concept was designed to bridge traditional and digital financial markets using blockchain technology.


== Intellectual property ==
DIPO is a registered trademark of LiveTrade LTD. According to company statements, the model is also subject to a pending patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.


== Process ==
According to LiveTrade's documentation, the DIPO process involves several stages:


=== Project evaluation ===
LiveTrade evaluates projects based on growth potential and regulatory compliance requirements before acceptance into the DIPO platform.


=== Tokenization ===
Approved companies' securities are converted into digital tokens, with the company claiming a 1:1 ratio to real-world asset value.


=== Trading ===
The tokenized securities are made available for trading through LiveTrade's platform infrastructure.


== Regulatory considerations ==
LiveTrade states that DIPO is designed to operate within existing U.S. securities regulations, including provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D exemptions for private placements. The company claims compliance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements, though independent verification of regulatory approvals has not been publicly documented.
The broader regulatory framework for digital asset securities continues to evolve, with the SEC's Crypto Task Force working to establish clearer guidelines for the industry.


== Technology ==
The platform utilizes blockchain technology for token creation and transaction processing. LiveTrade has announced partnerships with various technology platforms to support the tokenization process.


== Market deployment ==
LiveTrade initially deployed the DIPO model in Vietnam, with stated plans for broader regional expansion. The company has indicated that multiple projects have utilized the platform, though specific performance metrics have not been independently verified.
Vietnamese media outlets have covered LiveTrade's blockchain initiatives and the DIPO model as part of the country's emerging financial technology sector.


== Risks and challenges ==
Like other security token offering models, DIPO faces several challenges:

Regulatory uncertainty in the evolving digital securities landscape
Technology risks associated with blockchain infrastructure
Market liquidity concerns for tokenized securities
Compliance complexity across multiple jurisdictions
Financial journalist Polina Rebeka wrote in 2024 that the tokenized securities sector requires careful navigation of existing securities laws and ongoing regulatory developments.
