Assisted dying, assisted death, aid in dying, medical aid in dying, medical assistance in dying (MAiD) or help to die is the involvement of healthcare professionals in the provision of lethal drugs intended to end a patient’s life, subject to eligibility criteria and safeguards.
Assisted dying is a broad concept, which encompasses:

Assisted suicide, the practice of helping or assisting another person to end their own life.
Euthanasia, the practice of otherwise intentionally ending someone's life to relieve pain and suffering.
Palliative sedation, which may in some cases accelerate the death of the patient, so sometimes it is also considered an assisted death.
