The first championship took place in Höfen an der Enz, Germany, in 1990.

On September 1, 2007, competitors of the world's most hirsute faces from the UK, America, Germany and other countries convened for the championships in Brighton. It was hosted by the Handlebar Club with comedy performer Michael "Atters" Attree acting as chairman and master of ceremonies.
