East Asia Forum (EAF) is an English-language international policy forum directed by Peter Drysdale and based at the Australian National University's Crawford School of Public Policy. It was launched in 2006 by then Australian Treasurer Peter Costello.
It is a platform for dialogue on Asian economic and public policy, publishing two articles a day online. EAF also releases a quarterly magazine, the East Asia Forum Quarterly (EAFQ), published by ANU Press.
EAF offers peer-reviewed daily analysis of economics, politics and public policy in the Asia Pacific. Articles focus on policy issues including trade, economic and social policy, governance, international relations and political developments. Content includes Australian, East Asian and Asia Pacific regional perspectives, with specialist contributors from around the region. An editorial is issued every Monday.
East Asia Forum is an initiative by the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research (EABER). Its articles are archived and catalogued by the National Library of Australia.


== Controversy ==
East Asia Forum’s website was blocked on 16 September 2023 in Singapore following a non-compliance of a correction order under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act. Ying-Kit Chan from the National University of Singapore contributed an article titled "A spate of scandals strikes Singapore", in which the Prime Minister's Office stated that the article had four falsehoods relating to corruption investigations into various government ministers and extramarital affairs among four Members of Parliament. The block was rescinded on 22 September 2023 after the article was retracted and removed upon the author's request.
