Helen V. Milner (born 1958) is an American political scientist. She is currently the B. C. Forbes Professor of Public Affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, where she also directs the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance. She has written extensively on issues related to international political economy, including international trade, the connections between domestic politics and foreign policy, globalization and regionalism, and the relationship between democracy and trade policy.


== Education ==
Milner graduated with a BA (honors) in international relations from Stanford University in 1980 and earned her Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University in 1986.


== Academic career ==
Since 1986 she was a professor at Columbia University and was between 2001 and 2004 the James T. Shotwell Professor of International Relations at Columbia University. She joined Princeton University in 2005, where she served as chair of its Politics department until 2011.
In 2012-2014, she served as president of the International Political Science Association.
In 2021-2022, she served as president of the International Studies Association.
Currently, she is conducting research on issues related to globalization and development, such as the political economy of foreign aid, the digital divide and the global diffusion of the internet, and the relationship between globalization and environmental policy.


== Research ==
In her 1988 book Resisting Protectionism, Milner seeks to explain why U.S. trade policy in the 1920s was more protectionist than in the 1970s, despite many similar underlying conditions. She argues that greater economic interdependence in the latter period created a coalition of actors who stood to gain from trade and thus lobbied against protectionism. The social science research design book Designing Social Inquiry by King, Keohane and Verba characterizes her study as a successful way that qualitative scholars can overcome omitted variable bias.
