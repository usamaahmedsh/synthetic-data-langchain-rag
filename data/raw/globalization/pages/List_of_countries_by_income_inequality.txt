This is a list of countries and territories by income inequality metrics, as calculated by the World Bank, UNU-WIDER, OCDE, and World Inequality Database, based on different indicators, like the Gini coefficient and specific income ratios. Income from black market economic activity is not included.
The Gini coefficient is a number between 0 and 100, where 0 represents perfect equality (everyone has the same income). Meanwhile, an index of 100 implies perfect inequality (one person has all the income, and everyone else has no income).
Income ratios include the pre-tax national income share held by the top 10% of the population and the ratio of the upper bound value of the ninth decile (i.e., the 10% of people with the highest income) to that of the upper bound value of the first decile (the ratio of the average income of the richest 10% to the poorest 10%).
Income distribution can vary greatly from wealth distribution in a country.
