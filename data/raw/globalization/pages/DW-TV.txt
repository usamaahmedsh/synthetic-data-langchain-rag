DW-TV (German pronunciation: [ˈdeːveːteːˈfaʊ̯]) is a German multilingual TV news network of Deutsche Welle. Focussing on news and informational programming, it first started broadcasting 1 April 1992. DW broadcasts on satellite and is uplinked from Berlin. DW's English broadcast service is aimed at an international audience.


== History ==
The predecessor of DW-TV was RIAS-TV, a television station launched by RIAS, a West Berlin broadcaster in August 1988. The fall of the Berlin Wall the following year and German reunification in 1990 led to the closure of RIAS-TV. 
On 1 April 1992, Deutsche Welle inherited RIAS-TV's broadcast facilities, using them to start a German and English-language television channel broadcast via satellite, DW (TV), adding a short Spanish broadcast segment the following year. In 1995, it began 24-hour operation (12 hours in German, 10 hours in English, two hours in Spanish). At that time, DW (TV) introduced a new news studio and a new logo.
In 2001, Deutsche Welle (in conjunction with ARD and ZDF) founded a subscription TV channel for North American viewers called German TV. The project was shut down after four years due to low subscriber numbers. It was replaced by the DW-TV channel, which is also a subscription service.
Unlike most other international broadcasters, DW-TV doesn't charge terrestrial stations for use of its programming, and as a result its DW News and other programmes are rebroadcast on numerous public broadcasting stations in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. In the Philippines, some English-language programmes are broadcast nationwide on Net 25 and PTV 4. In the U.S., some of its programs were distributed via the World Channel as well as MHz Worldview, although after the closure of MHz Worldview in 2020, a few stations have since offered a full carriage of DW-TV.
In March 2009, DW-TV expanded its television services in Asia with two new channels: DW-TV Asia and DW-TV Asia+. DW-TV Asia (DW-TV Asien in German) broadcasts 16 hours of German programming and eight hours in English while DW-TV Asia+ broadcasts 18 hours of English programmes plus six hours of German programmes.
In August 2009, DW-TV ceased broadcasts on Sky channel 794 in the United Kingdom.  The channel continues to be available via other satellites receivable in the UK.
Deutsche Welle relaunched their television channels and their schedules on 6 February 2012, using the abbreviation DW for all its services.
Deutsche Welle changed its schedules again on 22 June 2015, with DW in Asia and Oceania and DW (Europe) merged to become a 24-hour English news channel. English programmes on DW (Arabia) and DW (Español) were discontinued.

=== Satellite jamming ===
A transponder on Hot Bird 8, used by DW-TV among other stations, was jammed on 7 and 8 December 2009. Eutelsat, the operator of the satellite localised the emitter source in Iran. The same happened between 10 and 13 February 2010.
