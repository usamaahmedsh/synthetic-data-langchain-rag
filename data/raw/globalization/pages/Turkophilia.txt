Turkophilia (Turkish: Türkofili) is the feeling or expression of interest in, respect for, and appreciation of Turks on the part of a non-Turk. More specifically, a Turkophile is someone who has a strongly positive predisposition or sympathy towards Turkey and the Turkish people, with an admiration for their language and literature, culture (art, music, cuisine, etc.), history, or government. The phenomenon may also include a broader appreciation of the Turkic peoples, of whom the Turkish people are a part. The opposite sentiment is known as Turkophobia.


== Early modern period ==

In Western discourse, the term "Turcophile" is often linked to the cultural phenomenon of Turquerie, reflecting the broader European admiration for the customs, aesthetics, and splendor of the Ottoman Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries. Although these concepts have distinct historical foundations, they both reflect the influence and presence of Turkish culture, traditions, and artistic heritage within the European context.
