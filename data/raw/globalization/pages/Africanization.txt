Africanization or Africanisation (lit., making something African) has been applied in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and in the composition of the civil service via processes such as indigenization.


== Africanization of names ==
Africanization has referred to the modification of place names and personal names to reflect an "African" identity. In some cases, changes are not only of transliteration but of the European name.
In many cases during the colonial period, African placenames were Anglicized or Francized.
