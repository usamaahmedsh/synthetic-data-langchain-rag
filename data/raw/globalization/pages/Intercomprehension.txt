Intercomprehension is when people try to communicate with each other using their own different languages. Intercomprehension can be explained as a dialogue between people from two different languages. Each one expresses in their own language, making efforts to understand each other.
Here we find some European methods to learn Intercomprehension. These four methods were the pioneer in this branch of linguistics and started around 2000 in different universities: Galatea, EuRom4, EuroComRom (Les sept tamis), and Understanding romance languages. All these methods focused in reading skills learning simultaneously in different Latin languages as these languages are so close in semantics, phonetics, etymology etc.
