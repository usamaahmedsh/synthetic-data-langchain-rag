Børsen (full name: Dagbladet Børsen) is a Danish newspaper specialising in business news published in Denmark.


== History and profile ==
Børsen was founded in 1896 by merchant and editor Theodor Hans Carsten Green. In 1899, it was changed into a newspaper with a particular focus on business and stock exchange content. From then and until 1909, Børsen was also formally associated with Grosserer-Societetet (English: The Merchant Society).
In 1969, the majority shareholder became the Swedish Bonnier Group. The publishing house changed its name to Forlaget Børsen Ltd. In 1970, the paper was reorganized to almost exclusively feature business news, resulting in an improved net circulation. The success of the Swedish business magazine Veckans Affärer was functional in this change.
In January 2016, negotiations were underway for Bonnier Group to sell Børsen to JP/Politikens Hus at the price of 800 million kroner. The Danish Competition and Consumer Authority (Konkurrence- og Forbrugerstyrelsen) indicated that it was opposed to a merger because the combined company would be too dominant in the Danish market. On Tuesday, 24 January 2017, JP/Politikens Hus A/S said it had withdrawn its offer to merge with Dagbladet Børsen and instead had opted for a 49.9% ownership of Dagbladet Børsen for a price of 400 million Danish kroner. Bonnier Group would have a 50.1% ownership of the company.
Børsen is published on weekdays, not on weekends, and is based in Copenhagen.
Børsen has no political affiliation, but it supports the free market economy and private business as well as worldwide trade. The paper publishes a list, Børsen Guld.

Its circulation was 41,000 copies in 1995, again 42,000 copies in 1996 and 41,000 copies in 1997. It slightly rose to 43,000 copies in 1998 and to 45,000 copies in 1999.

== Design ==
Since 1 March 1993, the newspaper has stood out by its use of salmon-pink paper, an intentional reference to the British Financial Times. As of 2011, the newspaper was redesigned, incorporating salmon-pink further by also using the color across all platforms. Magenta was also chosen as a signal color, PT Serif as the primary typeface, and the logo was replaced by a new, hand-drawn one made by the Danish designer Jan Andersen.
