In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number, or basic reproductive number (sometimes called basic reproduction ratio or basic reproductive rate), denoted 
  
    
      
        
          R

    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
  
 (pronounced R nought or R zero), of an infection is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. The definition assumes that no other individuals are infected or immunized (naturally or through vaccination). Some definitions, such as that of the Australian Department of Health, add the absence of "any deliberate intervention in disease transmission". The basic reproduction number is not necessarily the same as the effective reproduction number

 is not a biological constant for a pathogen as it is also affected by other factors such as environmental conditions and the behaviour of the infected population.

    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
  
 values are usually estimated from mathematical models, and the estimated values are dependent on the model used and values of other parameters. Thus values given in the literature only make sense in the given context and it is not recommended to compare values based on different models.

 are determining if an emerging infectious disease can spread in a population and determining what proportion of the population should be immunized through vaccination to eradicate a disease. In commonly used infection models, when 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0

 the infection will be able to start spreading in a population, but not if 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0

. Generally, the larger the value of 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
  
, the harder it is to control the epidemic. For simple models, the proportion of the population that needs to be effectively immunized (meaning not susceptible to infection) to prevent sustained spread of the infection has to be larger than 
  
    
      
        1
        −
        1
        
          /

    {\displaystyle 1-1/R_{0}}
  
. This is the so-called herd immunity threshold or herd immunity level. Here, herd immunity means that the disease cannot spread in the population because each infected person, on average, can only transmit the infection to less than one other contact. Conversely, the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to infection in the endemic equilibrium is 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        
          R

    {\displaystyle 1/R_{0}}
  
. However, this threshold is based on simple models that assume a fully mixed population with no structured relations between the individuals. For example, if there is some correlation between people's immunization (e.g., vaccination) status, then the formula 
  
    
      
        1
        −
        1
        
          /

    {\displaystyle 1-1/R_{0}}
  
 may underestimate the herd immunity threshold.

The basic reproduction number is affected by several factors, including the duration of infectivity of affected people, the contagiousness of the microorganism, and the number of susceptible people in the population that the infected people contact.


== History ==
The roots of the basic reproduction concept can be traced through the work of Ronald Ross, Alfred Lotka and others, but its first modern application in epidemiology was by George Macdonald in 1952, who constructed population models of the spread of malaria.  In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by 
  
    
      
        
          Z
          
            0

.

 estimation methods


=== Compartmental models ===

Compartmental models are a general modeling technique often applied to the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. In these models, population members are assigned to 'compartments' with labels – for example, S, I, or R, (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered). These models can be used to estimate 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
  
.


=== Epidemic models on networks ===

Epidemics can be modeled as diseases spreading over networks of contact and disease transmission between people. Nodes in these networks represent individuals and links (edges) between nodes represent the contact or disease transmission between them. If such a network is a locally tree-like network, then the basic reproduction can be written in terms of the average excess degree of the transmission network such that:

  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0
          
        
        =
        
          
            β
            
              β
              +
              γ
            
          
        
        
          
            
              
                ⟨
                
                  k
                  
                    2
                  
                
                ⟩
              
              −
              
                ⟨
                k
                ⟩
              
            
            
              ⟨
              k
              ⟩
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}={\frac {\beta }{\beta +\gamma }}{\frac {{\langle k^{2}\rangle }-{\langle k\rangle }}{\langle k\rangle }},}
  

where 

  
    
      
        
          β
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\beta }}
  

is the per-edge transmission rate, 

  
    
      
        
          γ
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\gamma }}
  

is the recovery rate, 

  
    
      
        
          ⟨
          k
          ⟩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\langle k\rangle }}
  
 is the mean-degree (average degree) of the network and 
  
    
      
        
          ⟨
          
            k
            
              2
            
          
          ⟩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\langle k^{2}\rangle }}
  
 is the second moment of the transmission network degree distribution.


=== Heterogeneous populations ===
In populations that are not homogeneous, the definition of 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
  
 is more subtle. The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
  
 must account for this difference. An appropriate definition for 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
  
 in this case is "the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, produced by a typical infected individual".
The basic reproduction number can be computed as a ratio of known rates over time: if a  contagious individual contacts 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
  
 other people per unit time, if all of those people are assumed to contract the disease, and if the disease has a mean infectious period of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              1
              γ
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\dfrac {1}{\gamma }}}
  
, then the basic reproduction number is just 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              β
              γ
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}={\dfrac {\beta }{\gamma }}}
  
.  Some diseases have multiple possible latency periods, in which case the reproduction number for the disease overall is the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease.


== Effective reproduction number ==

In reality, varying proportions of the population are immune to any given disease at any given time. To account for this, the effective reproduction number 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            e
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{e}}
  
 or 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  
 is used. 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{t}}
  
 is the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual at time t in the partially susceptible population. It can be found by multiplying 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{0}}
  
 by the fraction S of the population that is susceptible. When the fraction of the population that is immune increases (i. e. the susceptible population S decreases) so much that 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            e
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{e}}
  
 drops below 1, herd immunity has been achieved and the number of cases occurring in the population will gradually decrease to zero.

 can be calculated from many different mathematical models. Each of these can give a different estimate of

 include the survival function, rearranging the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix, the next-generation method, calculations from the intrinsic growth rate, existence of the endemic equilibrium, the number of susceptibles at the endemic equilibrium, the average age of infection and the final size equation. Few of these methods agree with one another, even when starting with the same system of differential equations. Even fewer actually calculate the average number of secondary infections.
