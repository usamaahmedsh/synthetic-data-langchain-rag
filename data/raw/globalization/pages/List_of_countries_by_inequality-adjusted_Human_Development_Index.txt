This is a list of countries by inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI), as published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in its 2025 Human Development Report. According to the 2016 Report, "The IHDI can be interpreted as the level of human development when inequality is accounted for", whereas the Human Development Index itself, from which the IHDI is derived, is "an index of potential human development (or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality)".


== Methodology ==

The index captures the HDI of the average (calculated using not arithmetic, but geometric mean) person in society, which is less than the aggregate HDI when there is inequality in the distribution of health, education and income. Under perfect equality, the HDI and IHDI are equal; the greater the difference between the two, the greater the inequality.
The IHDI, estimated for the world and specific countries, captures the losses in human development due to inequality in health, education and income. Losses in all three dimensions vary across countries, ranging from just a few percent (e.g. Czech Republic and Slovenia) up to over 40% (e.g. Angola and Comoros). Overall loss takes into account all three dimensions.
Comparison between these two maps show low efficacy in showing a difference between IHDI and HDI.
