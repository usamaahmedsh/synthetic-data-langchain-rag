Andy Ng Siu-hong (Cantonese: 吳兆康, Cantonese Yale: Ǹgh Shiuh Hōng, born 1979) is a Hong Kong-born English politician. Ng is now a local councillor in Wokingham, England and was a councillor in the Central and Western District Council in Hong Kong.


== Early life ==
Ng attended Raimondi College, on the Mid-Levels in the City of Victoria on Hong Kong Island – which served as the polling station of the constituency he later represented. He was a graphic designer.


== Political career ==


=== Hong Kong ===
Ng, a member of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, was first elected to the Mid-Levels East constituency in the 2015 local elections after winning 50.9% of votes and defeating Jackie Cheung, a pro-Beijing candidate. He is considered a close ally of Ted Hui, a councillor of the same party for a neighbouring constituency in the district, who was nicknamed the "Central Duo" (中區孖寶) with him. In June 2018 he was attacked by a resident while promoting the annual 1 July march, apparently over his opposition against local liquor licences.
His majority in the constituency was further increased in the 2019 elections, to 57.28% (2,672 votes) with a gain of 6.38%, amidst the large wave of anti-government protests. He resigned on 29 April 2021, effective from May, after the government intended to introduce an oath-taking requirement for local councillors. Ng later revealed that he resigned because he was concerned due to his involvement in the democracy movement.


=== United Kingdom ===
Ng's family migrated to Reading, England in 2021. He joined various local groups to assist overseas Hongkongers, and became a member of the Liberal Democrats in 2023. He was selected to run for the seat of Maiden Erlegh and Whitegates in the Wokingham Borough Council in the 2024 local elections. Ng was elected with 1,162 votes to the three-member ward. Ng is the second from Hong Kong to sit on an English local authority after Ying Perrett who secured a seat at the Bisley & West End ward of Surrey Heath Borough Council in the November 2023 elections, and the first who had held an elected office in Hong Kong. Ng believed voters "have chosen a Hongkonger to represent them in the council because we share similar values", and the victory "has proven that Hongkongers can still win by participating in politics in Britain".
