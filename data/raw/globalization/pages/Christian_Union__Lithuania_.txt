Christian Union (Lithuanian: Krikščionių sąjunga) is a minor political party in Lithuania. It held its constituent congress on 8 February 2020.
The constituent congress elected the initiator of the party, Rimantas Dagys, its chairman. Member of Seimas Egidijus Vareikis, Signatory of the Act of March 11 Jonas Šimėnas, and several former members of the Seimas (including Petras Luomanas, Jonas Valatka, and Arvydas Akstinavičius) also became members of the party. Priest Robertas Grigas presided over a prayer in the congress. He said that he was asked to do so by cardinal Sigitas Tamkevičius.
Initially the party was meant to be named "Christian Union 'Harmony and Welfare'" (Lithuanian: Krikščionių sąjunga „Santarvė ir gerovė“), but the constituent congress has decided to shorten the name to "Christian Union" (Lithuanian: Krikščionių sąjunga).
The program adopted by the constituent congress claims that the party's "political activity is grounded in principles of Christian democracy and Christian social policy".
On 3 February 2024, it merged with the Lithuanian Family Movement.
