The Global Invasive Species Information Network (GISIN) is a web-based network of data providers including government, non-government, non-profit, educational, and other organizations that agree to work together to provide increased access to data and information on invasive species around the world.
Computer-based information systems like those in the GISIN present specific information to help detect, rapidly respond to, and control invasive alien species, flora or fauna.
