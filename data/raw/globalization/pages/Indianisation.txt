Indianisation (also spelt as Indianization) may refer to the spread of Indian languages, culture, diaspora, cuisines, economic reach and impact beyond the Indian subcontinent.


== History ==


=== Ancient era ===

Indianisation took place in Southeast Asia mainly from the first millennium onwards through trade and religion.


=== Colonial era ===
The term Indianisation was used in British India to describe the inclusion of native people in running India. For example, the Indian Armed Force began to Indianise in 1917. In the early 20th century, discourse around Indianisation also revolved around the emerging scholarship on an ancient Greater India and the possibility to re-assert India's value and independence. Initially, the theory considered it likely that Indians had colonised Southeast Asia in developing it, though later it became clear that influence occurred mainly through trade and peaceful contact.
