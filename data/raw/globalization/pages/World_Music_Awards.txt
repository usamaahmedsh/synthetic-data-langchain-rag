The World Music Awards was an international award show founded in 1989 under the patronage of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and co-founder/executive producer John Martinotti. Most years, the event was held in Monte Carlo. Awards were presented to the world's best-selling artists in several categories and to the best-selling artists from each major territory. Past winners have included Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Shakira, Gloria Gaynor, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, and Beyoncé.
The original trophy was a plaque depicting a mermaid, in a presentation case. Between 1990 and 1994, it was a golden treble clef with a globe in the middle. From 1995 on, it was a gold-plated Atlassian figure holding up the Earth above his head.
The event was last held in 2014, though its website remains live. The Global Recording Artist of the Year award, established in 2014 by IFPI, nowadays covers parts of what were the main categories of the World Music Awards.
