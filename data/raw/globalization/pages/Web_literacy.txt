Web literacy refers to the skills and competencies needed for reading, writing, and participating on the web. It has been described as "both content and activity" meaning that web users should not just learn about the web but also about how to make their own website.


== History of the concept ==
In the late 1990s, literacy researchers began to explore the differences between printed text and network-enabled devices with screens. This research was largely focused on two areas: the credibility of information that can be found on the World Wide Web and the difference that hypertext makes to reading and writing. These skills were included in definitions of information literacy and included in a SCONUL position paper in 1999. This paper became the '7 Pillars of Information Literacy', which was last updated in 2011.


== Web Literacy Map ==

The Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote openness, innovation, and participation on the Internet. It has created a Web Literacy Map in consultation with a community of stakeholders from formal and informal education, as well as industry. Work on what was originally entitled a Web Literacy 'Standard' began in early 2013. Version 1.0 was launched at the Mozilla Festival later that year. Going forward, 'standard' was seen to be problematic and against the ethos of what the Mozilla community was trying to achieve.
Literacy Version 1.1 of the Web Literacy Map Archived 2017-02-07 at the Wayback Machine was released in early 2014 and underpins the Mozilla Foundation's Webmaker resources section, where learners and mentors can find activities that help teach related areas. Although the Web Literacy Map is a list of strands, skills, and competencies, it is most commonly represented as a competency grid.
The Mozilla community finalized version 1.5 of the Web Literacy Map at the end of March 2015. This involves small changes to the competencies layer and a comprehensive review of the skills they contain.
