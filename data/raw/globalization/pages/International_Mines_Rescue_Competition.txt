The International Mines Rescue Competition (IMRC) is a biennial event which facilitates the testing of underground emergency response capability across global mining and Mine Rescue jurisdictions.  The competition is held  by the governing mine rescue body of the host nation or jurisdiction.
The purpose of the IMRC is to present realistic simulations that will allow organizers to:

1. Evaluate skills required to perform rescue operations in a mining environment.
2. Judge participants in an open and transparent manner.
3. Provide feedback to all participants.
4. Promote Mine Rescue through improved communication, co-operation and knowledge transfer between responders, mine operators, suppliers, regulators and educators.
