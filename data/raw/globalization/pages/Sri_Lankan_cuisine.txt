Sri Lankan cuisine is known for its particular combinations of herbs, spices, fish, vegetables, rices, and fruits. The cuisine is highly centered around many varieties of rice, as well as coconut which is a ubiquitous plant throughout the country. Seafood also plays a significant role in the cuisine, be it fresh fish or preserved fish. As a country that was a hub in the historic oceanic silk road, contact with foreign traders brought new food items and cultural influences in addition to the local traditions of the country's ethnic groups, all of which have helped shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Influences from Indian (particularly South Indian), Indonesian and Dutch cuisines are most evident with Sri Lankan cuisine sharing close ties to other neighbouring South and Southeast Asian cuisines.
Sri Lanka is historically famous for its cinnamon. The 'true cinnamon' tree, or Cinnamomum verum, used to be botanically named Cinnamomum zeylanicum to reflect its Sri Lankan origins. This is a widely utilized spice in Sri Lanka, and has a more delicate, sweet taste in comparison to Cinnamomum cassia, which is more common in some other Southeast Asian cuisines. Contrasting the local cuisine with those of neighbouring regions, Sri Lankan cuisine is characterized by unique spice blends with heavy use of Sri Lankan cinnamon and black pepper, as well as by the use of ingredients such as Maldives fish, goraka (Garcinia cambogia), pandan leaf, lemongrass, and jaggery made from kithul palm syrup. Sri Lanka is also a consumer of many varieties of red rice, some of which are considered heirloom rices in the country. Tea is also an important beverage throughout the country, and Sri Lanka is known for producing some of the world's finest tea.

== Dishes ==


=== Rice and curry ===

The central feature of Sri Lankan cuisine is boiled or steamed rice, served with a curry of fish or meat, along with other curries made with vegetables, lentils, or fruits.
Dishes are accompanied by pickled fruits or vegetables, chutneys, and sambols. Coconut sambol is especially common, a paste of ground coconut mixed with chili peppers, dried Maldives fish, and lime juice.


=== Kiribath ===

Kiribath or paal soru (lit. 'milk rice')  is rice cooked in salted coconut milk until the grains turn soft and porridge-like. Generally eaten for breakfast, kiribath is also prepared on special occasions such as birthdays, New Years' and religious festivals. It is usually served with lunu miris, a relish made with red onions and chillies. There is also a method of cooking kiribath with mung beans.

Hoppers (appam in Tamil, appa in Sinhala) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices.  The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can either be spicy (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Spicy hoppers are often accompanied by lunu miris, a mix of red onions and spices.


=== String hoppers ===

String hoppers (idiyappam in Tamil) are made from a hot-water dough of rice meal or wheat flour. The dough is pressed out in circlets from a string mold onto small wicker mats, and then steamed. This dish is typically not eaten plain and is often paired with a curry, such as kiri hodi.


=== Lamprais ===

A Dutch Burgher-influenced dish, lamprais is rice boiled in stock accompanied by frikkadels (frikadeller meatballs), a mixed-meat curry, blachan, aubergine curry, and seeni sambol.  All of this is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked in an oven. Lamprais is ideal for special occasions with large gatherings considering its richness and the time it takes to prepare. Lamprais is cooked twice; first the rice and the entrees are cooked separately and later what is already cooked is wrapped in a banana leaf and baked in an oven.

== Short eats ==
"Short eats" (colloquially called "shorties") are a ubiquitous category of savory and sweet snacks in Sri Lanka, encompassing items such as patties, cutlets, rolls, samosas, pies, and buns. Though now deeply ingrained in Sri Lankan culture, their origins are a fusion of colonial culinary influences adapted and "Sri Lankanised" over the past 80 years. The diverse array of short eats reflects the island's history of foreign presence. European influences (British, Dutch, Portuguese) contributed pies, pastries, fish patties, and the likely ancestor of the breadcrumb-coated cutlet (from the Portuguese bolinho). Meanwhile Indians introduced samosas and vadais, while Chinese settler communities introduced the "Chinese roll," a spicy, deep-fried spring roll distinct from those found in China.
The overarching concept of a mid-morning or afternoon snack to accompany tea was inspired by the English tradition of afternoon tea. The proliferation of short eats began in earnest during World War II (early 1940s), when bakeries expanded their offerings to cater to the significant European population. This initial adaptation for foreign palates gradually evolved into the distinctively Sri Lankan short eats known today.
By the 1960s, bakeries like Perera & Sons were widely selling these items. Their popularity expanded significantly in the 1970s, becoming a daily staple in Colombo and subsequently spreading across the island. The commercialization of Sri Lankan society in the 1980s further cemented their role as convenient and efficient food options for busy lifestyles. While derived from foreign concepts, short eats have been thoroughly transformed into a unique and enduring aspect of Sri Lankan culinary identity. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening.
Common short eats include:

Vade - savoury deep-fried fritters made from various ingredients. Varieties include parippu vade (lentils), ulundu vade (black gram and rice), isso (shrimp) vade, crab vade
Chinese rolls or egg rolls, which often contain minced meats, potatoes, and vegetables
Fish patty
Patties and pastries  - filled with vegetables, meat, or fish
Vegetable/fish roti - a flatbread with a filling rolled into a triangular shape and baked
Fish buns/Malu pan -  a brioche bun filled with a spicy potato and mackerel filling. Best for a savory breakfast or as a snack or to serve with tea.
Hot butter cuttlefish - fried cuttlefish in a spiced butter sauce
Short eats are served at parties or to guests when they visit a home. Western food such as hot dogs and hamburgers have arrived in Sri Lanka, with the globalization of fast-food chains such as McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut. However, foods from these establishments are not usually considered short eats. Additionally, hot dogs and hamburgers are also modified to fit local tastes.


== Beverages ==
Beverages commonly served in Sri Lanka include:

Faluda – a mixture of syrup, ice cream, jelly pieces and basil seeds, served cold
Fruit juice – including lime and passionfruit juice
King coconut water
Tea
Toddy – a mildly alcoholic drink made from palm tree sap
Arrack – an alcoholic spirit made from the fermented sap of the coconut flower.
