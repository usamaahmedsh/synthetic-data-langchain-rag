A periodization of capitalism seeks to distinguish stages of development that help understanding of features of capitalism through time. The best-known periodizations that have been proposed distinguish these stages as:

Early / monopoly / state monopoly capitalism (Sweezy)
Free trade / monopoly / finance capitalism (Hilferding)
Early capitalism (primitive accumulation) / colonialism / imperialism (Hobson, Lenin, Bukharin)
Extensive stage / intensive stage / late capitalism (Aglietta)
The Marxist periodization of capitalism into the stages: agricultural capitalism, merchant capitalism, industrial capitalism and state capitalism.
Another periodization includes merchant capitalism, industrial and finance capitalism, and global capitalism.
