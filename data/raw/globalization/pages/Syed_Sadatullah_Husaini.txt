== Views ==


=== Globalization and capitalism ===
Syed Sadatullah Husaini says that although Islam stands for globalization and universal brotherhood, modern globalization is a tool of exploitation that creates economic and social inequality. Globalization has resulted in the monopoly of Western cultural and ethical values and has undermined the political sovereignty of the national states.


=== Feminism and women ===
Syed Husaini is critical of both traditional Muslim societies and modern Western societies for their treatment of women. According to him, traditional Muslim societies have not given women their due place and rights as stipulated by Islam, while the modern West has snatched femininity and the very essence of womanhood from women in lieu of equality.


=== Muslim politics in India ===
Sadat argues that the right path for Muslims in a pluralistic society such as India is to engage in healthy dialogue with majority non-Muslim communities and contribute in a positive manner to nation-building. He has been critical of conspiracy theories and ghettoized politics. He has always urged fellow Muslims to develop positive mental attitudes and strengthen the communication channels with the majority community in India.


=== Postmodernism ===
In an exclusive paper, Syed has argued that postmodernism is a logically incorrect notion and it is an extreme reaction to modernism. According to him, the position of Islam that divinely revealed truths are absolute and all other truths are relative is a perfectly balanced notion that is free from the contradictions of postmodernism. He has supported the transmodernism notion of Ziauddin Sardar, and argued that Islam is a transmodern reality.


=== Right to Education Act ===
The Indian parliament has passed the Right to Education Act (RTE). It holds the government responsible for providing education to every citizen of the country. Criticizing the RTE act, Mr. Syed said that it has negated minorities' constitutional rights and that Muslims will not be able to run their religious educational institutions and madrasas.


== Books and articles ==

He has published the following books so far:

More than five of his books have been translated into Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. His interview has been published in the following book: "Muslim Leadership in India" - Global Media Publications, New Delhi.
