Tyler Cowen (; born January 21, 1962) is an American economist, author, and public intellectual. He is the Holbert L. Harris Professor of Economics at George Mason University and serves as chairman of the university’s Mercatus Center. Cowen is widely known for his blog Marginal Revolution, which he has co-authored with Alex Tabarrok since 2003, and for hosting the interview podcast Conversations with Tyler.
Cowen’s work spans economics, philosophy, and cultural commentary. He is known for advocating a pragmatic form of libertarianism that emphasizes strong governance, economic dynamism, and technological progress—an approach he terms state capacity libertarianism. In 2011, he was included in Foreign Policy’s list of the “Top 100 Global Thinkers,” and Prospect magazine ranked him among the world’s most influential economists in 2023.


== Education and early life ==
Cowen was raised in Hillsdale, New Jersey, and attended Pascack Valley High School. At 15, he became the youngest ever New Jersey state chess champion. Cowen is of Irish ancestry.
He graduated from George Mason University with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 1983 and received his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1987 with his thesis titled Essays in the Theory of Welfare Economics. At Harvard, he was mentored by game theorist Thomas Schelling, the 2005 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.


== Academic career ==
Cowen joined the faculty of George Mason University shortly after completing his doctorate and has remained there throughout his career. He holds the Holbert L. Harris Chair of Economics and serves as chairman of the Mercatus Center, a research institution that promotes market-oriented analysis of policy issues.
His early research focused on the economics of culture, public goods, and welfare economics. Cowen’s 1998 book In Praise of Commercial Culture argued that markets foster artistic creativity by broadening audiences and increasing opportunities for innovation. Later works explored globalization, philanthropy, and the economics of inequality.
Cowen has also written extensively on the economics of cultural consumption and economic growth. His 2011 book The Great Stagnation contended that the U.S. economy’s slower growth stems from a depletion of “low-hanging fruit” such as cheap land, mass education, and technological breakthroughs. The book was widely discussed across media and academia for reframing debates about innovation and productivity.
Cowen’s later scholarship continued this theme in works such as Average Is Over (2013), which predicted that artificial intelligence and automation would widen income inequality, and Stubborn Attachments (2018), a philosophical defense of long-term economic growth as a moral imperative.
In 2021, Cowen co-founded the talent-scouting platform Emergent Ventures, funded by the Mercatus Center, to identify and support promising young thinkers and innovators through fast, flexible grants.


== Ideas and public philosophy ==
Cowen’s intellectual work bridges economics, philosophy, and cultural studies. He is often associated with the Austrian School and public choice theory, yet he departs from orthodox libertarianism through his emphasis on social coordination, state capacity, and cultural flourishing.


=== State capacity libertarianism ===
In a 2020 essay, Cowen introduced the term “state capacity libertarianism” to describe a worldview that combines free markets with an effective and competent government. He argues that libertarians should favor a capable state that can provide essential infrastructure, invest in science, and maintain rule of law—all while preserving individual freedom and market dynamism. The concept gained attention across political commentary as a possible synthesis between libertarian and pragmatic governance traditions.


=== Views on innovation and growth ===
Cowen consistently stresses innovation and productivity as moral and economic imperatives. In Stubborn Attachments, he argues that sustained economic growth generates most of humanity’s welfare improvements and should guide long-term policymaking. He often criticizes cultural pessimism and risk aversion, contending that societies thrive when they reward entrepreneurship and intellectual curiosity.


=== Cultural economics and globalization ===
Cowen has written extensively on the interaction between markets and culture. In Creative Destruction (2002), he argued that globalization enhances cultural diversity by enabling cross-border exchange of art, food, and ideas rather than homogenizing them. His writings challenge both cultural protectionism and economic nationalism, asserting that cosmopolitan exchange strengthens cultural vitality.


== Media and public commentary ==
Cowen is an influential public economist whose writings, interviews, and online commentary bridge academic economics and mainstream discourse.


=== Marginal Revolution ===

In 2003, Cowen and fellow economist Alex Tabarrok launched the blog Marginal Revolution, which became one of the most widely read economics blogs in the world. The site covers economics, culture, politics, and global development, and has been cited by academics and policymakers alike. The Wall Street Journal called it “required reading for anyone serious about economic ideas.”
In addition to daily commentary, Cowen and Tabarrok use the platform to announce academic research, book reviews, and cultural reflections. Their posts have been collected in several anthologies and cited in economic literature for their early discussion of “markets in everything” — the blog’s long-running theme examining unexpected market mechanisms.


=== Conversations with Tyler ===
Since 2015, Cowen has hosted Conversations with Tyler, a podcast produced by the Mercatus Center that features long-form interviews with leading thinkers in economics, philosophy, science, and culture. His guests have included Amartya Sen, Esther Duflo, Margaret Atwood, and Peter Thiel. The show’s conversational style and Cowen’s deep preparation have been praised for eliciting substantive discussion. The Atlantic described it as "a masterclass in curiosity."


=== Columns and publications ===
Cowen writes a regular column for Bloomberg Opinion, where he comments on global economics, technology, and culture. His essays also appear in The New York Times, The Economist, The Free Press, and other major outlets.


== Reception and influence ==
Cowen is often cited as one of the most prominent public intellectuals translating economic thinking for a broad audience. The Economist called him “an evangelist for rational optimism,” while The New Yorker described his intellectual style as “an unrelenting curiosity about everything, informed by a moral seriousness about growth and human flourishing.”
Economists and writers across ideological lines have engaged with his ideas. Paul Krugman and Noah Smith have both debated Cowen’s views on growth and inequality.
Cowen has been recognized multiple times among the world’s top thinkers. In addition to being listed in Foreign Policy’s “Top 100 Global Thinkers” (2011) and Prospect magazine’s “Top 50 World Thinkers” (2013, 2023), he was named one of the “Most Influential Economists” by The Economist in 2024.
Scholars and journalists have described Cowen’s influence as extending beyond academia. The Financial Times called him “a bridge between the ivory tower and the real world of policy and technology.”  In 2012, David Brooks called Cowen "one of the most influential bloggers on the right", writing that he is among those who "start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a doctrinaire way".


== Personal life ==
Cowen is a teetotaler, saying he is "with the Mormons" on alcohol, and "I encourage people to just completely, voluntarily abstain from alcohol and make it a social norm".
