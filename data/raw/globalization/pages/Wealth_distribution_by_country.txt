World distribution of wealth is the distribution of how wealth is distributed around the world. The guideline for categorizing the data is to organize it based on the continent on which the people with wealth reside. Sometimes, the data is organized by household wealth.  It is useful to do it this way because sometimes the holders of wealth take care of other people who have no wealth, such as children or other family members.
