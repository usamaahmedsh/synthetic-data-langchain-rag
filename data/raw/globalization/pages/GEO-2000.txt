GEO-2000 is the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Global Environment Outlook 2000.
The UNEP launched the Global Environment Outlook in 1995 to assess environmental issues and to have them published. The first report was published in 1997, while the second report, known as GEO-2000, was published in 1999.

nitrogen's harmful impact on ecosystems
increased severity of natural disasters
species invasion as a result of globalization
increased environmental pressures caused by urbanization
decline in the quality of governance in some countries
new wars which impact on both the immediate environment and neighbouring states
