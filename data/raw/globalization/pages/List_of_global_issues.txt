A global issue is a matter of public concern worldwide. This list of global issues presents problems or phenomena affecting people around the world, including but not limited to widespread social issues, economic issues, and environmental issues. Organizations that maintain or have published an official list of global issues include the United Nations, and the World Economic Forum.

Biodiversity loss
Climate change
Destructive artificial intelligence
Environmental disaster
Nuclear holocaust
Pandemic
Biotechnology risk
Molecular nanotechnology
Societal collapse


== United Nations list ==

As part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UN Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015) were superseded by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (2016-2030), which are also known as The Global Goals. There are associated Targets and Indicators for each Global Goal.


== World Economic Forum List ==

Food security
Inclusive growth
Future of work/unemployment
Climate change
2008 financial crisis
Future of the internet/Fourth Industrial Revolution
Gender equality
Global trade and investment and regulatory frameworks
Long-term investment/Investment strategy
Future healthcare


== Global environmental issues ==

No single issue can be analysed, treated, or isolated from the others. For example, habitat loss and climate change adversely affect biodiversity. Deforestation and pollution are direct consequences of overpopulation and both, in turn, affect biodiversity. While overpopulation locally leads to rural flight, this is more than counterbalanced by accelerating urbanization and urban sprawl. Theories like the world-system theory and the Gaia hypothesis focus on the inter-dependency aspect of environmental and economic issues. Among the most evident environmental problems are:

Overconsumption – situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem.
Overpopulation – too many people for the planet to sustain.
Biodiversity loss
Food waste
Deforestation
Desertification
Global warming/climate change
Habitat destruction
Soil degradation
Holocene extinction
Ocean acidification
Ozone depletion
Pollution
Waste and waste disposal
Water pollution
Air pollution
Resource depletion
Urban sprawl
