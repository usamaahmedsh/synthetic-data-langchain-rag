NEAR is a public blockchain platform that uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and provides smart-contract functionality. Its native cryptocurrency is NEAR. It was founded in 2018 by Illia Polosukhin and Alexander Skidanov, with mainnet launching in 2020. 
Designed to maintain decentralized applications and high-throughput transactions through a sharded architecture, NEAR gained traction as an alternative to Ethereum and other layer-one blockchain networks.


== History ==
In 2020, NEAR closed a $21.6 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Around the same period, the project launched its mainnet, introducing a proof-of-stake architecture based on the “Nightshade” design and network sharding intended to improve throughput and costs for decentralized applications.
In 2022, a $350 million funding round led by Tiger Global was completed for the NEAR.
In January 2024 a critical peer-to-peer networking flaw that security firm Zellic dubbed a “Web3 Ping of Death”, which could have allowed a malicious peer to crash nodes and potentially halt the network. The issue stemmed from how nodes handled SECP256K1 signatures during the handshake process; Zellic privately disclosed the bug in December 2023 via the HackenProof platform, after which NEAR issued a fix and awarded a $150,000 bounty.


== Criticism and controversies ==
In November 2022, Skyward Finance, an IDO/launchpad built on NEAR blockchain, was exploited for roughly $3 million after an attacker abused a flaw in the project’s treasury redemption contract. The bug, identified by security firm BlockSec, failed to check for duplicate token account IDs, enabling the attacker to redeem wrapped NEAR in a loop within a single transaction. Skyward acknowledged that its treasury had been drained and advised users to cease interacting with the contracts, noting that the incident rendered the SKYWARD token effectively worthless.
In June 2023, Messari's analysts have questioned validator decentralization on Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, and others blockchain platforms. Messari study found that roughly 35% of NEAR’s staked tokens were hosted on Amazon Web Services, yielding a hosting “operational Nakamoto coefficient” of 1 (i.e., more than one-third of stake concentrated on a single provider). The report also observed geographic concentration of validators and stake in the United States and Germany, limited presence in underrepresented regions, and reliance on a single validator client at the time; taken together, NEAR’s aggregated operational Nakamoto coefficient was estimated at ~1.3, indicating elevated susceptibility to correlated infrastructure or jurisdictional failures relative to a more distributed network.
In September 2024, NEAR blockchain drew criticism after its official X (formerly Twitter) account abruptly changed its display name to “it’s all a lie” and posted anti-crypto messages that prompted widespread speculation the account had been hacked. NEAR later indicated the episode was a marketing tactic tied to an upcoming event, which industry commentators and developers criticized as tone-deaf given the prevalence of genuine security breaches in the sector; some argued the stunt risked harming the project’s credibility. During the period of the campaign, Bloomberg reported that NEAR’s token declined by roughly 15% over the preceding week. According to the Bloomberg, also noted that the controversy followed a real security incident in May 2023, when a compromised moderator account on NEAR’s Discord was used to promote a fraudulent airdrop.
