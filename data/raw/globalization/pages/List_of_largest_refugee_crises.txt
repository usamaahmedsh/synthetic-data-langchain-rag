This article provides a list of data to rank the largest refugee crises in modern history by the event(s) that caused them. Only those events that resulted in the creation of at least one million refugees—not including internally displaced persons—are listed below. 
For events for which estimates vary, the geometric mean of the lowest and highest estimates is calculated in order to rank them. As the dates for some events are disputed, the provided data only covers the time since or between the listed years. 
Rows that are highlighted in blue denote crises that are ongoing, as of 2025. Data for these events may be outdated or disputed, and may be adjusted to reflect smaller or larger figures with newer analyses and reports.
