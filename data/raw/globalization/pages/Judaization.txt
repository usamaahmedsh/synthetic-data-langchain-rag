Judaization (Hebrew: ייהוד, Arabic: تهويد) or Judaification is the process of making something Jewish in character. In the context of Zionism, it is often applied to the Israeli expansion of Jewish settlement in areas with significant Palestinian populations, as in the Judaization of Jerusalem, the Galilee, or the Negev. In this context, it is related to de-Arabization. 
In his critique of Zionism, the British thinker Leon Roth argued for a "Judaization of our politics" in response to what he perceived as a "politicization of Judaism" characterized by ethno-nationalism and an almost racial notion of Jewishness.
