An endangered language is a language that it is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an extinct language. UNESCO defines four levels of language endangerment between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":

Vulnerable
Definitely endangered
Severely endangered
Critically endangered
The languages listed below are endangered in Nepal, although they may be vibrant in other countries.
