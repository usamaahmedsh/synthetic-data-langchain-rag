The Mesoamerica Integration and Development Project,  or in Spanish Proyecto Mesoamérica (PM), is a mechanism by which 10 countries centered on Central America implement regional projects for development and integration.  The 10 participating countries are Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama.  The initiative was championed by the then-Mexican President, Vicente Fox.  It is the successor to the Puebla-Panama Plan (PPP) first announced in 2001.  The Mesoamerica Integration and Development Project was launched under that name in 2008.

== History ==
The Puebla-Panama Plan (PPP) was first announced by Mexico's President Vicente Fox on March 12, 2001 and officially launched on June 15, 2001.
In March 2004, Fox officially announced the relaunch of the PPP. Among the changes made were a new emphasis social concerns.
After Felipe Calderón was elected president of Mexico, he continued the project. He had been a proponent of the Mesoamerica Integration and Development Project which was now merged with a similar funding and infrastructure project, the Puebla-Panama Plan (PPP).
The Mesoamerica Integration and Development Project was launched in 2008 by the Heads of State and Government of Colombia, Mexico and Central America during the X Summit of the Tuxtla Dialogue and Consultation Mechanism, thus becoming the technical instance for cooperation and integration within this mechanism.
Calderón expanded the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project, now including Colombia, and has stated that "the challenge (of the mechanism) is to foster democratic practices with solid foundation in the region".
