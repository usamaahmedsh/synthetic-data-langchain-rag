An endangered language is a language that is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an extinct language. A language may be endangered in one area but show signs of revitalisation in another, as with the Irish language.


== Levels of language endangerment ==
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization defines four levels of language endangerment between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":

Vulnerable - "most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home)"
Definitely endangered - "children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home"
Severely endangered - "language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves"
Critically endangered - "the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently"
Extinct - "there are no speakers left; included in the Atlas if presumably extinct since the 1950s"
The list below includes the findings from the third edition of Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger (2010; formerly the Red Book of Endangered Languages), as well as the online edition of that publication, both published by UNESCO.
