== Logo Trademark Dispute ==
The logo currently used by Hyosung, which was designed to represent a large tree and has been in use since 1 May 1981, became involved in a legal dispute due to its similarity to the National Livestock Cooperatives Federation 's logo (established 1 January of the same year) which depicted a bull's head. In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that Hyosung could not use its logo in the financial sector where it overlapped with the National Livestock Cooperatives Federation. However, the dispute was naturally resolved when the National Livestock Cooperatives Federation merged with the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation  in 2000 and discontinued the use of the disputed logo.
