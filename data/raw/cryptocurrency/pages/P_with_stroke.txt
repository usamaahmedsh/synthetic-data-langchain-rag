Ᵽ (minuscule: ᵽ) or "P with stroke" is a letter of the Latin alphabet, formed from P with the addition of a stroke, usually through the bowl but sometimes through the descender. It is used in some phonetic transcription systems, such as the Americanist phonetic notation, to represent a fricative [ɸ].
In 1987 ᵽ was adopted for writing the Tanimuca-Retuarã language, where it represents either a fricative or a stop depending on the dialect.
PotCoin uses a design of the P with stroke as a symbol of its digital cryptocurrency.

There is also a P with stroke through descender Ꝑ (minuscule: ꝑ) used in the medieval period as a scribal abbreviation for per, par-, por-.
