== History ==


=== First generation (2009–2010) ===
Serdar Kuzuloğlu started the Pirate Party of Turkey movement on August 26, 2009. Over the call of Kuzuloğlu, İsmail H. Polat who was busy on a documentary about Pirate Party of Sweden joined the foundation process. After the positive feedback over the open call of the party, the two initiated the organizing process and contacted Pirate Party of Sweden for suggestions. After hearing their experience and gathering their suggestions, the party tried to synthesize the pirate ideology to local culture and finally started the movement on the net. The website and pages in various social media platforms are opened to appeal to the biggest audience possible. In addition to that, a Pirate Bulletin is opened over Google Groups. At the end of 2009, nearly 3.000 people interacted with Pirate Party of Turkey.
After the infighting and overall difficulty of Turkish political party laws, the movement withered away by time.


=== Second generation (2010–2017) ===
Serhat Koç withdrew people who were members of the group by interacting with the Google group of the Pirate Party, which lost its activity after 2010. Following Serhat's 2-year organizing process within the group, the party was introduced to the public under the leadership of Serhat Koç, Şevket Uyanık and Barış Büyükakyol in 2013, and the first open meeting was held on Saturday, on August 10, 2013, at 14:00 for the establishment of the party. As a result of the failure of the establishment of the party like the past Pirate Party period, the existence of the organization as an association and under the name of Pirate Party Movement was accepted by an overwhelming majority. The movement took part in the Open Coalition that prepared the Deputy Integrity Pledge signed by Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu in 2015. During this period, it became clear that the Pirate Party would not compete in the current politics aimed at power, or would not go the traditional right-left distinction, but would direct the politics from outside in line with its principles, adopting a syncretic line when it comes to policies.
The movement was divided into two due to corruption incidents as of 2016, and many people, including Serhat Koç left the organization. Even though several people like Mehmet Şafak Sarı attempted to revive the divided movement during this period, no success was achieved.


=== Third generation (2021–present) ===
The reorganization of the movement came to the fore with the opening of a new Pirate Party Twitter account and website in early 2021. Several netizens belonging to Gen Z contacted some former Pirate Party founders and started a mass refoundation campaign of Pirate Party in Turkey. By participation of various people from different backgrounds, A Refoundation Committee responsible for administration of the party to operate until a proper constitution is formed. The organization is still in process of reorganizing the Pirate Party in Turkey and getting interest of the new generation by following the agenda and participating in youth movements.
