== History ==
CoinJar was co-founded by Asher Tan and Ryan Zhou in May 2013. The company originated in Melbourne, Australia, through a startup accelerator program and secured initial funding from Blackbird Ventures along with contributions from angel investors.
The company is one of the first Australian cryptocurrency exchanges, starting with services that allowed the purchase and sale of Bitcoin, predominantly servicing an Australian user base.
In its early years, CoinJar raised a seed round of A$500,000, with Blackbird Ventures contributing $228,000, which also supported the launch of CoinJar's Bitcoin wallet, initially registering 10,000 users in Australia. CoinJar raised from US-based investors Digital Currency Group in 2017.


== Regulation and Compliance ==
In 2014, CoinJar expanded its business to the United Kingdom.
At an Australian Parliamentary Hearing Committee, CoinJar, noted that the ATO's GST ruling had rendered it 'uncompetitive against non-Australian rivals'. In 2016, the Australian federal government removed the 'double tax' placed on bitcoin transactions.  Despite the regulatory challenges in Australia, CoinJar and other cryptocurrency exchanges in the country expressed a preference for regulatory clarity and licensing regime.
In April 2021, CoinJar was cited among examples of Australian fintechs that have brought their technologies to the UK in Australian Senate Select Committee report on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre.
