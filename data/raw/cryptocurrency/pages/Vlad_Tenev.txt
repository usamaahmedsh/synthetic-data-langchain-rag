Vladimir Tenev (Bulgarian: Владимир Тенев; born 13 February 1987) is an American entrepreneur who is most notably the co-founder (with Baiju Bhatt), Chairman, and CEO of Robinhood, a US-based financial technology services company.
Tenev moved to the United States from his native Bulgaria at the age of five. After studying mathematics at Stanford and UCLA and getting a master's degree, he decided to partner with Baiju Bhatt to create several fintech startups. One of them, Robinhood, became a publicly-traded multibillion-dollar company.
As of July 2025, Tenev has a net worth of $6 billion. This is largely due to his over 6% stake at Robinhood as well as cryptocurrency investments.


== Early life and education ==
Tenev was born in Varna, Bulgaria. When he was a toddler, his parents migrated to the U.S. leaving him with his grandparents before he joined them when he was five. His parents both worked for the World Bank. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia, to which he later donated $125,000.
He earned a bachelor's of science degree in mathematics from Stanford University, where he met Baiju Bhatt. He was a member of a fraternity at Stanford. In 2008, he earned a master's degree in mathematics from the University of California in Los Angeles, and originally intended to study for a PhD in mathematics at UCLA and pursue a career in academia. He instead dropped out to work with Bhatt.

=== Early career ===
In 2010, Tenev and Baiju Bhatt started a high-frequency trading software company called Celeris, based in New York. By January 2011 they abandoned it to create Chronos Research, which sold low-latency software to other trading firms and banks. Later in 2011, they moved to California.


=== Robinhood ===

In 2013, Tenev and Bhatt co-founded the trading platform Robinhood. In 2015, Robinhood launched its mobile app to the public. Following a funding round in May 2018 which increased Robinhood's valuation to $6 billion, Tenev and Bhatt became billionaires.
In November 2020, Tenev became the sole CEO of Robinhood, having previously shared the co-CEO title with Bhatt. The next year, Robinhood debuted on the stock market. The initial public offering (IPO) for the company placed it at a $32 billion valuation.


=== GameStop short squeeze ===

By 2021, Robinhood was an app often used by individual investors at or reading the r/wallstreetbets subreddit to execute short squeezes on companies such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment. As a result, the targeted companies' stock experienced huge price volatility. On January 28, 2021, Robinhood was among a number of brokerages that stopped offering users to buy stock or options of affected companies. The company explained that it could not meet federal clearinghouse deposit requirements and so had to restrict trading, and Tenev defended Robinhood's actions.
The decision sparked widespread criticism from users of the app as well as politicians in both major American parties, who alleged that Robinhood did so to protect institutional investors from incurring losses instead of the stated goal of democratizing stock market investment. On 18 February, Tenev testified before the United States House Committee on Financial Services to explain Robinhood's actions. He apologized for the suspension of trading but, even though the lawmakers seemed unsatisfied with Tenev's answers, he stated that he did nothing wrong. In July 2021, in connection with the controversy, Robinhood disclosed during the IPO  that the US Attorney's Office had executed a search warrant for Tenev's cell phone as part of a probe into the GameStop short squeeze.
Sebastian Stan portrayed Tenev in the 2023 film Dumb Money, a drama about the GameStop short squeeze.


=== Other activities ===
Tenev co-founded Palo Alto-based artificial intelligence startup Harmonic in 2023, where he is the executive chairman. Its aim is to reduce AI hallucinations by generating and checking Lean code, and also to improve AI's mathematical skills.
