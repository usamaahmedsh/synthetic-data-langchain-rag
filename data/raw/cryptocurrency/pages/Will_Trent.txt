== Premise ==
Abandoned as a child, Will Trent grew up in the Atlanta foster care system.  This had a lasting effect on him and, despite being dyslexic, he became a Special Agent in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). Will is highly observant, solving the highest proportion of cases in the GBI, which causes some envy.
Will had been assigned a corruption case involving the Atlanta Police Department, which shares an office building with the GBI. Solving it resulted in the arrest of several APD officers. Amanda Wagner, his boss at the GBI, assigns Faith Mitchell, the disgruntled daughter of an arrested APD officer, temporary GBI status as Will's partner.
He is in an on-again off-again relationship with APD Detective Angie Polaski, his childhood friend from the foster care system. Angie is partnered with APD Detective Michael Ormewood. Will and Angie's cases sometimes overlap, bringing the two and their partners into ongoing contact.
