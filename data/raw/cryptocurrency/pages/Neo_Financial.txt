Neo Financial is a Canadian financial technology company headquartered in Calgary. Neo develops consumer banking products in partnership with regulated financial institutions and provides co-branded credit and loyalty programs to Canadian retailers. 


== History ==
Neo Financial was founded in 2019 by former SkipTheDishes executives Andrew Chau, Jeff Adamson, Kris Read, and Chris Simair
In January 2021 Neo launched a savings account program using Concentra Bank as its deposit-holding partner, ensuring coverage through the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC). In 2024 Neo transitioned to Peoples Bank of Canada as its partner for new and existing everyday accounts.
In 2022, the company expanded in Calgary with new offices in the Edison tower and the Hudson’s Bay building. Neo maintains a secondary headquarters in Winnipeg, supported by a provincial expansion grant.


== Products and services ==
Neo offers credit cards, savings and cash accounts, and investment products delivered through its mobile app and website.


=== Credit cards and partnerships ===
Neo issues consumer credit cards and co-branded programs. In 2021 it partnered with Hudson’s Bay to launch a new Hudson’s Bay Mastercard. After Hudson’s Bay entered liquidation in 2025, cardholders were notified that accounts would transition to a Neo-branded card.
In 2023 Tim Hortons introduced the no-annual-fee Tims Mastercard, developed through Neo’s embedded banking platform and issued by ATB Financial.


=== Savings and investing ===
Neo’s deposit accounts are backed by partner banks with CDIC insurance. Its investing product, Neo Invest, was launched with embedded wealth services provider OneVest in 2022.


== Funding ==
Neo has raised multiple venture rounds. In May 2022 the company announced a 145 million dollar Series C led by Valar Ventures, which valued the firm above one billion Canadian dollars and coincided with surpassing one million customers. 
In November 2024 Neo raised 360 million Canadian dollars in a Series D round composed of equity and debt financing, with participation from existing investors and notable angels.


== Reception ==
Neo has faced some negative public reception as customer complaints have been widely documented. The Better Business Bureau assigns Neo Financial an F rating and notes that the company is not accredited; the profile cites unresolved service complaints and delays in issue resolution. Similar concerns appear in financial discussion forums, where users have described fraud-related disputes and dissatisfaction with dispute resolution processes.
There have been other concerns raised regarding regulation and ownership. Neo operates as a financial technology company using partner banks rather than as a licensed bank, raising questions about consumer protection compared to traditional deposit-taking institutions. 
In 2024 Neo’s Series D financing attracted scrutiny because it included investment from Tencent, a Chinese technology conglomerate that appears on a United States Department of Defense list of companies with alleged military ties. Canadian outlets reported that this raised national-security questions in the context of pending Retail Payments Activities Act oversight.


=== Industry recognition ===
Neo Financial has received recognition for its expansion and technological innovation. In 2023, it ranked first in Deloitte’s Technology Fast 50 Companies-to-Watch category, having a revenue growth of 81,732 percent between 2020 and 2022, while expanding its team from roughly 120 to over 700 employees.
In the following year, Neo was ranked first on the main Technology Fast 50 ranking, achieving a three-year revenue growth of 154,022 percent.


== Regulation ==
Neo operates as a fintech firm while relying on partner banks for regulated services. It has been registered as a money services business with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada since November 8, 2022.
