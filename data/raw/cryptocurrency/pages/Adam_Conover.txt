== Career ==
In 2012, Conover began working as a sketch comedy writer and performer for the comedy website and YouTube channel CollegeHumor, where he eventually created the web series that would go on to become Adam Ruins Everything on TruTV. The first episode of the TruTV show, which aims to reveal untold truths and to dispel common misconceptions, premiered on September 29, 2015. Conover has said his character in the show is a comedic interpretation of the person he worries he once was or is. As he told The New York Observer, "It's the reaction I’ve gotten my whole life: that I learn something and try to tell people in conversation, but when I tell them, they are annoyed."

In March 2016, he was asked to speak at a marketing conference on the subject of millennials; the talk he gave was entitled "Millennials Don't Exist". In 2018, Conover was the headliner of the first night of the annual CSICon conference for skeptics. On August 17, 2018, Conover was a guest on Real Time with Bill Maher. On April 17, 2019, Conover was a guest on The Joe Rogan Experience.
He has voiced several characters in the Netflix animated series BoJack Horseman, including A Ryan Seacrest Type, one of the Paparazzi Birds, and Bradley Hitler-Smith. In 2019, he voiced the character Big_Hairy_Stallion_69 on the Netflix series Tuca & Bertie, and created the new Earwolf podcast Factually!
Since 2020, Conover has also acted as the host of an American adaptation of the family game show The Crystal Maze for Nickelodeon. In November 2020, Conover had a cameo appearance as his character from Adam Ruins Everything in The Eric Andre Show. His character appeared in the show's opening sequence before being beaten to death. In December 2020, Conover announced that Adam Ruins Everything was no longer in production and that he was planning a new Netflix series about the federal government called The G Word with Adam Conover. The show premiered on Netflix on May 19, 2022.

Conover serves on the board of the Writers Guild of America West, and sits on the 2023 WGA contract negotiating committee. On May 1, 2023 the WGA contract negotiating committee failed to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major film and television studios of Hollywood, triggering a strike.
In 2025, Conover released a video promoting the cryptocurrency project World Network. He subsequently released an apology video, said he would not accept any further money from World, and called World's Orb "the creepiest tech product Silicon Valley has ever produced" which had been "a flaming dumpster fire of a product launch".
