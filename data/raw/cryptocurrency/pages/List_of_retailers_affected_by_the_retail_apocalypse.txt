Liquidity was raised to about $1 billion after a loan and additional financing were secured. Bed Bath & Beyond's stock was also down on the market by 28%. Analysts warned that the company was teetering on the edge of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, citing that it could be too late to turn things around and that the company could default on its debt.

On September 9, 2024, Big Lots filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, planning to close additional stores upon being sold to its new owner, Nexus Capital Management LP. 50 of those additional stores were named in October, and another 56 were named within the month as well. While some closures ramped up, other locations cancelled liquidation sales and resumed regular operations. On December 19, 2024, Big Lots announced via a press release that its sale to Nexus fell through, and all 963 of its remaining stores would immediately begin going out of business. However, on December 28, 2024, Gordon Brothers, the company handling the liquidation sales, reached an agreement to sell up to 400 stores, two distribution centers, and intellectual property to Variety Wholesalers, which operates over 400 retail stores in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. under various banners; Variety Wholesalers plans to continue operating the acquired stores under the Big Lots brand and retain up to 10,000 employees.
