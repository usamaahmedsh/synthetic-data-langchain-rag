The 2022 United States House of Representatives elections in New York were held on November 8, 2022, to elect the 26 U.S. representatives from the State of New York, one from each of the state's 26 congressional districts. The elections coincided with elections for governor, U.S. Senate, attorney general, comptroller, state senate, and assembly, and various other state and local elections.
Following the 2020 census, New York lost one seat in the U.S. House. Incumbent representatives Lee Zeldin (R), Thomas Suozzi (D), Kathleen Rice (D), John Katko (R), Chris Jacobs (R), and Joe Sempolinski (R) retired. Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D) and Mondaire Jones (D) lost renomination in their primary contests. The primary elections were set to happen on June 28, but due to a court-ordered redraw of the state's Congressional maps, they were held on August 23. Due in part to Kathy Hochul's relatively weak performance in the governor's race and heavy pro-Republican turnout, the Democratic Party lost four seats.
With 11 seats held, this is the most seats won by Republicans since 2000 and the best performance in the popular vote since 2002.


== 2020–22 redistricting controversy ==
Following the 2020 census, New York lost one Congressional seat and its Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) attempted to draw a new map. However they could not reach an agreement on the map, and the Democratic-dominated New York State Legislature drew their own new Congressional map. In April 2022, in the lead-up to the 2022 midterms, the New York State Court of Appeals struck down the map, known infamously as the "Hochulmander" (named after New York State Governor Kathy Hochul) as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that failed to follow the proper procedures. The court then assigned an Independent Special Master to create a new map. In the 2022 House election in New York, under the new map, the Republican Party flipped three seats, bringing the new seat count of 15 for the Democrats and 11 held by Republicans. The court-drawn map is often credited with helping the Republican Party win back control of the House, due to the narrow margin of the Republican majority.


== Overview ==
In some races, candidates appeared on multiple ballot lines, with Democratic candidates often appearing on the Working Families line and Republican candidates often appearing on the Conservative line. However, they all caucus with either the Democrats or the Republicans.


=== By district ===
Candidates on multiple ballot lines are marked as the party they caucus with.


== District 1 ==

The 1st district is based on the eastern end and North Shore of Long Island, including the Hamptons, the North Fork, Riverhead, Port Jefferson, Smithtown, and Huntington, all in Suffolk County. Due to redistricting, the district lost most of Brookhaven to the 2nd district and picked up Huntington from the 3rd district. The district had a PVI of R+4 but voted for Joe Biden by 0.2 points in 2020. The incumbent was Republican Lee Zeldin, who was reelected with 54.8% of the vote in 2020. He was retiring to run for governor.
Republicans chose their nominee, Nick LaLota, to succeed Zeldin in a three-way primary in late August, the endorsed candidate of their county committee. The primary looked to be a race between him and Anthony Figliola, a former Brookhaven deputy supervisor who argued his independence from the county party leadership made him the better choice, until Michelle Bond, head of the Association for Digital Asset Marketing, a cryptocurrency trade group, filed petitions to run right before the deadline. Ultimately, LaLota won the primary with 47 percent of the vote. Bond finished with 28 percent to Figliola's 25 percent.

== District 2 ==

The 2nd district is based on the South Shore of Suffolk County, including the towns of Babylon, Islip, and most of Brookhaven all in Suffolk County, and a small part of Oyster Bay in Nassau County. Due to redistricting, the district lost portions of Nassau County and now stretches farther east along the South Shore. The district had a PVI of R+4 and voted for Donald Trump by 1.5 points in 2020. The incumbent was Republican Andrew Garbarino, who was elected with 52.9% of the vote in 2020.

== District 3 ==

The 3rd district is based on the North Shore of Nassau County, including all of the towns of North Hempstead and Glen Cove, most of the town of Oyster Bay, and a small part of Hempstead, and parts of Northeast Queens, including the neighborhoods of Whitestone, Beechhurst, Little Neck, and Douglaston. Due to redistricting, the district lost Huntington to the 1st district. It had a PVI of D+2 and voted for Joe Biden by 8 points in 2020. The incumbent was Democrat Tom Suozzi, who was reelected with 55.9% of the vote in 2020. Suozzi declined to run for reelection, instead opting to run for governor.
In the general election, Republican George Santos defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman by 7%, considered an upset in this Democratic-leaning district. On December 19, 2022, The New York Times published an article reporting that Santos had allegedly misrepresented many aspects of his life and career, including his education and employment history. An attorney for Santos said the report was a "smear" and "defamatory" but did not address the report's substance. Santos did not produce any documents to substantiate his claims, despite several requests from the Times to do so. Other news organizations confirmed and elaborated on the Times's reporting. Gerard Kassar, chair of the Conservative Party of New York State, said: "I've never seen anything like this. His entire life seems to be made up. Everything about him is fraudulent."
In the wake of the disclosures about Santos, commentators expressed amazement that no one, save the local North Shore Leader and opposition research by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had raised questions about Santos's background during the campaign. It was speculated that if what the Times reported had been public knowledge before the election, Santos would have lost. However, FiveThirtyEight said that was "unclear", noting that the other two Republican candidates on the ballot district-wide, Lee Zeldin and Joe Pinion, had also carried the district. Zeldin carried the 3rd District by 12 points in the 2022 New York gubernatorial election. Pinion carried the district by 4 points in the 2022 United States Senate election in New York, despite his campaign having been minimally funded. The site has found that pre-election scandals have on average cost candidates about 9 percentage points of the vote that they might otherwise have received, and while that might have been enough to throw the election to Zimmerman, "a scandal's impact varies quite a bit from election to election. So we can't just subtract 9 points from that margin and assume that would have been the result if voters had been aware of his deceptions." Nathaniel Rakich observed that "in this era of high partisan polarization, scandals may hurt candidates less than they used to."

== District 17 ==

Prior to redistricting, the 17th district included all of Rockland County and portions of Westchester County. Following redistricting, the 17th district includes all of Putnam and Rockland Counties, northern Westchester County, and a small part of Dutchess County. The district voted for Joe Biden by 10 points in 2020.
The incumbent in the 17th district was Democrat Mondaire Jones. However, the redrawn 17th district included the residence of Sean Patrick Maloney, the Democratic incumbent in the neighboring 18th district and chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. According to The Guardian, "Maloney decided to run in New York’s 17th congressional district rather than his longtime, more urban, 18th district, even though that meant booting out the newer Mondaire Jones, his fellow Democrat and the incumbent congressman in the 17th district". When Maloney announced his intention to run in the redrawn 17th district, Jones opted not to challenge Maloney; instead, on May 20, 2022, Jones announced that he would seek election in the Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn-based 10th district. Jones finished third in the Democratic primary in the 10th district. Jones had been elected to his 17th district seat with 59.3% of the vote in 2020, while Maloney had been reelected to the neighboring 18th district with 55.8% of the vote in 2020. Maloney's decision to seek election in the 17th district "angered many within his party" and "was considered controversial given Maloney’s role as the chair of the House Democrats’ campaign arm was to boost incumbents and protect the Democrats’ majority in the lower chamber". According to The Hill, Maloney's decision "infuriated Jones and his allies, particularly those in the Congressional Black Caucus, who accused Maloney of putting his own political survival over the interests of the party".
Displeased with Maloney's decision to seek election in the district represented by Jones, progressive state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi opted to challenge Maloney in a Democratic primary. Maloney defeated Biaggi by a wide margin. Republican Assemblymember Mike Lawler easily defeated four other candidates in a Republican primary.
Leading up to Election Day, Maloney "set off on a Europe trip, where he hung out on a balcony overlooking the Seine, and turned up in London, Paris, and Geneva, often alongside congressman Adam Schiff, for gatherings billed as DCCC fundraising events". Maloney also dismissed Republican campaign spending in the district as "'lighting [money] on fire'". Maloney "spent the election cycle using funds and Washington knowhow to shore up vulnerable Democrats across the country", but "had to rush back to his own district for frantic campaigning when it emerged that he, too, was suddenly vulnerable".
After running a campaign that focused on crime and inflation, Lawler narrowly defeated Maloney in the general election. Lawler’s victory marked "the first general election defeat for a campaign chair of either party since 1980". Maloney's defeat was "a major upset" and "a humiliating loss for Democrats". Maloney's loss, together with other Republican wins in New York districts, helped Republicans win a majority in the House of Representatives in 2022.

== District 18 ==

The 18th district is based in the mid-Hudson Valley, including all of Orange County and most of Dutchess and Ulster Counties. The seat was modestly altered due to redistricting, losing all of Putnam County and parts of Westchester County to the 17th district while picking up the portions of Dutchess and Ulster Counties formerly in the 19th district. The district had a PVI of D+1 and voted for Joe Biden by 8 points in 2020. The incumbents were Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney, who was reelected with 55.8% of the vote in 2020, and Democrat Pat Ryan, who was first elected in 2022 in a special election with 51.2% of the vote. Maloney ran for reelection in the neighboring 17th district instead, while Pat Ryan ran for reelection in this district. In the general election Pat Ryan narrowly beat Schmitt, with Schmitt conceding defeat. After the election, it became public that a Democrat-aligned group had tried to request Schmitt's military records without authorization.

The 19th district stretches from the Upper Hudson Valley across the Catskill Mountains to parts of the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes, including Hudson, Woodstock, Monticello, Oneonta, Binghamton, and Ithaca. It includes all of Columbia, Greene, Sullivan, Delaware, Chenango, Cortland, Broome, Tioga, and Tompkins counties, and parts of Otsego and Ulster Counties. The district was modestly altered by redistricting, losing all of its territory in Dutchess County and most of its territory in Ulster County in exchange for Binghamton and Ithaca. The district had an even PVI and voted for Joe Biden by 5 points in 2020. The incumbent was Democrat Antonio Delgado, who was reelected with 54.8% of the vote in 2020. However, on May 3, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul announced her intention to appoint Delgado to the vacant lieutenant governor position, triggering a special election that Democrat Pat Ryan won with 51.2% of the vote. Ryan was then redistricted into the neighboring 18th district, leaving this seat open.

== District 23 ==

District 23 is based in the Southern Tier and Western New York, including Elmira, Corning, Jamestown, and outer Erie County. Due to redistricting, the district lost parts of the Finger Lakes such as Ithaca while picking up parts of Erie County formerly in the 27th district. The district had a PVI of R+12 and voted for Donald Trump by 17 points in 2020. The district's two incumbents, both Republicans, both declined to run for reelection: Joe Sempolinski, who was elected in August 2022 to fulfill the remaining term caused by Tom Reed's resignation, specifically ran for the seat as a placeholder and not as a permanent representative; and Chris Jacobs, of the old 27th district, announced that he would no longer seek election to the seat after his comments in support of gun control in the wake of the Robb Elementary School shooting upset many other Republicans and drew threats of primary challengers.
