Epic! is an American kids subscription-based reading and learning platform. It offers access to books and videos targeted at children ages 12 and under. The service can be used on desktop and mobile devices.
Epic! was founded in 2013 by Suren Markosian and Kevin Donahue and launched in 2014. Indian educational technology company Byju's acquired Epic! in July 2021 in a cash and stock deal worth $500 million.
On January 25, 2024, lenders began bankruptcy proceedings against Epic's parent company Byju's in an effort to repay its loans. On February 1, 2024, Byju's U.S. division filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. Byju's would raise around $200 million in an effort to clear "immediate liabilities" and for other operational costs.
