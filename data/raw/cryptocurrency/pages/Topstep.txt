Topstep is a financial technology company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois and founded by Michael Patak. It specializes in evaluating the performance of day traders through real-time simulated trading accounts. Originally founded as TopstepTrader, the company rebranded as Topstep in 2020 following a merger.
Traders who pass the company's evaluation process, called the Trading Combine, earn a funded trading account and trade futures contracts in the financial markets using the firm's capital.


== History ==
Topstep was founded by Michael Patak, the current CEO and a former Dow futures contracts floor trader, on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade. The company was established as a Limited liability company (LLC) in July 2012. According to the Omaha World-Herald, the name TopstepTrader was chosen because the best traders within each trading pit stand on the top step, where they have the best view and could theoretically receive the best market prices.
In 2017, Inc. Magazine ranked Topstep No. 1,261 on its 36th annual Inc. 5000.


== Products and services ==
Topstep's funding process consists of three steps. The first step measures the trader's profitability, while the second step evaluates the trader's risk management. After passing these two steps, the trader earns a "Funded Account", in which they can trade futures backed by Topstep's proprietary capital. The process was loosely based on NFL Scouting Combines.
As of April 12, 2022, Topstep discontinued its Forex trading program to focus on its futures trading program. Topstep's primary trading platforms are Ninjatrader and Quantower, both of which use the Rithmic data feed for routing orders to the futures markets.


== Awards ==
Topstep has been awarded 101 Best and Brightest Companies to Work For in 2016, 2016 Chicago Innovation Awards Finalist, and 2016 FIA (Futures Industry Association) Innovator. Founder and CEO Michael Patak was a semi-finalist in 2015 and a finalist in 2016 for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
