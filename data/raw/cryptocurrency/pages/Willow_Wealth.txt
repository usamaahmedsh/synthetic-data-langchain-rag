Willow Wealth Inc. (formerly Yieldstreet) is an American financial technology company headquartered in New York City that operates an online platform for alternative investments. The platform enables accredited investors and retail investors to access private market asset classes including real estate, private credit, private equity, art, and legal finance. As of 2025, the platform reports more than 500,000 members and over $6 billion in cumulative investments.


== History ==
The company was founded in 2015 as Yieldstreet by Milind Mehere, a co-founder of Yodle, and Michael Weisz, who had held leadership roles in specialty finance firms. It positioned itself as a platform to provide retail investors access to alternative investments traditionally available only to institutions and wealthy individuals.
In April 2019, the company acquired Athena Art Finance from The Carlyle Group for $170 million, expanding into art-secured lending. Later that year, it acquired WealthFlex to integrate self-directed IRA capabilities. In November 2023, the company acquired Cadre, an online real estate investment platform.
The company has raised approximately $800 million in total funding from investors including Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital, and Greycroft. In July 2025, the company closed a $77 million funding round led by Tarsadia Investments, with participation from RedBird Capital Partners, Mayfair Equity Partners, Edison Partners, and Kingfisher Investment Advisors.
In late 2025, the company rebranded to Willow Wealth, stating the new name reflected its expanded product offerings and ten years of experience in private markets.


== Products and services ==
Willow Wealth operates as an online marketplace connecting investors with alternative investment opportunities across ten asset classes. The platform offers both individual investment opportunities and pooled fund structures. Most investments require accredited investor status, though certain products such as the Alternative Income Fund are available to non-accredited investors.
The Alternative Income Fund launched in March 2020 as a multi-asset closed-end fund with quarterly distributions, offering exposure to more than 50 income-focused investments. In November 2021, the company introduced the Art Equity Platform for fractional investment in post-war and contemporary art.
In August 2025, the company launched Willow 360, an automated managed portfolio solution developed in partnership with Wilshire Associates, offering diversified exposure to private markets with quarterly liquidity.
In December 2025, Willow Wealth announced partnerships with Carlyle Group, Goldman Sachs, and StepStone Group to offer access to private credit funds with minimum investments of $10,000.


== Competitors ==
Willow Wealth operates in the alternative investment platform sector alongside competitors including Fundrise, CrowdStreet, Percent, and RealtyMogul. Compared to Fundrise, which focuses primarily on real estate and has minimum investments starting at $10, Willow Wealth offers a broader range of asset classes but generally requires higher minimums and accredited investor status for most offerings.


== Criticism ==
The company has faced regulatory scrutiny and investor losses related to certain investment offerings. In 2020, an $89 million marine investment portfolio tied to vessel deconstruction loans defaulted. In September 2023, the company paid $1.9 million to settle SEC charges related to disclosure failures in those investments.
In 2025, CNBC reported on distress in the company's real estate portfolio, its largest asset class, noting defaults and underperformance across multiple offerings made between 2021 and 2024.
