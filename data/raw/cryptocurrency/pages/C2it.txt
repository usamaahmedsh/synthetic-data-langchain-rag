C2it was a person-to-person money transfer service established by Citibank in 2000 as a competitor to PayPal and Billpoint. It was formed as a partnership with AOL, and later with Compuserve and Microsoft.
The service was discontinued in November 2003, due to low usage; a 2002 Gartner survey indicated that of various online money transfer methods, only 1 percent said they used C2it vs 33 percent who used PayPal.
