== History ==
FreedomPay was founded by Thomas Durovsik in 2000.
In 2007, FreedomPay developed a gateway for credit card processing (FreeWay) that captures detailed transaction data. That data can be mined for real time intelligence from disparate systems, giving merchants insight into their sales. Using that data, FreedomPay launched a cloud-based platform as a service (PaaS) and a first generation incentive platform.
In 2013, FreedomPay was selected by Microsoft as its commerce platform partner for the global banking and retail sectors.
In 2014, FreedomPay earned PCI validation for its point-to-point encryption solution (P2PE). FreedomPay was the first fully functional platform solution in North America to achieve PCI validation, including support for NFC and EMV payments.
In 2023, Amazon Web Services integrated Amazon One with the company’s commerce technology platform.
Partners with QikServe (since 2018), J.P. Morgan, Elavon (2024), Citi Teams, and WorldPay.
