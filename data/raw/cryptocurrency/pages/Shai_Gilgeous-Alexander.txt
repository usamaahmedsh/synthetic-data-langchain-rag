Shaivonte Aician "Shai" Gilgeous-Alexander ( SHAY GHIL-jəs; born July 12, 1998), also known by his initials SGA, is a Canadian professional basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is a three-time NBA All-Star, a three-time All-NBA First Team member, and was named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the 2024–25 NBA season. During that season, Gilgeous-Alexander also led the Thunder to their first NBA championship since relocating from Seattle to Oklahoma City, becoming the 11th Canadian to win an NBA title.
Gilgeous-Alexander played one season of college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats. He was selected 11th overall by the Charlotte Hornets in the first round of the 2018 NBA draft before being traded to the Los Angeles Clippers on draft night. In his rookie season with the Clippers, Gilgeous-Alexander made an appearance in the 2019 NBA playoffs and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. Following his rookie season, he was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in July 2019.
In his first season with the Thunder, Gilgeous-Alexander was their leading scorer and led the team to the 2020 NBA playoffs as the fifth seed. After dealing with injuries over the next two seasons, he was named to his first NBA All-Star Game and was voted to the All-NBA First Team in 2023, finishing fourth in the league in scoring with 31.4 points per game. In the 2024–25 NBA season, Gilgeous-Alexander won the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after leading the league in scoring with an average of 32.7 points per game. He later won the NBA Finals MVP award as the Thunder won the 2025 NBA Finals, becoming the fourth player in NBA history to win the MVP award, Finals MVP award, and scoring title all in the same season. Additionally, Gilgeous-Alexander became the second Canadian to win the MVP award, following Steve Nash, who first claimed it in back-to-back seasons in 2005 and 2006, and the first Canadian ever to win the Finals MVP award.
With the Canada men's national basketball team, Gilgeous-Alexander won the bronze medal at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup and was named to the All-Tournament Team. In 2023, he received the Northern Star Award as Canada's Athlete of the Year, becoming only the second basketball player to earn the award since Steve Nash first won it in 2005.


== Early life ==
Gilgeous-Alexander was born on July 12, 1998, in Toronto, Ontario, and grew up in nearby Hamilton. His mother, Charmaine Gilgeous, is a former professional track athlete who competed in the women's 400 metres for Antigua and Barbuda at the 1992 Summer Olympics. His father, Vaughn Alexander, also of Antiguan descent, played high school basketball and won a Toronto city championship while attending Georges Vanier Secondary School in the early 1990s. Gilgeous-Alexander's father coached him during his youth. He began high school in Hamilton at St. Thomas More Catholic Secondary School before transferring to nearby Sir Allan MacNab Secondary School. He later moved to the United States and attended Hamilton Heights Christian Academy in Chattanooga, Tennessee, for his junior and senior years to improve his basketball skills, graduating in 2017.


== High school career ==
Gilgeous-Alexander initially attended St. Thomas More Catholic Secondary School in Hamilton, Ontario. In ninth grade, he did not make the school's junior team and subsequently played on the midget squad, where he was named team MVP and led St. Thomas More to the midget boys' city championship. Gilgeous-Alexander then transferred to nearby Sir Allan MacNab Secondary School before relocating to the United States in 2015 to attend Hamilton Heights Christian Academy in Chattanooga, Tennessee. "I just thought I needed to play better competition," he said. In his senior season, Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 18.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game.
In early 2016, he participated in the Basketball Without Borders development camp.
A four-star recruit according to ESPN, Gilgeous-Alexander verbally committed to play college basketball for the Florida Gators in November 2015 before decommitting in October 2016. His final five schools were Kansas, Kentucky, Syracuse, Texas, and UNLV. The following month, Gilgeous-Alexander announced his decision to play for the Kentucky Wildcats after signing his national letter of intent on November 14, 2016. He participated in the 2017 Kentucky Derby Festival Basketball Classic and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP). At the 2017 Nike Hoop Summit, Gilgeous-Alexander represented the World Select Team and scored 11 points in 21 minutes of play.


== College career ==
Gilgeous-Alexander started the 2017–18 season with the Kentucky Wildcats as a reserve, sitting behind freshman point guard Quade Green, but still averaged over 30 minutes per game. After a loss to UCLA, Alexander recorded 24 points, five rebounds, and four assists against Louisville on December 29, 2017. When he first stepped on the University of Kentucky's campus, Gilgeous-Alexander had long hair. However, he cut his hair early in the season and some say this started his progression from sixth man to starting point guard. He continued to lead the team for the following two games, scoring 21 points against Georgia and 18 against LSU. He was a consistent contributor to a "struggling" Kentucky team that had a four-game losing streak during the season. He became a starter along with four other freshmen: Hamidou Diallo, Nick Richards, Kevin Knox II, and P. J. Washington. Despite their losses, his PPG shot up to 12.9 along with 3.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists. Gilgeous-Alexander had a great SEC tournament, earning Most Valuable Player (MVP) honours, and continued that momentum into the NCAA tournament. After playing great basketball in the first two rounds against Davidson and Buffalo, Kentucky lost to Kansas State in the Sweet 16. Gilgeous-Alexander's final college basketball moment was a missed three-point attempt at the buzzer. He concluded his freshman season and, consequently, his college career, having played 37 games with 24 starts, averaging 14.4 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game while shooting 48.5 percent from the field. After the 2017–18 season, Gilgeous-Alexander declared for the 2018 NBA draft on April 9, 2018.

This made the Thunder the first team in NBA history to play double overtime in the first two games of a season. His 55 points were the third-highest in franchise history since the team's relocation from Seattle to Oklahoma City in 2008, and tied Russell Westbrook for the most 50-point games in franchise history with five. Across these two games, his combined 40 free throw attempts set an NBA record for most attempts through the first two games of a season, while his combined 90 points ranked fifth most in NBA history through the first two games of a season, trailing only Wilt Chamberlain, Anthony Davis, and Michael Jordan.

== National team career ==

Gilgeous-Alexander represented the Canada men's junior national basketball team at the 2016 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship in Valdivia, Chile. He played in all five games of the tournament, averaging 7.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game while shooting 39.4 percent from the field. The team won the silver medal following a 99–84 loss to the United States in the final. Later that year, Gilgeous-Alexander joined the senior men's national basketball team for the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Manila, Philippines. Canada lost to France in the final and failed to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics.
Gilgeous-Alexander was one of 14 players to agree to a three-year commitment to play with the national team on May 24, 2022, aiming to break a decades-long trend of failing to qualify for the Olympic basketball tournament. At the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, Gilgeous-Alexander was the central figure on the Canadian roster, leading them on a historic deep run. They qualified to the quarter-finals of the tournament on September 3, in the process securing a berth at the 2024 Summer Olympics, which he called "almost indescribable." The team ultimately won the bronze medal after defeating the United States in the third-place game. This was Canada's first ever World Cup medal, and first medal at a major global tournament since the 1936 Summer Olympics. In recognition of his individual play, Gilgeous-Alexander was named to the All-Tournament Team. For both this and his feats in the NBA in 2023, he received the Northern Star Award as Canada's Athlete of the Year and the Lionel Conacher Award as the Canadian Press' choice for Canadian Male Athlete of the Year. Gilgeous-Alexander was only the second basketball player to receive the two honours, in both cases after Steve Nash.
Gilgeous-Alexander was named to Canada's roster for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. After a strong unbeaten performance in the group stage, which was deemed the "group of death" by experts, Canada was surprisingly eliminated in the quarterfinals by hosts France. Gilgeous-Alexander was named to the tournament's All-Second Team after averaging 21.0 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game.


== Player profile ==
Listed at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) tall and weighing 195 pounds (88.5 kg), Gilgeous-Alexander is a combo guard known for his ability to slash through defenses and score on all three levels. His 6-foot 11 inch (2.11 m) wingspan, body control, speed, and embrace of defensive contact make him one of the best slashers in the history of the NBA, boasting a 68 percent career field goal percentage within three feet of the basket.  
Though he has yet to receive an All-Defensive Team selection, Gilgeous-Alexander is regarded as a solid two-way player, known for his ability to jump passing lanes and block shots as a guard. He earned All-Defensive Team votes from 2023 to 2025 and placing 7th in the voting for the 2024 Defensive Player of the Year Award.
Gilgeous-Alexander has earned widespread praise across the NBA for his leadership, work ethic, and maturity. Former teammates Patrick Beverley and Chris Paul recognized his relentless work ethic and dedication to the game from beginning of his career, with Beverley comparing Gilgeous-Alexander's mindset to the likes of Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault has praised Gilgeous-Alexander for his composure and selflessness, highlighting how he leads by example on and off the court. 
Gilgeous-Alexander has faced heavy fan criticism on social media for his high free throw numbers and tendency to embellish contact when driving. He led the NBA in total free throws made from the 2022–23 season to the 2024–25 season, though he has never led in free throws attempted. Former NBA player Richard Jefferson addressed the narrative of Gilgeous-Alexander being a "free-throw merchant" to discredit his offensive prowess, saying, "Shai is one of the most impressive people that I've ever talked to. I asked him about the free throws, and he's like, 'Yeah. You know what's crazy about it is that two years ago, I averaged almost 11 free throws a game but we finished 10th and no one cared. When I wasn't sending their best favourite player home when I wasn't sending their team home, then no one cared that I was shooting 11 free throws a night and scoring this amount of points.' To me, this is the type of sickos that we love."

== Endorsements ==
Gilgeous-Alexander signed an endorsement deal with Converse on July 8, 2020. According to the Netflix docuseries Power Moves with Shaquille O'Neal, O'Neal attempted to sign Gilgeous-Alexander to Reebok as his initial shoe contract was set to expire at the conclusion of the 2023–24 NBA season.

== Legal issues ==
Gilgeous-Alexander purchased a lakefront property in Burlington, Ontario, in May 2023, which had previously been occupied by bankrupt cryptocurrency trader Aiden Pleterski. Within days of moving in, Gilgeous-Alexander and his partner vacated the residence due to ongoing security concerns related to Pleterski's highly publicized fraud and bankruptcy case, which had led to threats and repeated visits from investors seeking Pleterski. Gilgeous-Alexander subsequently filed a lawsuit to rescind the purchase, alleging that the seller, who had leased the property to Pleterski, failed to disclose the property's connection to the trader and the associated safety risks. The court ruled in favour of Gilgeous-Alexander, finding fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of the seller and awarded him damages for mortgage and insurance payments incurred. Consequently, the purchase was reversed, and the seller's appeal was denied. The case set a precedent in Ontario real estate law by expanding the scope of required property disclosures to include latent safety risks beyond the physical condition of the property.
Gilgeous-Alexander's home in Nichols Hills, Oklahoma, was burglarized while he was at the Paycom Center in downtown Oklahoma City, playing the Washington Wizards on October 30, 2025.
