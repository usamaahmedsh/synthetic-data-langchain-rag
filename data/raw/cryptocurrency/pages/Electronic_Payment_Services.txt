== System ==
In each retail location, a terminal is installed and is usually connected to the POS system of the retailer.  The terminal may also be independently connected to banks through the public phone system.
Transactions approved before the cut-off time are batched into a payment made directly to the retailer's account by the end of the business day.

=== ATM card payment ===
EPS entails the simple use of an ATM card or a credit card with ATM capability issued by a member bank of the EPS, acting as a debit card. No application for the service is required.
The EPS device is a dual-unit device consisting of a removable card processor and a stationary base that serves as a charger and data link. Some retailers may use an integrated machine. In such situations, the customer inserts the card into the machine directly and waits for the retailer's acknowledgement before proceeding to the rest of the steps.
