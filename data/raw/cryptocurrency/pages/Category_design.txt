Category design is a business strategy focused on creating and developing new market categories for products or services to establish a company as a leader within that category. Unlike traditional approaches emphasizing competition within existing markets, category design seeks to define and dominate a new niche, often by addressing unmet consumer needs or redefining how a problem is perceived. The concept has been associated with disruptive innovation and is employed by companies seeking to differentiate themselves in competitive industries.


== Concept ==
Category design involves identifying a unique market space, crafting a narrative around it, and building an ecosystem that reinforces the category's identity—products, services, and community support. Proponents argue that successful companies in this approach, sometimes called "category kings," can achieve significant market advantages, including higher valuations and customer loyalty. The strategy extends beyond product development or branding, requiring alignment across a company's culture, business model, and market positioning.
The term gained prominence by associating with entrepreneurial efforts to establish new market categories rather than compete in established ones. It draws on academic research into market dynamics, such as how new product categories emerge and how businesses can influence their development. Critics, however, caution that the approach may oversimplify complex market forces and that success is not guaranteed, as it depends on execution, timing, and broader economic conditions.


== History ==
Category design as a formalized concept emerged in the early 21st century, influenced by business strategies observed in technology startups. Its academic roots trace back to economist Paul Geroski, who, in his 2003 book The Evolution of New Markets, analyzed how market categories evolve from innovation to consolidation. The concept was notably popularized by the 2016 book Play Bigger, authored by Al Ramadan, Dave Peterson, Christopher Lochhead, and Kevin Maney. The book argues that companies dominating a category between six and ten years after its creation, such as through an initial public offering (IPO), tend to capture the majority of market value, based on data from venture capital funded tech firms. It has been linked to companies like DocuSign, Airbnb, and Facebook, which redefined transportation, hospitality, and social networking markets, respectively. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, has been cited as an advocate, applying similar principles to position Salesforce within the cloud computing category.


== Academic context ==

In academia, category design aligns with product and market category evolution studies. Research explores how new categories form—often organically through consumer behavior or technological advances—versus how entrepreneurial efforts can intentionally shape them. Related concepts include "gatekeeping," where influential actors define category boundaries, and "category valorization," where companies legitimize a new market space. The "adjacent possible" concept illustrates why some categories succeed while others falter: innovations like the Wright brothers' airplane, Ford Model T, and Netscape's browser hit this sweet spot, but cryptocurrency struggles with practical utility, as seen in failed ventures like CryptoKitties and Steemit, the latter of which laid off 70 percent of its staff in 2018.

Paul Geroski's work provides a detailed framework for category evolution. In The Evolution of New Markets, he outlined a cycle beginning with an innovation (e.g., ridesharing or smartphones), where a few pioneering firms enter the market. As the innovation gains traction, numerous competitors join, offering varied designs, before a "dominant design" emerges—such as the iPhone in 2007, leading to consolidation and increased market value. Geroski's cycle, based on historical examples like the automobile industry's consolidation around the Ford Model T, suggests that dominant firms are often displaced by new categories, such as smartphones overtaking analog cell phones.


== Recent content ==
Since September 2023, several companies and organizations have published content related to category design, contributing to its discourse in business strategy. These efforts primarily appear in books, articles, and online platforms, often aimed at entrepreneurs and business leaders. Below is a summary of notable contributors with standalone Wikipedia articles, maintaining a neutral and non-promotional tone:

McKinsey & Company: In late 2023, McKinsey published articles exploring how businesses can redefine market categories to gain competitive edges, drawing on case studies from the technology and consumer goods sectors. These pieces emphasize strategic frameworks over explicit endorsement of category design.
Harvard Business Publishing: In 2024, this organization released analyses through Harvard Business Review examining category creation as a growth strategy. The content builds on earlier discussions, integrating recent examples from artificial intelligence and sustainability-focused industries.
Forbes: Forbes has featured columns since mid-2023 discussing category design's relevance to startups and established firms. Contributors have cited examples like Tesla's role in the electric vehicle market, though the articles focus on broad trends rather than specific advocacy.
These publications reflect ongoing interest in category design, though they vary in their depth of engagement with the concept, often framing it within larger strategic discussions.


== Reception ==
Category design has garnered attention in business circles, particularly among startups and venture capitalists, for its potential to drive outsized returns. Supporters highlight its success in cases like Salesforce and Airbnb, where companies established enduring market leadership. However, skepticism exists regarding its universal applicability. Some analysts argue that the strategy's reliance on timing and market readiness limits its predictability, and not all attempts to create new categories succeed—evidenced by numerous failed startups. Additionally, the focus on "category kings" may overlook the role of smaller players who thrive without dominating a market.
As of March 2025, category design remains a topic of debate, with its principles continuing to evolve through practical application and scholarly critique.
