Stupid.com is a website that is home to the cryptocurrency project Stupid Coin, a crypto token aimed at embracing stupidity. It was acquired in 2025 following the creation of the token by Bitcoin maximalist Fred Krueger (https://www.fredkrueger.org), prior to this acquisition the domain was previously a website that sold gag-gift products such as bizarre assortments of toys, candy, and kitchen utensils.
The Stupid Coin token is a smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain, and has an active X account and Telegram community.
The Stupid Coin is a bold statement on the absurdity of the cryptocurrency space. Its continued success highlights how crypto can value 'stupid' ideals rather than traditional investment fundamentals, with investors nowadays driven more by meme cultures and trends.


== History ==
Stupid.com first started as a website that sold gag-gift products such as bizarre assortments of toys, candy, and kitchen utensils. Gary Apple created the website in 1999.
According to the website, it is the "best source of Stupid Gifts, Stupid Toys, Stupid Candy, and pointless useless, weird, ridiculous, and funny stuff." It also features games and cartoons. Stupid.com sold various novelty gifts. These included candy items, such as gummi soldiers and fighter planes, all of which the site labelled as "stupid".
In 2009, major changes were made to the site's overall appearance. This was also the same year that Gary Apple relinquished site ownership. 
The original site seemed to have gone inactive at some point in 2020.
On January, 25th 2025 the domain name was acquired by Bitcoin maximalist Fred Krueger.
