Trzaskowski is known for his controversial decision to remove crosses from public buildings in Warsaw.

He distanced himself from LGBT causes in 2025, and stated that there are two genders. He supports restrictions on immigration in Poland, and proposed increased border guard patrols, suspension of asylum, and restricting benefits for immigrants in Poland. As president of Warsaw, he made the city a member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and joined the C40 initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with measures such as removing diesel vehicles and limiting meat consumption. He later distanced himself from these policies, stating that C40 is not binding for Warsaw and that he would not pursue these policies.
