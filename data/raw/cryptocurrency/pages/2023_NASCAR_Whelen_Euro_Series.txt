The 2023 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series was the fifteenth Racecar Euro Series season, and the eleventh under the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series branding. The season started on 6 May with the Valencia NASCAR Fest at Circuit Ricardo Tormo and ended on 15 October with the EuroNASCAR Finals at Circuit Zolder.
Alon Day and Liam Hezemans did not defend their championship titles in the EuroNASCAR PRO and EuroNASCAR 2 divisions respectively, making it the first season since 2015 where neither of the reigning champion competed in the season that followed. Gianmarco Ercoli, who scored three victories in 2023, secured his first EuroNASCAR PRO championship title after he finished fourth in the final race at Zolder. Ercoli became the first driver to win the championship title in both divisions as he had already previously won the EuroNASCAR 2 title in the aforementioned 2015 season.
The championship battle did see some controversy as SpeedHouse Racing's owner-driver Lucas Lasserre, who entered the final race as the championship leader, had a late collision with Gianmarco's younger brother Mario Ercoli. It was later announced that the collision had no effect on the final standings because Lasserre was hit with a post-race penalty for start procedure infringements. Lasserre managed to finish second regardless with two victories, securing his best championship finish in the NASCAR sanctioned years of EuroNASCAR. Vittorio Ghirelli finished third after scoring two victories, one a piece in Vallelunga and Most. Anthony Kumpen was fourth in his first full-season campaign since 2017 ahead of Hezemans, who won the season opening race at Valencia. Tobias Dauenhauer and Paul Jouffreau took two race wins each, with the latter becoming the youngest race winner in EuroNASCAR PRO at the age of 19.
Jouffreau was also crowned as the EuroNASCAR 2 champion after winning the final race, giving him enough points to overhaul long-time season leader Vladimiros Tziortzis. Jouffreau had three wins compared to Tziortzis' five, but the Frenchman finished every single race inside the top-10 while Tziortzis had three results where he was classified outside of the top-10. Gil Linster finished third after securing his first victory of his career at Zolder. He was followed by Patrick Schober, who also took his first career victory at Oschersleben, and 2021 champion Martin Doubek. Italian YouTuber Alberto Naska scored two victories, but a disastrous final races of the season resulted in him only finishing sixth in the standings.
Hendriks' four-year streak in the Team's Championship was stopped by RDV Competition, who claimed their second Team's title with the No. 3 team of Jouffreau and Frédéric Gabillon. CAAL Racing's No. 54 team, driven by Ercoli and Naska, finished second while Hendriks was third with the No. 50 team of Hezemans and Linster.

=== Calendar changes ===
NASCAR Whelen Euro Series was initially scheduled to be hosting NASCAR's first event on ice with the NASCAR Arctic Ice Race, which was initially scheduled to open the season as an exhibition event on 4–5 March. The announcement follows upon what NASCAR Whelen Euro Series had announced last year where the series plans to host a non-championship Winter Classic event at some point between late 2022 and early 2023. However, on 10 January 2023 it was announced that the race was postponed indefinitely due to global supply chain issues. Had the NASCAR Arctic Ice Race went underway, the race would use the following format that was first announced on 3 December 2022:
Six 30-minute long free practice sessions was planned to be held on Friday on a 3.2 km (2.0 mi) long track.
A Time Attack tournament was planned to be held on a 2.4 km (1.5 mi) track layout on Saturday, with the results of the tournament determined the starting grid for Sunday's event.
A rallycross-style shootout event was planned to be held on Sunday on a 2.0 km (1.2 mi) layout of the track. The shootout would include heat races, semi-finals and finals to determine the overall winner of the event.
NASCAR GP Germany will be returning to the series after a three-year hiatus. The round will be held on Motorsport Arena Oschersleben for the first time and is currently scheduled to fifth round of the season on 23–24 September.
NASCAR GP Belgium regained its former status as the final round of the season. Circuit Zolder is scheduled to host EuroNASCAR's season finale for the first time since 2019 and the sixth time in history, having hosted the final round of the season from 2015 to 2019.
Automotodrom Grobnik loses its status as a championship round and will be scheduled to host an All Star Endurance Race on 11 November. The Endurance Race was later quietly dropped from the schedule, leaving the series with just the six championship rounds.
