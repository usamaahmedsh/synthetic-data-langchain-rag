Xi (  ZY or  (K)SY; uppercase Ξ, lowercase ξ; Greek: ξι) is the fourteenth letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiceless consonant cluster [ks]. Its name is pronounced [ksi] https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/De-Xi.ogg in both Ancient Greek and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 60. Xi was derived from the Phoenician letter samekh .
Xi is distinct from the letter chi, which gave its form to the Latin letter X.


== Greek ==

Both in classical Ancient Greek and in Modern Greek, the letter Ξ represents the consonant cluster /ks/. In some archaic local variants of the Greek alphabet, this letter was missing. Instead, especially in the dialects of most of the Greek mainland and Euboea, the cluster /ks/ was represented by Χ (which in classical Greek is chi, used for /kʰ/).
Because this variant of the Greek alphabet was used in Magna Graecia (the Greek colonies in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian peninsula), the Latin alphabet borrowed Χ rather than Ξ as the Latin letter that represented the /ks/ cluster that was also present in Latin.


== Cyrillic ==
Xi was adopted into the early Cyrillic alphabet as the letter ksi (Ѯ ѯ). It was ultimately removed from the Russian alphabet in 1735.
