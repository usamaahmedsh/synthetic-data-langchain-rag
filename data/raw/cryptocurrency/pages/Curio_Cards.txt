Curio Cards are non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. They were initially created in 2017 to raise money for a group of seven different artists. Renewed interest in NFTs, coinciding with a cryptocurrency bubble, lead to a complete collection of Curio Cards being sold for ETH393 ($1,267,320) at the Christie's Post-War to Present auction in October 2021.


== Background ==
Curio Cards were developed by Travis Uhrig, Thomas Hunt, and Rhett Creighton, and launched on May 9, 2017. At launch, they cost $1 each, which was paid to the artists. Curio Cards feature multiple sets of 30 unique digital images by seven different artists. Curio Cards are colloquially considered to be the first collection of NFT artworks on the Ethereum blockchain. On October 1, 2021, a complete collection of Curio Cards, including the digital misprint "17b", was sold by an anonymous seller for $1.2 million at Christie's Post-War to Present auction held in New York. This was the first Christie's auction where bidding was conducted solely using Ethereum cryptocurrency.
