Tubi (stylized as tubı) is an American over-the-top ad-supported streaming television service owned by Fox Corporation since 2020. The service was launched on April 1, 2014, and is based in San Francisco, California. In 2023, Tubi, Credible Labs, and a few other Fox digital assets were placed into a new division known as the Tubi Media Group.
In May 2024, it was reported to have 80 million monthly active users. In January 2025, Tubi reported to have 97 million monthly active users, and reached 100 million monthly active users in June 2025. The service was ranked 33rd in Fast Company's "The World's 50 Most Innovative Companies of 2025".


== History ==

Tubi was founded by Farhad Massoudi and Thomas Ahn Hicks of AdRise in San Francisco, launching in 2014 as a free service under the name Tubi TV. In May 2017, they raised US$20 million in a round of funding from Jump Capital, Danhua Capital, Cota Capital, and Foundation Capital. In June 2019, Tubi announced that it had over 20 million active monthly users, and later in September, the company reported that users had streamed 132 million hours of content. In September 2020, the company reported 33 million monthly users.
In 2019, Tubi announced it would nearly double its 2018 spending on licensed content, taking it close to US$100 million. In February 2019, Tubi signed a distribution deal with NBCUniversal, which included 400 TV episodes and films.
Tubi became available on Vizio SmartCast on September 25, 2019. On October 21, Tubi launched Tubi Kids, a dedicated hub for the streamer's children-centric content via Roku and supported devices.


=== Sale to Fox ===
On March 17, 2020, Fox Corporation (which had recently been spun off from 21st Century Fox following that company’s acquisition by Disney one year prior) announced that it would acquire Tubi for $440 million cash upfront, with the sale being completed on April 20; Massoudi would remain at the company, which would continue as a separate subsidiary.
In December 2021, Fox acquired MarVista Entertainment, in a move to bolster Tubi's library and leverage its production capabilities for made-for-TV films.
In December 2022, Tubi signed a content deal with South Korean entertainment company CJ ENM, licensing a number of Korean-language films, television series, and K-pop programs. (South Korean content is one of Tubi's fastest-growing categories.)
In January 2023, Tubi signed a content deal with Warner Bros. Discovery for 11 new FAST channels and adding on demand content from various WBD properties.
During Super Bowl LVII, Tubi aired the commercial Interface Interruption. The advertisement tricked its viewers into believing the game had restarted with announcers Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen talking vaguely about the game, before making it appear as though someone had exited the game and changed to Tubi, choosing to watch the 2005 mystery film Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The advertisement, which was purposefully short to alleviate concerns, was met with mixed reactions with some acclaiming the commercial and others such as The Mary Sue and Wanda Sykes referring to it as dangerous.
In July 2023, Anjali Sud was announced as the new CEO of Tubi following the departure of Massoudi.
In December 2023, Tubi signed a new content deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to bring nine new FAST channels and added some of DC Comics shows and films only on demand.
In May 2024, Tubi sued a law firm called Keller Postman for allegedly manufacturing tens of thousands of meritless discrimination claims against it in the hopes of coercing a settlement.
In February 2025, Tubi aired Super Bowl LIX. That same month, Tubi's owner, Fox Corporation, announced it had acquired the podcast and media company, Red Seat Ventures. Red Seat Ventures would still operate as an independent company, but would be placed under Tubi's parent company, Tubi Media Group.
On March 4, 2025, Fox Sports Mexico announced through a statement that it had taken legal action against Fox Corporation (owner of Tubi) and Grupo Pachuca because the alleged right of preference for bidding to continue broadcasting the home matches of Club León and Pachuca in the Liga MX for Mexican territory had not been respected, for which reason the channel asked a judge to order that these games remain without official broadcast on Tubi until the matter is resolved.  However, both Fox Corporation and Grupo Pachuca subsequently responded, clarifying that Grupo Lauman (owner of Fox Sports Mexico) had not paid the corresponding amount for the television rights of both clubs, and therefore the negotiation on behalf of Fox Corp. was legal and that the matches would continue to be streamed on Tubi; in addition, Fox Corp. indicated that the permission that Grupo Lauman had to use the Fox brand had expired and therefore it would have to gradually withdraw it (Fox Sports would later deny this last point).
In October 2025, Tubi announced a partnership with Canadian media company Bell Media, in which it will handle Canadian advertising sales for the service, as well as co-develop new programming for the platform. The agreement expands on an existing development deal between Bell Media and Fox Entertainment.


== Investors and board members ==
Sandy Grushow, former Fox TV chair, is an advisory board member.

== Global availability ==
In November 2015, AdRise partnered with Blue Ant Media to launch Tubi in Canada.
Tubi became inaccessible throughout the European Union as a result of the GDPR entering into force on May 25, 2018. It was later announced that Tubi would relaunch in the United Kingdom by early 2019. According to their website, they "hope to relaunch in the EU in the future". and is "working on compliance [with GDPR] and is planning to relaunch in European countries soon".
Tubi officially launched in Australia and New Zealand (Oceania) on September 1, 2019.
In January 2020, the platform announced an expansion to Mexico, in a partnership with TV Azteca, but became the first Latin American country to launch the service.
In July 2022, Tubi announced a partnership with Shaw Communications to make the service available to all of Shaw's customers, and further expanding Tubi's reach in Canada.
In August 2022, the service launched in Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama.
In July 2024, Tubi launched in the United Kingdom.


== Programming ==
As of January 2023, Tubi's programming includes more than 40,000 films and television series from more than 250 providers (along American and foreign content) on approximately 200 channels. These have included:

Since its acquisition by Fox Corporation, Tubi also carries programming from Fox Entertainment, Fox Soul, local news from stations owned by Fox as well as affiliates of other major networks, and Fox Weather. The service began producing its own original content in 2021, including television films and series. Prior to the Fox acquisition, and still to this day, through the Español and Tubi Kids hubs respectively, the service also inherited former MundoFox game show Minuto para Ganar as well as a few shows that previously aired on Fox's former 4Kids TV block (such as Chaotic (only available in the Spanish-language section), Dinosaur King, G.I. Joe: Sigma 6, and several entries in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise).
Tubi uses a real-time bidding platform for advertisers that deliver video ads across various platforms.
The service has launched a number of special features for users based on their interests and viewing preferences: "Tubi Roulette" offers a random film to watch, while "Tubi Scenes" presents curated clips, helping users decide whether to continue watching the entire movie.
