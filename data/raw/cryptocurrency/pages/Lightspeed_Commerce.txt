== Criticism ==
On September 29 2021, short seller Spruce Point Capital Management publicly accused Lightspeed of exaggerating its finances to investors. The stock fell 11% following the firm's report, closing at $126 a share on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The firm alleged that Lightspeed has covered up "massive inflation" of how many customers it has, how much money it makes from them and how much growth potential it has. Spruce Point argued that the company is massively overvalued and is poised to plummet to as low as $22 a share.
Following Spruce Point's report, Lightspeed released a statement saying, "The report contains numerous important inaccuracies and mischaracterizations which Lightspeed believes are misleading and clearly intended to benefit Spruce Point, which itself has disclosed that it stands to profit in the event that the stock price of Lightspeed declines."
