== Controversies ==


=== Use of WordPress code ===
In October 2016, there was a controversy over Wix's use of WordPress's GPL-licensed code. In response, Avishai Abrahami, Wix's CEO, published a response describing which open-source code was used and how Wix says it collaborates with the open-source community. However, it was subsequently noted that collaboration with the open-source community was not sufficient under the terms of the GPL license, which requires any code built on GPL-licensed code to be released under the same license.


=== Censorship ===
On 31 May 2021, 2021 Hong Kong Charter, a Wix-hosted website run by exiled Hong Kong activists, was shut down at the request of the Hong Kong Police. This was the first known case of Hong Kong's National Security Law being used to censor content on an overseas website. Wix later apologized for "mistakenly removing the website" and reinstated the website after it had been down for four days.
In October 2023, Wix fired an employee in Dublin, Ireland for having made social media posts critical of Israel. This incident led to criticism of Wix from members of the Irish Parliament (Dáil Éireann) and the head of the Irish government, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who said it was "not okay to dismiss somebody because of their political views". Deputy head of government, Tánaiste Micheál Martin also condemned their dismissal, stating "we tolerate debate with freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, and people have different opinions on these issues." The dismissed employee, Courtney Carey, successfully sued the company for unfair dismissal. Wix did not contest the charge, admitting liability.


=== Outreach abroad ===
In October 2023, The Irish Times reported that an Israeli advertising agency advised Wix staff how they can tailor posts for "outreach abroad". This included advice for Wix employees to “show Westernity” in social media posts supporting Israel, stating that “unlike the Gazans, we look and live like Europeans or Americans.”
