== History ==
In 1971, Look magazine built a computer system that, for the first time, stored the names and addresses of their customers on magnetic tape.
Two months later, when Look ceased publication, six employees took this new fulfillment service to Edward Downe, Jr., publisher of Ladies Home Journal and The American Home. He agreed to be their first client, and owner, opening Downe Computer Services April 1, 1972, with 172 employees.
In 1977, the Charter Company in Jacksonville, Florida, bought out Downe Communications’ stock and renamed the company Charter Data Services (CDS).
Hearst Corporation acquired two Charter Company properties in 1982, Redbook and CDS, which they rechristened Communications Data Services and then, in 2007, CDS Global.
The number of magazine titles served increased as CDS Global acquired other fulfillment companies, including Tower Publishing  and Optima  in the U.K. and INDAS in Canada. Electronic payment capabilities were expanded when CDS Global acquired PayDQ in 2011.
