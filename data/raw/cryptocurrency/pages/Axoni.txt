=== Veris ===
In 2020, Axoni launched Veris, a distributed ledger network that manages equity swap transactions. This system is designed for matching and reconciling post-trade data on stock swaps. Companies using this network includes BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Citigroup, Inc. The infrastructure functions as an equity swaps platform, where participating institutions can maintain continual reconciliation of equity swaps until they reach maturity. 
Trading is synchronized for a transaction throughout its lifecycle, and participants can relay changes in real-time. Its first recorded swap involved transactions by Citi and Goldman Sachs. It is also based on the Axcore technology, adding to a suite of enterprise software that provides data management, automation, and development kits (e.g., for distributed application).
