The Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness (CAESAR) is a competition organized by a group of international cryptologic researchers to encourage the design of authenticated encryption schemes. The competition was announced at the Early Symmetric Crypto workshop in January 2013 and the final portfolio in February 2019.


== Use Cases ==
The final CAESAR portfolio is organized into three use cases:

1: Lightweight applications (resource constrained environments)
2: High-performance applications
3: Defense in depth


== Final Portfolio ==
The final portfolio announced by the CAESAR committee is:
