In data processing, operational reporting is reporting about operational details that reflects current activity.  Operational reporting is intended to support the day-to-day activities of the organization. Examples of operational reporting include bank teller end-of-day window balancing reports, daily account audits and adjustments, daily production records, flight-by-flight traveler logs and transaction logs.
Most operational reports do not require time-consuming steps. Most are produced automatically on a regular schedule, or may be available on request.
Operational reporting is intended to provide a granular, real-time, view of the immediate situation. This is distinct from analytical reporting, which is used for longer-term, predictive use-cases.  Operational reporting is repetitive, done frequently, and typically involves numerous simple manual steps.
