Fanfix is a California-based social media technology platform that hosts membership clubs for content creators.


== History and operations ==
Fanfix was founded in December 2020 by college students Harry Gestetner, Simon Pompan and was later joined by Cameron Dallas as cofounder. Fanfix is a membership platform that enables content creators to monetize their followings and connect with their fans.
It allows creators to publish blogs, b-roll videos, tutorials, early access to new releases, post exclusive content and message with their fans for a fee. Fanfix creators include artists, motivational speakers, gamers, TikTokers, models, and fitness influencers. The platform is widely known for its Gen-Z creator base, with many of the top TikTok stars such as Caryn Marjory, Brooke Monk, Anna Shumate, Jumpers Jump, Cameron Dallas and the Mian Twins.
Fanfix is a Patreon-style platform focused on Gen Z. 90% of its referrals come from link-in-bios or swipe-ups from Instagram or Snapchat. Techcrunch reported that as of November 2022, the site had 9.6 million users, including two million monthly active users who had processed hundreds of thousands of transactions, with individual creators earning seven figures on the platform. In 2022, Fanfix announced the launch of SuperLink. In July 2022, it was announced that Fanfix had been acquired by SuperOrdinary, a Los Angeles, California–based brand platform.


== Criticism ==
Fanfix has received criticism over its billing and refund practices. On Trustpilot, several users reported being charged for longer subscription periods than intended, such as annual or multi-month plans, after attempting to sign up for shorter terms. Complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau also describe cases where users said they were billed for extended subscriptions by mistake and were unable to obtain refunds, with some claiming difficulty accessing paid content after purchase.
