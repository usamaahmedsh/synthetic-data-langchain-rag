=== WWE (2022–2023) ===
In March 2022, Lete was one of the 45 college athletes to have attended a three-day WWE tryout during WrestleMania 38 weekend. In August 2022, it was announced that Lete had reported to the WWE Performance Center. She  was assigned to its NXT brand in Orlando, Florida. Performing under the ring name Stella Lilly, she was presented as a larger-than-life social media influencer, blending her real-world digital presence with an exaggerated, glamorous character.
Although she did not have an official in-ring debut, Lilly appeared on NXT programming, including a live in-arena promo where she introduced her persona to the audience. Her character emphasized the spectacle of online fame and influencer culture, drawing on her athletic background and stage presence.
Lete departed WWE's Performance Center in October 2023. She said that a lack of passion for wrestling and concerns about potential injuries—citing that someone in the company told her that getting injured is “part of the job” after she suffered a possible concussion in a live match—led her to plan her exit when she learned she had been released. Lete stated that she was grateful for her time in WWE and added that the company was assisting her in pursuing opportunities on reality television.


== Personal life ==
Lete holds the Guinness World Record for the furthest volleyball set into a basketball hoop. She takes an interest in cryptocurrency, having previously hosted her own now-defunct podcast titled "Crypto Cast".
