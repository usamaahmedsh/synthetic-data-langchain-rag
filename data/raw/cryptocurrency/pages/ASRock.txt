ASRock Inc. (Chinese: 華擎科技股份有限公司; pinyin: Huáqíng Kējì Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī) is a Taiwanese manufacturer of motherboards, industrial PCs and home theater PCs (HTPC).
Established in 2002, it is owned by Pegatron, a company part of the Asus group.


== History ==

ASRock was originally spun off from Asus in 2002 by Ted Hsu (co-founder of the mentioned company), in order to compete with companies like Foxconn for the commodity OEM market. Since then ASRock has also gained momentum in the DIY sector with plans for moving the company upstream beginning in 2007 following a successful IPO on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In 2010 it was acquired by Pegatron, a company part of the Asus group.
As of 2011, ASRock is the world's third largest motherboard manufacturer, having cooperated with professional esports player Johnathan Wendel in the development of a gaming-oriented enthusiast motherboard in 2011.
ASRock established itself as a server motherboard affiliate in April 2013, having received orders from 10 mid-size clients for server and industrial PC motherboards and forming partnerships with system integrators.

Besides motherboards, ASRock also sells desktop mini PCs. Three ASRock products were short-listed for the 2012 Taiwan Brand Award for the first time, and then became endorsed products of the External Trade Development Council when they were promoting the quality image of Taiwan brands globally. In 2012, ASRock stepped into the industrial PC and server motherboard market. ASRock began developing graphics cards in partnership with AMD in 2018 as a result of the surge in cryptocurrency mining.

=== Ryzen 9000 CPU failures on AM5 motherboards ===
As at 26 February 2025, numerous user reports of Ryzen 9000 series CPUs failing prematurely had surfaced on the internet, with the majority of the cases occurring on ASRock motherboards. On 28 May 2025, according to a conversation with YouTuber Tech Yes City, the company acknowledged reports of the CPU failures and attributed it to Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) presets being set "too aggressively" in the motherboard's BIOS, after previously warning of the reports linking the CPU failures to ASRock motherboards as being "misinformation".
On 28 August 2025, ASRock published BIOS update 3.40 for its AM5 motherboards, which claims to address "CPU operating stability". User reports of CPU failures had continued to emerge with previous BIOS updates such as 3.20 and 3.25, which were believed to address several possible causes of the CPU failures.
