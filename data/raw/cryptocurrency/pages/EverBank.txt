In May 2007, EverBank agreed to acquire NetBank's direct banking and small business financing divisions and mortgage servicing portfolio; however, in September 2007, Everbank terminated the agreement, claiming that NetBank had been unable to comply with provisions regarding certain cash levels due to the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis. Instead, EverBank acquired $700 million of NetBank's assets.
In May 2008, MetLife acquired the bank's reverse mortgage division.
In 2009, during the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis, a class action lawsuit was filed against EverBank in the Superior Court of California on behalf of purchasers of certificates of deposit denominated in Icelandic Krona from the bank. The lawsuit alleged that EverBank, against the instructions of its customers, closed the accounts at an unreasonable exchange rate, resulting in a loss of much of the purchasers' principal. Judge Richard Seeborg in San Jose granted EverBank summary judgment on all of the lawsuit's claims, finding that EverBank did not act in bad faith and had the discretion to close the accounts due to exposure of approximately $12 million in losses had the currency not recovered. A federal appeals court remanded the case to district court in 2014 to determine if the bank breached the terms and conditions when it returned the value of the accounts to the class members. The case was settled in 2016.
