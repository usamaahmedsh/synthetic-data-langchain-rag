The Legion of Boom allowed the fewest passing yards in the league and the Seahawks had the top ranked defense in 2013.

The Seahawks reached the NFC Championship after defeating the New Orleans Saints 23–15 in the NFC Divisional Round. On January 19, 2014, Sherman made two combined tackles and a pass deflection as the Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 49ers 23–17 in the NFC Championship Game. He played a critical role and deflected a pass by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, that was intended for Michael Crabtree, which was caught by teammate Malcolm Smith to seal the Seahawks' 23–17 victory.
The play was later dubbed "the Immaculate Deflection" (as an homage to the Immaculate Reception), and would later be voted by Seahawks fans to be the most significant play in franchise history. After the play, Sherman ran over to Crabtree and offered a handshake with Crabtree responding by shoving Sherman in his facemask. Sherman proceeded to make a choke sign towards Kaepernick and was immediately penalized by the officials for unsportsmanlike conduct. The NFL went on to fine Sherman $7,875 for his taunting directed towards Kaepernick.

"Well, I'm the best corner in the game! When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you gonna get! Don't you ever talk about me! Don't you open your mouth about the best, or y'know I'm gonna shut it for you real quick! L.O.B.!"

Sherman's rant was the subject of scrutiny by fans and the media, some of whom deemed him a "thug". He later blamed Crabtree's shove for fueling his post-game rant, though he also said he regretted his attack and was dismayed by the negative response from the public. In response to the word "thug" being widely used to criticize Sherman following the incident, Sherman said "The reason it bothers me is because it seems like it's an accepted way of calling somebody the N-word now."
On February 2, 2014, Sherman started in Super Bowl XLVIII, recording three combined tackles and a pass deflection. He left the game with a high ankle sprain and spent majority of the fourth quarter on the sidelines with a walking boot and crutches in Seattle’s dominant 43–8 victory over Denver Broncos, the league's best offense.
