The following is a list of gig economy companies. The list includes only companies that have been noted by sources as being former or current gig economy companies.


== Background ==
The Congressional Research Service defines the "gig economy" as: the collection of markets that match providers to consumers on a gig (or job) basis in support of on-demand commerce. In the basic model, gig workers enter into formal agreements with on-demand companies to provide services to company's clients. Prospective clients request services through an Internet-based technological platform or smartphone application that allows them to search for providers or to specify jobs. Providers (gig workers) engaged by the on-demand company provide the requested service and are compensated for the jobs.
In 2019, Queensland University of Technology published a report stating 7% of Australians participate in the gig economy. 10% of the American workforce participated in the gig economy in 2018. According to a 2019 Bank of Canada report, 18% of Canadians worked in the gig economy for non-recreational reasons. Around 2018, 15% of China's workforce, representing over 110 million people, was involved in the gig economy. In 2019, the World Bank estimated that globally, fewer than 0.5% of people in the "active labor force" take part in the gig economy.
