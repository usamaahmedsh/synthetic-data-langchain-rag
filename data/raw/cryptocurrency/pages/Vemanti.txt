== History ==


=== Early years and VoiceStep ===
Vemanti was founded by CEO Tan Tran as a holding company structure. Prior to Vemanti's incorporation, Tran had co-founded VoiceStep Telecom LLC with Mark Vehberg on January 27, 2005, in California. VoiceStep was established to provide Voice over IP telecommunications services, primarily serving smaller and prepaid long-distance carriers and international calling card providers.
Vemanti was incorporated on April 3, 2014, under Nevada law to serve as a holding company for VoiceStep and future acquisitions. The company subsequently acquired VoiceStep as a wholly-owned subsidiary.


=== Expansion into financial technology ===
The company expanded its business focus to include financial technology investments. In 2018, Vemanti made strategic investments including a 20% ownership stake in Fvndit (formerly Directus Holdings, Inc.), a Nevada-based fintech company that operates peer-to-peer financing platforms for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam.
Vemanti also invested $25,000 in Chopp, Inc., a Delaware-registered online logistics company operating as a same-day e-grocery delivery service.
In September 2025, Vemanti Group was announced as one of the strategic partners in the DNEX digital asset exchange project, a 10,000 billion VND (approximately $400 million USD) initiative led by HVA Group in Da Nang, Vietnam. The project aims to establish digital asset trading infrastructure to serve the issuance, custody, and trading of tokenized assets, aligning with Vietnam's pilot cryptocurrency market regulations.


=== PVComBank partnership ===
In August 2021, Vemanti signed a Fintech and Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) Memorandum of Understanding with Vietnam Public Joint Stock Commercial Bank (PVcomBank) to jointly develop financial products and banking solutions for underserved consumers and small businesses in Vietnam.
The partnership progressed with a Letter of Intent signed in January 2022, followed by an official 10-year agreement finalized in March 2022. The initiative was designed to create one of the first SME-focused digital banking (neobanking) platforms in Vietnam, utilizing cloud computing, API, automated KYC/AML, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technologies.
Under the agreement, the Vemanti-branded digital banking platform was designed to allow customers to sign up for accounts and access services entirely online while maintaining the option to visit physical PVcomBank branches. PVcomBank, which was ranked "The Best Digital Bank in Vietnam" in 2021, operates over 100 transaction offices across major Vietnamese provinces.


=== ONUS Pro acquisition ===
In January 2025, Vemanti announced a significant strategic shift with the signing of a Share Purchase Agreement to acquire a majority controlling stake in XPLOR Technology Pte. Ltd., the Singapore-based parent company of ONUS Pro, a cryptocurrency exchange platform.
The acquisition was completed in March 2025, giving Vemanti a 51% controlling interest in ONUS Pro. As part of the transaction, Eric Vuong from XPLOR was appointed as Chairman of Vemanti's board of directors.
In July 2025, Vemanti announced plans to acquire the remaining 49% equity interest in XPLOR Technology, which would bring its ownership of ONUS Pro to 100%.


== Business operations ==


=== VoiceStep Telecom ===
VoiceStep Telecom LLC is Vemanti's wholly-owned subsidiary that provides VoIP telecommunications services to small and medium-sized businesses in the United States. The company offers cloud-based, multi-location, enterprise-grade communications solutions including voice, text, web conferencing, and fax services across various devices.
VoiceStep's services include PBX features such as multiple extensions, call control, Outlook integration, SMS, web conferencing, fax capabilities, auto-receptionist, call logs, and rule-based call routing.


=== ONUS Pro cryptocurrency exchange ===
Through its acquisition of XPLOR Technology, Vemanti operates ONUS Pro, a cryptocurrency exchange platform serving primarily the Vietnamese market. According to company statements, ONUS Pro serves over 4.5 million users in Vietnam and processes daily trading volumes ranging from $200 million to $300 million.
The platform features an advanced matching engine capable of processing up to 50,000 transactions per second with sub-second latency, and provides access to over 600 digital assets.


=== Digital banking services ===
Through its partnership with PVcomBank, Vemanti operates digital banking services targeting SMEs in Vietnam. The Vemanti-branded neobanking platform integrates with PVcomBank's core banking system and regulatory framework to provide fully digital financial services. The platform was designed to serve Vietnam's significant SME sector, which accounts for over 41% of the country's GDP according to company statements.
The digital banking solution utilizes cloud computing, APIs, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technologies to provide streamlined banking services without requiring customers to visit physical branches, though PVcomBank's network of over 100 offices remains available for in-person support.


=== Other investments ===
Vemanti holds minority investments in several companies:

Fvndit: A 20% stake in the Nevada-based fintech company that operates peer-to-peer financing platforms for SMEs in Vietnam through its subsidiary eLoan JSC
VinHMS Pte Ltd: Previously acquired as a wholly-owned subsidiary specializing in hospitality management technology, but the acquisition was mutually rescinded in December 2024 as part of Vemanti's strategic refocus on FinTech and digital assets


== Financial performance and outlook ==
According to company statements, Vemanti projects 2025 revenues to exceed $30 million with net profit margins of 10% to 12%, representing targeted year-over-year growth of 50%.
The company has historically generated revenue from its VoiceStep telecommunications business since 2014, though it has reported net losses in recent years due to increased competition from free telecommunications applications and investments in new technology initiatives.


== Future plans ==


=== NASDAQ uplisting ===
Vemanti has announced plans to uplist from the OTC Markets to NASDAQ, with the company stating that the ONUS Pro acquisition is intended to strengthen its financial foundation for this transition. The company is working with investment banks on Form S-1 filing and selecting a PCAOB-registered auditor as part of this process.


=== Stablecoin development ===
Vemanti has announced plans to develop USDV, a USD-backed stablecoin designed for cross-border transactions, particularly between the United States and Southeast Asian markets. The stablecoin initiative is being developed under regulatory frameworks including the GENIUS Act. Following the company's strategic refocus in December 2024, the stablecoin initiative was reintroduced as part of its renewed emphasis on cryptocurrencies and digital assets.
