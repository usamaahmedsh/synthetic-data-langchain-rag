Fairmat is a free-of-charge multi-platform software that allows to model financial contracts (e.g. a derivative contract) or projects with many contingencies (e.g. a Real Options model) by decomposing it into basic parts. Complex structures and dependencies are modelled using a graphical interface. Virtually any pay-off function and asset class( from interest rate derivatives to equity-linked notes) can be described using a simple algebraic language.
Fairmat is available for Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Ubuntu[1].


== Features ==
Fairmat provides a high level abstraction and allows users to price and perform analysis for new derivative contracts or project by modelling it with a bottom-up procedure, with no knowledge of programming languages. The generated models can then be solved by using Monte Carlo simulation, binomial trees or closed form procedures (e.g. the black model).
The information about the structure of every project model is contained in an xml file and can be exchanged with third parties.
Fairmat capabilities can be extended and specialized by plug-ins using the Mono.addins extensibility model. Available plug-ins can be found on [2] Archived 2012-06-16 at the Wayback Machine, and while few of the plug-ins are closed source software, many of them are open source and their development can be followed on the Fairmat github page.
