Dmitry Khovratovich is a Russian cryptographer, currently a Lead Cryptographer for the Dusk Network, researcher for the Ethereum Foundation, and member of the International Association for Cryptologic Research.


== Biography ==
Khovratovich, together with Alex Biryukov, developed the Equihash proof-of-work algorithm which is currently being used as consensus mechanism for the Zcash cryptocurrency, and the Argon2 key derivation function, which won the Password Hashing Competition in July 2015.
He is the publisher of several cryptanalysis papers for a number of mainstream cyphers, such as the first cryptanalytic attack on full-round AES-192 and AES-256 which is faster than a brute-force attack, an attack on the RadioGatún cryptographic primitive, and also the current best cryptanalysis on Skein, a candidate for the SHA-3 competition.
In 2014, he published a research about the deanonymisation of clients in the Bitcoin P2P network
