Global Finance & Technology Network (GFTN) (formerly Elevandi) is created by Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to serve expanding Singapore's fintech ecosystem globally.
GFTN will focus on four business lines – organising fintech festivals, providing advisory and research services, providing digital platform services to SMEs, and establishing a fund for investing on technology related start-ups.
Ravi Menon, former managing director of the MAS is appointed as the chairman of GFTN.
Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA), was appointed in July 2025 as Chair of the International Advisory Board of GFTN.
