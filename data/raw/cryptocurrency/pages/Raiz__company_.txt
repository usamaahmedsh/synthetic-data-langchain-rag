Raiz Invest Limited (ASX:RZI) is an Australian fintech company that operates one of the country’s most-downloaded micro-investing and spare-change investing apps.  Through automated “round-ups”, recurring deposits and lump-sum transfers, the mobile platform invests customer funds into diversified portfolios of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) alongside options for Bitcoin, Australian residential property and themed equity baskets.  Raiz positions itself as a low-cost digital robo-advisor and wealth-management provider, extending its offering to superannuation via the Raiz Invest Super product.
Since launch in 2016, the service has grown a predominantly millennial user base: about 70 % are aged 18–35 and more than four-fifths add money to their account at least once a month.  Investments can start from as little as AU$5, and the app holds average ratings of 4.8/5 on the Apple App Store and 4.5/5 on Google Play from over 50,000 combined reviews.  As at 24 November 2024 Raiz managed **AU$1.59 billion** for **315,634 active customers**, up 31.8 % year-on-year, and reported FY 2024 Australian revenue of **AU$21 million** with positive EBITDA of **AU$1.3 million**.
The company originated as Acorns Australia under licence from Acorns Grow (United States), re-branded to Raiz and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2018.  After brief expansion to Indonesia and Malaysia, Raiz divested both Asian subsidiaries in FY 2024–FY 2025 to refocus on domestic growth and profitability.  Its product suite has since diversified to include **Raiz Plus** (custom portfolios), **Raiz Kids** (custodial accounts), **Raiz Rewards** (cashback investing), **Raiz Jars** (goal-based saving) and an unlisted Residential Property Fund.
Raiz’s approach to “democratising investing” has been recognised with multiple industry awards, including *Investment Innovator of the Year* at the FinTech Business Awards (2017–2019), *Best FinTech App* at the FinTech Australia Awards (2023) and *Innovation Excellence* from Canstar (2025).
