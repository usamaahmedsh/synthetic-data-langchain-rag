In October 2016, the company removed the BUX app from app stores for Belgium just 1 month after launch, due to local law prohibiting the commercialization of leveraged CFDs.
In January 2017, the app was launched in Italy. In October 2017, the firm raised another €10,600,000 from two existing shareholders, Holtzbrinck Ventures and Velocity Capital Management, as well as from a number of private investors (such as Arthur Kosten, the former CMO of Booking.com, BinckBank founder Thierry Schaap and the CEO and founder of Mollie nl:Adriaan Mol).

In September 2019, a new app named BUX Zero, was launched in the Netherlands. In June 2020, it was launched in Germany and Austria and one month later in France. In August 2020, it became available in Belgium.

The Financial Times and Handelsblatt reported that German neobank N26 wanted to acquire BUX for €200 million, but the deal collapsed after N26 pushed for new conditions and a lower price.
