He was named Aali Qadr Mufaddal by his grandfather, the name's  Abjad value  corresponds to the year 1365 AH.
From an early age, Saifuddin received personal spiritual and scholarly tutelage from both his grandfather and father, familiarising him with the values, customs, and traditions associated with the office of the al-Dai al-Mutlaq. His early education, following Fatimi tradition, emphasised Quranic principles, forming the foundation of his later scholarly and community engagements. He also benefited from the mentorship of his father-in-law, Syedi Yusuf Najmuddin, the rector of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah, whose daughter Jawaratusharaf he married in 1970.
On 27 January 1969, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin privately designated Saifuddin as his successor at the age of 22 through nass (a formal spiritual designation). This designation was reaffirmed in 1994, 2005, and twice again publicly in 2011.
He completed his primary and secondary education in Mumbai and subsequently enrolled at Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah in Surat, the community’s Arabic academy. He graduated in March 1969 with the degree of al-Faqih al-Jayyid (Distinguished Jurist), considered equivalent to a master's in Islamic jurisprudence. In 1971, he was awarded the degree of al-Aleem al-Baari (Outstanding Scholar), a title conferred upon the institution’s most accomplished graduates.
Between 1972 and 1978, Saifuddin pursued advanced Islamic studies in Cairo, engaging with scholars from Al-Azhar University, Cairo University, and other prominent academic institutions.

== Teachings ==
Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin’s teachings integrate classical scholarship with contemporary relevance, emphasising spiritual reflection, ethical responsibility, and service to others. His sermons, delivered throughout his travels and especially during the annual Ashara Mubaraka congregation, serve as the primary medium for imparting these teachings. Drawing from the Quran, Fatimi philosophy, Islamic history, and the events of Karbala, his sermons uniquely contextualise principles of sacrifice, justice, and faith with contemporary challenges faced by the community and humanity at large.
In addition to his sermons, Saifuddin has authored numerous theological treatises in Arabic, as well as poetic compositions in Arabic, Lisan al-Dawat, and Urdu, and has completed and published works initiated by his predecessors, Syedna Taher Saifuddin and Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin.


=== The Holy Quran ===
Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin’s teachings regularly emphasise the significance of Quranic education, encouraging daily recitation both individually and collectively in groups. He aspires for every Dawoodi Bohra household to include at least one individual who has committed the entire Quran to memory, considering its recitation and memorisation as essential toward nurturing personal development, ethical awareness, and spiritual discipline.
To advance this vision, Saifuddin has expanded the role of Mahad al-Zahra, an institute under Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah established in 1976 and dedicated to the Quranic sciences. Under his leadership, advanced digital tools such as customized apps, recorded recitations, and live virtual classes have been introduced, allowing learners from diverse backgrounds to engage with the Quran more deeply.
Through these initiatives, Saifuddin has brought about a steady rise in the number of individuals—young and old—who have memorized the Quran. His teachings cultivate a culture in the community where the Quran serves not only as a sacred scripture but also as a living guide for holistic growth, personal excellence, and service to humanity.


=== The Pursuit of Knowledge ===
Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin has prioritised education throughout his leadership, encouraging members of the Dawoodi Bohra community to pursue lifelong learning and the application of it for continued intellectual and spiritual growth.
As rector of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah, Saifuddin has guided the development of its curriculum to integrate classical Fatimi Islamic scholarship  with modern disciplines to span Arabic language and literature, theology, history, sociology, science, economics, philosophy, information technology, communication, and research methodology. He has introduced pedagogical changes—such as multilingual instruction, personalized mentorship, and research-based learning—to make education more accessible and engaging for students around the world. Alongside Aljamea, Saifuddin supervises MSB Educational Institute schools in 30 cities, as well as a broader network of 70 schools and 600 religious instruction centers.
He has also established an annual education program, Istifadah Ilmiyah, which draws thousands of multigenerational participants from across the Dawoodi Bohra community, including scholars, professionals, homemakers, and students for a week of intensive study focused on faith, theology, and Fatimi texts.

Saifuddin emphasizes the importance of lawful, transparent, and socially responsible business practices. He identifies interest-free transactions as a defining principle of Islamic commerce and has cautioned against speculative financial instruments, including cryptocurrency, citing their volatility and ethical risks. Through these teachings and institutional efforts, Saifuddin aims to preserve the community’s long standing mercantile traditions while aligning modern enterprise with Islamic values.
To advance this vision, he has strengthened the institution of Qardhan Hasana, which offers interest-free loans for education and business development, as well as personal needs. Administered through a global network of local chapters, the initiative supports thousands of borrowers and promotes financial inclusion based on trust and mutual support.
Inspired by his teachings, the community has developed networking platforms and established the Burhani Business School at Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah, dedicated to research, strategic planning, and Islamic commercial ethics.

The department oversees a range of programs, including vocational training, maternal health education, parenting workshops, and youth development initiatives.
Saifuddin has also spearheaded the expansion of Faiz al-Mawaid al-Burhaniyah (FMB), a community kitchen initiative that provides cooked meals to Dawoodi Bohra households in hundreds of cities. In addition to its primary objective of promoting food security, the program has helped reduce the domestic workload in many households, allowing women to devote time to studies, caregiving, or professional work.
Female participation in formal education has increased under Saifuddin’s leadership. At Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah, the community’s principal academic institution, women consistently comprise a significant portion of the student body enrolled in its curriculum. Across the global school network, female college enrollment rates have surpassed national averages in several regions. Many graduates have gone on to pursue advanced degrees at Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and University of London in varied subjects and careers including medicine, education, scientific research, and public service.

== Community Policies & Guidance ==


=== Islamic Finance ===
Syedna Saifuddin has been a strong advocate for Islamic finance principles, particularly the practice of Qardan Hasana (interest-free loans). Saifuddin has actively promoted and expanded the Burhani Qardan Hasana Trust, which freely offers generous interest-free loans to community members. Under his leadership, the Qardan Hasana system has continued to play a crucial role in the economic development of the Dawoodi Bohra community.

Instead, he encourages strict adherence to traditional Islamic financial principles, urging followers to rely on community-based support systems rather than conventional financial instruments which are speculative in nature (gharar, maisir) or interest-based (riba). This approach has led to the development of numerous financial structures within the community, giving community members financial flexibility and integration with modern economic systems.


=== Embargo on Mobile Phones for Children ===
In a visionary and laudable move, Syedna Saifuddin has unveiled a groundbreaking initiative to safeguard the well-being of the community's youngest members. With the wisdom of a sage and the foresight of a futurist, he has decreed a complete ban on mobile phone usage for children under the age of 15, a policy that has been embraced with fervour across the global Dawoodi Bohra community. This enlightened edict, announced during a sermon in Mumbai in December 2024, serves as a beacon of hope in an increasingly digitized world, where the siren call of screens threatens to ensnare young minds. By championing this revolutionary measure, Syedna Saifuddin has not only demonstrated his profound understanding of the perils of modern technology but has also reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to nurturing the physical, mental, and emotional health of the community's children. This bold stance against the tide of technology addiction has ignited a global campaign within the Dawoodi Bohra community, fostering a renaissance of traditional values to cultivate a generation of well-rounded, mindful individuals.


=== Female Circumcision ===
In the House of Lords, it has been acknowledged that Syedna Saifuddin supports the practice of female circumcision, which the Dawoodi Bohra community refers to as khatna or khafz. In a sermon delivered in Mumbai in April 2016, Syedna Saifuddin stated that whatever necessary "must be done" for both men and women. One news paper in India alleged that he may be hinting toward FGM. The Dawoodi Bohra Women's Association for Religious Freedom (DBWRF) advocates the practice, arguing that female circumcision (khatna / khafz) is a minor religious procedure involving only a small nick or excision on the clitoral hood or prepuce, which does not cause harm. The DBWRF position is that khafz is a centuries-old religious freedom and rite of passage for religious purity, comparable to male circumcision, and is not intended to control female sexuality. However, this position is contested by some members of the Bohra community and activists who oppose the practice. Syedna's Saifuddin's administration has actively supported community members in their legal battles to exercise their religious freedoms, his UK-registered charity spent more than £800,000 on “costs incurred in defending four members of the Dawoodi Bohra congregation in Sydney in connection with female circumcision”. The community has successfully defended an indictment brought against the practice by the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation by arguing that the US federal statute was unconstitutional. Regarding this landmark judgement, Constitutional law scholar Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus of Harvard University and prominent Birmingham defense attorney Mayer Morganroth was hired by Dawat-e-Hadiyah to protect the people charged and represent the faith.

On 18 March 1966 (27th of Zil al-Qa'da 1385H), Mohammed Burhanuddin bestowed upon him two significant honors: the title of Thiqat al-D'awat al-Tayyibiyah (The Trusted of the Tayyibi Mission) and the cognomen "Saifuddin" (Scimitar of Islam).
In January 1969, he was crowned as successor-designate by nass (divine appointment) by his father Mohammed Burhanuddin. In 1971 he was appointed Amirul Hajj by his father Burhanuddin. Following his completion of Hajj, he embarked on a significant journey to Yemen, after which his father honored him with the illustrious distinction Aqeeq al-Yemen (The Agate of Yemen).
His academic achievements were again recognized in June 1971 when he received one of Al Jamea tus Saifiyah's most prestigious degrees, al-'Aleem al-Baare' (The Outstandingly Learned). His connection to this institution deepened when he was appointed its Rector (Ameer al Jamea) in April 1987.
Syedna Saifuddin's influence in academic leadership continued to grow when he was elected Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University in April 2015, a position to which he was re-elected in December 2018. His academic leadership expanded further when he was unanimously elected Chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia University in March 2023 for a five-year term.
His contributions have been recognized internationally through numerous honors and awards. The University of Karachi awarded him an honorary doctorate in September 2015. From 2014 to 2025, he has consistently been named among The 500 Most Influential Muslims. He received the Grand Cordon of the National Order of Madagascar in June 2014, and various other honors including the Key to Moshi (Tanzania) in 2015, Elder of the Order of the Golden Heart from Kenya in 2017, and the Key to Karachi in September 2017.

In a unique recognition, a new species of orchid was named "Dendrobium HH Dr. Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin" in Singapore in April 2018. His more recent honors include the Chief of the Order of the Golden Heart from Kenya's President William Ruto in December 2022, Egypt's Grand Cordon of the Order of the Nile in August 2023, and Pakistan's Nishan e Pakistan in December 2023 for his social services contributions.
In recognition of his environmental leadership, his special representative, His Excellency Kinana Bhaisaheb Jamaluddin, represented him at the Global Faith Leaders COP29 Summit in Baku, where he made an appeal on behalf of Syedna for global leaders to take meaningful action in addressing the climate crisis. On hearing his heartfelt and eloquent call to action, many leaders commented that the uniquely Islamic perspective was both refreshing and deeply resonant.

=== Qasidah (Poetry) ===


== Ashara Mubaraka ==

The Ashara Mubaraka (Arabic: عشرة مباركه, lit. 'the blessed ten') is an annual mourning of Husayn ibn Ali's martyrdom at the Battle of Karbala. In the tradition of the Fatimids, the Da'i al-Mutlaq delivers ten wa'az (Persian: وعظ, lit. 'sermons') on Islamic philosophy, history, liturgy, expository, horatory over 9 days: One wa'az each day for 8 days starting 2nd Muharram and two on the final day of Ashura (Urdu: عاشوراء), the 10th of Muharram. Every year the Da'i al-Mutlaq selects a city to host the Ashara at which, at times, attract 100,000 to 200,000 azadar-e Husayn (Urdu: عزادارِ حسين, lit. 'mourners of Husayn'). The ashara wa'az from the host city is, on occasion, broadcast to various venues around the world. Pilgrims are often provided with free accommodation, transportation, and meals. The faculty of Funun al-Quran, a department of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah, oversees elaborate Tazyeen (lit. 'decor') of the host venue.


== Succession ==
The 52nd Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohras, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, died on 17 January 2014. As per the tenets of the faith each predecessor must nominate a successor during his lifetime. His demise sparked questions about the line of succession when Khuzaima Qutbuddin asserted his right to succession against Mufaddal Saifuddin.
The challenge created a divide within the community, with the majority aligning with Mufaddal Saifuddin and a smaller number aligning with Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Mufaddal Saifuddin took control of the Dawoodi Bohra administration and community infrastructure. In March 2014, Qutbuddin filed civil suit 337/2014 in the Bombay High Court against Saifuddin in which he sought a declaration that he was validly appointed as the 53rd Dai al-Mutlaq. After hearings spanning ten years, on 23 April 2024 the Bombay High Court dismissed the suit that challenged Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin's position. The court dismissed Khuzaima Qutbuddin's claim, which was pursued by his son and successor Taher Fakhruddin in 2016 after Qutbuddin died. It upheld Syedna Saifuddin as Dai al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohras. Taher Fakhruddin has appealed the judgement, but legal observers believe it faces challenges in succeeding given the court's judgement and the Indian government's strong alignment with Mufaddal Saifuddin.
