== History ==
The company was founded in Little Rock in 1968 as Systematics, which was later acquired by ALLTEL Information Services as its Financial Services division.

== Mergers, acquisitions and divestments ==
Throughout its history, FIS has made many acquisitions. Its largest, a proposed merger with Global Payments, was reported as being worth US$70 billion of combined enterprise value. Discussions about the merger were halted in December 2020.

=== Divestments ===
In February 2023, in the wake of pressure from activist investors, the company announced it would spin off its merchant business that consisted of Worldpay in the next 12 months. In July 2023, FIS agreed to sell a 55 percent stake in Worldpay to private equity firm GTCR for $11.7 billion, valuing WorldPay at $18.5 billion. On February 1, 2024, the company announced it had competed the sale of a majority stake in its Worldpay Merchant Solutions business to GTCR in a transaction that valued the deal at US$18.5 billion, including US$1 billion contingent on returns realized by GTCR. FIS will maintain commercial agreements with Worldpay and will create a joint strategic go-to-market partnership between the two entities.


== Finances ==
FIS has experienced fluctuating revenue and profitability in recent years, influenced by acquisitions, divestitures, and restructuring efforts, most notably around its Worldpay business. After a decline in 2022, the company stabilised its performance in 2023 and returned to growth in 2024.
In 2024, FIS reported $14.51 billion in revenue, an increase from $14.50 billion in 2023. Operating income grew significantly to $3.55 billion, and net income reached $1.94 billion, reflecting improved margin performance following the spin-off of Worldpay. As of Q1 2025, the company reported strong quarterly results with a 3% year-over-year revenue increase and an adjusted EPS of $1.21. It expects to return over $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2025 through share repurchases and dividends.


== Controversies ==
On July 3, 2007, Certegy Check Services, part of FIS, announced that a worker at one of its subsidiaries stole 2.3 million consumer records containing credit card, bank account, and other personal information. This estimate was later increased to 8.5 million consumer records. The next month, a law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against CCS and parent company FIS based on the privacy breach; the firm claims that, since CCS provides check-verification services to many major U.S. stores, "consumers do not choose to use the services of these companies but rather are forced to do so".
In August 2011, Florida based eFunds Prepaid Solutions, part of FIS, was the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack that saw hackers steal $13 million from ATMs using 22 stolen prepaid cards belonging to a single client of FIS.
On January 16-17, 2025, FIS reported a power outage causing technical issues at a large number of banks, including Capital One.  Depositors report not being able to access online or mobile banking or not having accurate current data.
