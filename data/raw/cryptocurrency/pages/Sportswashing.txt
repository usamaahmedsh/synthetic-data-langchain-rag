Sportswashing is a term used to describe the practice of governments, individuals, corporations, or other groups using sports to improve reputations tarnished by wrongdoing. A form of propaganda, sportswashing can be accomplished through hosting sporting events, purchasing or sponsoring sporting teams, or participating in a sport.
At the international level, it is believed that sportswashing has been used to direct attention away from poor human rights records and corruption scandals. At the individual and corporate levels, it is believed that sportswashing has been used to cover up vices, crimes, and scandals. Sportswashing is an example of reputation laundering.


== Overview ==
Internationally, sportswashing has been described as part of a country's soft power. The first usage of the term "sportswashing" may have been applied to Azerbaijan and its hosting of the 2015 European Games in Baku.

Gulf states accused of sportswashing have been the most vocal in attempting to dismiss these claims, often arguing that they simply want to enjoy sporting events in their home countries or attract new investments. These accused parties often say that sporting boycotts and event relocation are both unfair to sporting fans and are ineffective in changing government policy. In the case of Formula One, the league has even argued that "the sport is better able to effect change by visiting these countries and holding them to commitments they have made that are legally binding." The 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia has been cited as an example of a government's attempt to tackle the country's negative global reputation, which was low due to the Kremlin's aggressive foreign policy, with the sporting event attempting to redirect the international community's attention away from Russia's crimes and atrocities in Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine to the success of the World Cup.
Companies accused of sportswashing include Ineos's sponsorship of professional cycling's Team Sky (now the Ineos Grenadiers) in 2019, and Arabtec's sponsorship of Manchester City F.C.
A key characteristic of sportswashing is the very costly efforts parties must undertake as it is not just about getting the rights to an event but building the infrastructure to hold these games. For example, leading up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup the host country Qatar, the smallest country to ever host the World Cup, invested around $220 billion into luxury accommodations, expanded transport networks, and stadiums to prepare. In March 2021, human rights organization Grant Liberty said that Saudi Arabia alone has spent at least $1.5 billion on its own alleged sportswashing activities.

=== Association football ===
Domestic teams:

Italian media proprietor and politician Silvio Berlusconi, through his Fininvest holding, owned Serie A club A.C. Milan in 1986 and had 98% of the club's share until 2017. Berlusconi gained popularity in the country by leveraging his team's success, strongly supported by his own mass media, including Mediaset, to improve public opinion, which was useful for his political purposes. Berlusconi founded Forza Italia, a centre-right party, and in 1994 became Prime Minister of Italy. During more than two decades of government, divided into four periods, he was involved in abuse of office, bribery, corruption of public personnel, and false accounting cases, as well as sex scandals, among other controversies surrounding Berlusconi. He proposed and approved many ad personam laws (a type of clientelism) in favour of his own business, including the Milanese club as the Lentini affair in 1995, the Decreto Salva Calcio in 2003, which allowed Milan to be relieved its debt of € 242 million, and the decriminalisation of false accounting during the second Berlusconi government, a charge for which his club and local rival FC Internazionale Milano were tried and acquitted five years later due that measure; obtaining political support from the Milan fanbase, one of the largest in the country. In 2018, after he sold Milan to Chinese businessman Li Yonghong, Berlusconi, through Fininvest, owned AC Monza, a club that then competed in the national Serie C, with 100% of the club's shares.

Russian politician and businessman Roman Abramovich's ownership of Chelsea F.C. (2003–2022), which some have reported was done at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin

Kazakhstan joined UEFA in 2002 and has also sponsored numerous sporting events in recent years. Kazakhstan has been historically and sometimes still accused of being an authoritarian dictatorship  due to its repression on dissidents and censorship of media, and that their UEFA membership association has also been under criticism as Kazakhstan has shared more commons with the authoritarian AFC than with more democratic UEFA due to the majority of Asian nations being authoritarian as contrast to European ones, which has gained headline after Kazakhstan become the first UEFA member after Belarus to send a national team (U-21) to play Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, FC Astana, a football project launched by the autocratic government of Nursultan Nazarbayev to gain a foothold in Europe and justify its change of membership, was also seen as sportswashing.

In February 2024, the NBA also signed a multiyear global marketing partnership with the airline Emirates, making the airline an inaugural title partner of the NBA Cup. Emirates also became the NBA's first-ever referee jersey patch partner. The league was questioned over the type of countries it was picking for alliance, including the UAE. The deals between the NBA and the UAE were criticized, citing the Emirates’ involvement in the Sudan civil war and its constant arms supply to the Rapid Support Force militia. Human Rights Watch stated that the UAE conducts high-profile sporting and other events in an attempt to portray an image of openness, while practicing a zero-tolerance policy.
