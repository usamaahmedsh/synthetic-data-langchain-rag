In 2007 Sage purchased a part ownership stake in A-League football club Perth Glory, and fully took over the club in 2009 after buying out co-owner Brett McKeon.

The deal fell apart after the founder of LFE was revealed to be using a fake identity, and was actually convicted fraudster James Abbass Biniaz.
Sage stepped down as owner of the club in 2023. The club was issued a breach notice & Sage was stripped of the license due to financial turmoil that included requiring loans from the central administration of the league to pay staff & player wages.
