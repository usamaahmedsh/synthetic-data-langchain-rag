Waon (ワオン) is a Japanese electronic money system introduced by ÆON in April 2007. It is a rechargeable contactless smart card. Like many other smart card systems in Japan, it uses RFID technology developed by Sony known as FeliCa. Its name comes from waon (和音), meaning chord. The card's official mascot is a white dog. The card reader makes a "waon" sound upon successful transaction, a Japanese onomatopoeia for dog barks.
Unlike the nanaco card issued by Seven & I Holdings, the basic Waon card can be purchased without any registrations. Like other FeliCa-based systems, Waon has a mobile payment system, known as Mobile Waon.
