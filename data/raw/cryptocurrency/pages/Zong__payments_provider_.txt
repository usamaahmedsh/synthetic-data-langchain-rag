Zong was a mobile payment company that allowed users to make micropayments on the Internet if they have a postpaid mobile phone. The payments were charged to their mobile phone bills by the mobile operator. The company was acquired by eBay in 2011 and disappeared in 2015.
Zong payments were only accepted by online games and social networks, and the service can be used to purchase virtual goods[]. Zong was awarded the 2009 Frost & Sullivan Best Practices Award for New Product Innovation in the Mobile Payments category. In May 2015, Zong disappeared from the web without any public declaration. The website now simply redirects to PayPal.

On March 12, 2009, Zong announced to stop short messaging services and target its mobile payment system.
