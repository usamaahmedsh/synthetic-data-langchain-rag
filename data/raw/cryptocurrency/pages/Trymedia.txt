== Overview ==
Trymedia was founded in 1999 as Trymedia Systems, Inc. by cousins Alex Torrubia and Andres Torrubia. The company was launched in Spain, and after a round of fund-raising in New York, relocated to San Francisco. Macrovision acquired Trymedia for US$34 million on July 26, 2005. With the acquisition, Macrovision launched a new games division, Trymedia Games Division, based around Trymedia employees. Trymedia was not a profitable operation, losing $14.5 million on revenue of just over $9 million in 2007. On February 22, 2008, RealNetworks announced it had acquired Trymedia from Macrovision for an undisclosed sum, reported in a Macrovision conference call to be $4million.
