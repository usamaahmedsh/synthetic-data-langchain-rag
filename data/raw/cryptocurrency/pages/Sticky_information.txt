In the field of management, sticky information is information that is costly to acquire, transfer, and use in a new location. Eric von Hippel coined the term around 1994. Because of the importance of sticky, local information for some kinds of innovation and product customization, von Hippel suggests that in certain circumstances the innovation will be increasingly accomplished by end-users (user innovation) rather than an expert provider. Toolkits for user innovation can be used to support end-users in their innovation process.
