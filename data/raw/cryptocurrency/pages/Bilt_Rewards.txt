In 2023, Wells Fargo and Bilt Rewards renegotiated their partnership program as a result of financial losses.
In August 2024, Bilt Rewards was valued at $3.25 billion after investment from Ontario Teachers Pension Plan.
In March 2025, Bilt Rewards acquired Banyan, a fintech company providing item-level receipt data infrastructure.
In April 2025, Bilt partnered with American Campus Communities (ACC), a student housing provider, offering rewards on monthly campus housing payments.
In July 2025, Wells Fargo announced that it sought to end its partnership with Bilt Rewards ahead of schedule, as Wells Fargo was losing as much as $10 million per month through Bilt Rewards.
