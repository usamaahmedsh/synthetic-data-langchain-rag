=== Kolena ===
While an undergraduate, Rashwan built Kolena (meaning "all of us" in Arabic), an online interactive town-hall using Facebook Connect that was used by tens of thousands of Egyptians during the Egyptian revolution. In an interview, Rashwan envisioned Kolena serving as “Egypt’s online interactive Town lady Meeting…a place for people to go to submit and vote on ideas for change."


=== Ribbon ===

Ribbon was a payments startup that let users sell online using a shortened URL that can be shared across email, social media and a seller's own website. The service focuses on bringing integrated checkouts directly to platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter letting buyers purchase without leaving those services. Ribbon has been featured in publications including Techcrunch, Wall Street Journal, Entrepreneur, The Next Web, and ArsTechnica.
After the company announced support for "in-stream" payments on Twitter, allowing buyers to purchase items without leaving the Twitter.com stream, Twitter shut down Ribbon's API access after approximately an hour and a half.


=== Payout.com ===
Founded in late 2014, Payout provides online lenders with a payouts, disbursements and compliance API that is used by top online lenders such as LendUp and Prosper. Lenders are able to push money to consumers' credit cards in real-time. The company moved more than $50 million in loans by its second year. Payout went through the AngelPad accelerator and subsequently raised $4.75 million, led by Tim Draper of Draper Associates.
In 2017, he was named to the 2017 Forbes 30 Under 30 list in the Enterprise Technology for Payout.

Rashwan met Ophelia Snyder in 2011 in San Francisco, where they discovered bitcoin. In 2018, they founded 21.co (formerly Amun), which aims to build bridges into the cryptocurrency world. Its subsidiary 21Shares AG launched the first physically backed cryptocurrency Exchange-traded product (ETP) called HODL in November 2018 on the SIX Swiss Exchange.
