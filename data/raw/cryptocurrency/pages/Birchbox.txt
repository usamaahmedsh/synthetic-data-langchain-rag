Birchbox is a New York City-based online monthly subscription service that sends its subscribers a box of four to five selected samples of makeup or other beauty-related products. The products include skincare items, perfumes, organic-based products, and various other cosmetics.
Since 2023, it has been owned by Retention Brands.


== History ==
Birchbox was established in September 2010 by Katia Beauchamp and Hayley Barna, both graduates of Harvard Business School.  In October 2010, Birchbox's initial funding began with $1.4 million in seed funding from investors including First Round and Accel Partners.
In August 2011, Birchbox received $10.5 million in Series A Funding. In April 2014, it raised $60 million in Series B funding, led by Viking Global Investors, and saw participation from First Round Capital, Accel Partners, Aspect Partners, and Consigliere Brand Capital.
In July 2014, the company opened its first brick-and-mortar store in New York's Soho neighborhood. As of 2014, Birchbox  was valued at $485 million. In October, it partnered with Soldsie to launch its first Instagram shop. The shop allows Instagram users interested in Birchbox products to purchase directly through Instagram by leaving a comment on a photo with the hashtag #birchboxcart.
In 2015, Barna stepped down from the co-CEO role at the company and joined the First Round Capital firm as a venture partner. In January 2016, the company cut 15% of its staff.
Five months after raising $90 million, it had a minority stake acquired in October 2018 by Walgreens, whose stores began offering its service. However, Birchbox cut 70% of its staff of 230 employees in January 2020. 
After being purchased by start-up FemTec for $45 million in October 2021, the online subscription service was acquired in 2023 by Retention Brands.


== Business ==
As of Jan 2021, Birchbox has 300 thousand subscribers and 500 thousand active customers. Birchbox's incentive is that the consumer will choose to purchase the full-sized product of whatever sample they've grown to like from the Birchbox website afterward. As of 2021, about 5% of box subscribers went on to make full-size purchases.
After subscribing, the customer takes a "beauty profile" survey that aims to customize their future selections to suit their preferences better.
