Benchmarking requires the use of specific valuation methods. With evaluation it means the level of achieving the target for a particular evaluation item. There are general "methods", approaches as well as IT-supported "software tools" that respectively enable an effective and efficient work.
The following is a list of notable methods and benchmarking software tools.


== Benchmarking methods ==
There are many benchmarking methods each having different analytical focus. The methods are mostly known and will be shown in the following summary.


== Benchmarking software tools ==

There are a number software tools that allow the support of different kinds of benchmarking types.


== Benchmarking HPC Clusters ==
There are numerous suites for examining the performance of a High Performance Computing cluster, including

ADEPT – 4 suites relating to energy measurements
HPCC, HPCG, Linpack
IMB (Intel MPI Benchmark) – gives rates for common MPI-1 point-to-point and collectives
Mantevo – series of "mini apps" from Sandia National Labs (SNL)
NAS and NPB
SHOC – for accelerators
Stream (memory b/w)
