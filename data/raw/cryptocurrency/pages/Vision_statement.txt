A vision statement is a high-level, inspirational statement of an idealistic emotional future of a company or group. Vision describes the basic human emotion that a founder intends to be experienced by the people the organization interacts with.
Vision statements may fill the following functions for a company:

Serve as foundations for a broader strategic plan.
Motivate existing employees and attract potential employees by clearly categorizing the company's goals and attracting like-minded individuals.
Focus company efforts and facilitate the creation of core competencies by directing the company to only focus on strategic opportunities that advance the company's vision.
Help companies differentiate from competitors.
