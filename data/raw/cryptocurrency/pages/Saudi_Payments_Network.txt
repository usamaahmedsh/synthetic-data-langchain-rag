The Saudi Payments Network (Arabic: الشبكة السعودية للمدفوعات), commonly known as Mada (Arabic: مدى, literally "range" or  "extent" ; formerly SPAN), is the primary payment system in Saudi Arabia. Established by the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA), the network connects all automated teller machines (ATMs) and point-of-sale (POS) terminals across the Kingdom to a central payment switch that routes transactions to the appropriate card issuer.


== Overview ==
All banks operating in Saudi Arabia are mandated by SAMA to issue ATM cards that are fully compatible with the network. Customers benefit from free service regardless of the ATM used, its operator, or the card issuer. Mada operates through a vast infrastructure comprising more than 17,000 ATMs and over 225,000 POS terminals within the country. In partnership with global payment systems such as Visa, MasterCard, and Maestro, the network also enables access to millions of ATMs and POS terminals worldwide.
Mada was originally launched as SPAN and later upgraded to SPAN2. This newer version complies with EMV standards and incorporates a higher-capacity infrastructure that reduces transaction processing times—particularly at POS terminals—thereby addressing limitations of the first-generation system.


== Network Statistics ==
As of the latest available data, Mada has achieved significant milestones:

1.7 million POS devices in operation across Saudi Arabia.
8.9 billion transactions processed through the network.
613.9 billion SAR in transaction value.
8.6 billion NFC transactions, demonstrating a strong shift towards contactless payments.
575.6 billion SAR in NFC transaction value.
47.7 million Mada cards issued to customer


== Services and Features ==
Mada supports electronic payments through multiple channels:

Point-of-Sale (POS) Terminals: Facilitates face-to-face transactions.
Soft POS: Allows payment acceptance via mobile devices.
Automated Teller Machines (ATMs): Enables cash withdrawals and other banking functions.

The Mada network exclusively issues only debit and prepaid cards, which are always co-branded [Mandatory] with GCC NET and  either Visa or MasterCard to ensure international acceptance.
Mada offers two primary payment services:

Atheer: An NFC (near-field communication) payment service that enables contactless transactions using Mada cards.
