PayPak (Urdu: پے پاک) is a domestic payment service available in Pakistan. 
It was launched in 2016 by 1Link to save inter-change costs of International Payment Schemes. PayPak cards can only be used on ATMs, POS terminals, and e-commerce portals within Pakistan.
The new payment scheme aims to compete in the domestic market with other, established, international payment schemes such as Visa, Mastercard, and UnionPay.


== Technology and license ==
PayPak uses Gemalto's product PURE. PURE is an off-the-shelf payment application from Gemalto that is fully compliant with the EMV standard. It is designed for banks and private payment card associations seeking chip-based security and a fast time to market. Additionally, PURE is a scheme-agnostic EMV application that private-label card issuers and national payment associations can utilise without the need to enter into a business agreement with another payment scheme.


== Market share ==
The uptake of the payment scheme was initially slow, with State Bank of Pakistan intervening to encourage adoption. By February 2021, more than 4 million PayPak cards had been issued – representing about 9% of the overall 44.5 million payment cards issued in the country. By January 2024, this number rose to 11 million cardholders, giving PayPak a market share of 25% in the country's debit card segment and 19% among the overall 57 million payment cards issued.
