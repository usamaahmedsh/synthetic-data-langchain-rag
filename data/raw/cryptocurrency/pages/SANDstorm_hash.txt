The SANDstorm hash is a cryptographic hash function designed in 2008 by Mark Torgerson, Richard Schroeppel, Tim Draelos, Nathan Dautenhahn, Sean Malone, Andrea Walker, Michael Collins, and Hilarie Orman for the NIST SHA-3 competition.
The SANDstorm hash was accepted into the first round of the NIST hash function competition, but was not accepted into the second round.


== Architecture ==
The hash function has an explicit key schedule. It uses an 8-bit by 8-bit S-box. The hash function can be parallelized on a large range of platforms using multi-core processing.
Both SANDstorm-256 and SANDstorm-512 run more than twice as slowly as SHA-2 as measured by cpb.
As of 2009, no collision attack or preimage attack against SANDstorm is known which is better than the trivial birthday attack or long second preimage attack.
