Longform was an American media company founded in Brooklyn, New York City, in April 2010 by journalists Max Linsky and Aaron Lammer. It operated a longform article recommendation service until January 2022, and hosted an interview podcast with journalists talking about their craft until June 2024.


== Podcast ==
The Longform Podcast, hosted by Linsky and Lammer, along with Evan Ratliff, was launched in 2012 in a makeshift studio at the offices of The Atavist Magazine. It consisted of interviews with journalists talking about their craft. Its 585 episodes were published weekly, with the hosts alternating. Each episode interviewed one journalist, sometimes discussing a single story they'd written and other times their entire oeuvre. It joined the Vox Media Podcast Network in August 2021. It published its last episode in June 2024, at which time The New York Times wrote that it had become "required listening for aspiring and early-career writers who were eager to learn about how the people they looked up to — from veterans of legacy publications to bloggers at new media start-ups — made it to where they were." Owen Lewis, writing for Defector, praised Linsky's "knack for asking unflinching and unexpected questions in a style that comes off as more curious than intrusive".  Nicholas Quah wrote for Vulture, "What Longform has created is a historical record of American nonfiction that's so monumental it should really be housed at a university somewhere." He asked various journalists for their favorite episodes, which included one where Linsky interviewed writer Sam Fragoso while accidentally high on edibles.
