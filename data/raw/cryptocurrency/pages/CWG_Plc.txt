== History ==
Founded in 1992 by visionary entrepreneur Austin Okere, CWG Plc began as a distributor of computer equipment and technical support. The company expanded into telecommunications in 1994 with the formation of DCC Networks, and, in 1997, acquired Expert Edge Technologies, enhancing its software capacity.
Regional expansion began in 2003 with CWG Ghana, followed by offices in Uganda (2010) and Cameroon (2012). CWG went public on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 2013, raising ₦14 billion to fuel further expansion.
A major pivot took place with the launch of “CWG 2.0,” a strategic plan to shift from hardware sales to digital platforms, software, and managed services. The innovation hub, FifthLab, was launched in 2022 to accelerate software product development. In 2023, CWG opened its UAE office in Dubai and began expanding into Kenya and Rwanda.
