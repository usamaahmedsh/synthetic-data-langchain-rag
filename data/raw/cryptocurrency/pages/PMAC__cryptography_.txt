PMAC, which stands for parallelizable MAC, is a message authentication code algorithm.  It was created by Phillip Rogaway.
PMAC is a method of taking a block cipher and creating an efficient message authentication code that is reducible in security to the underlying block cipher.
PMAC is similar in functionality to the OMAC algorithm.
