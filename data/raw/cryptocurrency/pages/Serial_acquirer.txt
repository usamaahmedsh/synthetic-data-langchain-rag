A serial acquirer is a company that pursues a strategy of growth mainly through repeated mergers and acquisitions rather than relying solely on organic growth. This approach is often associated with long-term "buy-and-build" or "roll-up" strategies, where numerous acquisitions are integrated into a larger operating platform.


== Characteristics ==
Serial acquirers typically share several features:

A decentralized operating model allowing acquired firms to retain autonomy.
Disciplined capital allocation, with acquisitions funded through reinvested cash flow.
A focus on acquiring smaller companies in fragmented industries.


== Notable examples ==

Several publicly traded companies are frequently cited as examples of successful serial acquirers:

Constellation Software
Berkshire Hathaway
Danaher Corporation
TransDigm Group


== Criticism and risks ==
While serial acquisition strategies can generate significant growth, critics highlight risks including:

Integration challenges across multiple acquired businesses
Potential overpayment or misallocation of capital
Reliance on favorable credit markets to finance acquisitions
