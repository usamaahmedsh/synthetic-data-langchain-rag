== Security issues ==
In 2015, Kaseya fixed a directory traversal vulnerability in their remote access tool. The same bug was present in the company's support website for a further six years.
In 2018, the company's remote tool was infiltrated and hackers were able to commandeer affected computers to mine cryptocurrency.
In July 2021, a supply chain ransomware attack on VSA software, perpetrated by REvil, affected Kayesa's customers. Kayesa reported downtime for under 60 customers and fewer than 1,500 downstream businesses.


== Business practices ==
Kaseya faced backlash in 2022, with customers unhappy with the company’s end user license agreement (EULA), which had been in effect since November 2020. The EULA auto-renewed contracts for “additional Terms equal to the greater of the expiring Term length or three (3) years.” In response to customer feedback, Kaseya modified the EULA so that all contracts subject to automatic renewal renewed for the same duration as the prior agreement. Kaseya also gave customers the ability to cancel an agreement any time up to 30 days before its expiration. Additionally, Kaseya implemented a policy to send multiple renewal notifications 90 days in advance.
