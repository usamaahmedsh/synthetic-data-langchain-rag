This is a list of episodes for The Daily Show, a late-night talk and satirical news television program airing on Comedy Central, during 2023. This was the first year since the departure of host Trevor Noah, who took his leave from the show after 7 years on December 8, 2022.
With no successor for Noah in place, Comedy Central indicated in December 2022 that a series of guests hosts will fill the anchor chair, each sitting in for a one-week assignment, until a permanent host(s) takes over. Leslie Jones would be the first guest host the week of January 17–19, with Wanda Sykes, D. L. Hughley, Chelsea Handler, and Sarah Silverman confirmed for subsequent weeks. Al Franken, John Leguizamo, Marlon Wayans, Kal Penn, and Hasan Minhaj would also serve as guest hosts in February and March.  In April, Daily Show correspondents Roy Wood, Jr., Jordan Klepper, and Desi Lydic would have their own turns as hosts.
The Daily Show's guest setup was scheduled to continue into at least June, but after Dulcé Sloan's first night as guest host on May 1, the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike prompted the show to go dark. After the strike ended on September 27, Comedy Central announced that The Daily Show would return on October 16, with correspondent Michael Kosta hosting the first week back. Subsequent hosts through the end of 2023 included Sarah Silverman, Leslie Jones, and Kal Penn, who each had turns as hosts earlier in the year; first-time hosts Desus Nice, Michelle Wolf, and Charlamagne tha God, who had scheduled guest turns in the spring that were scuttled due to the strike; and a "News Team Takeover" that saw the show's correspondents split host duties during the week of Thanksgiving. The network has indicated plans for a permanent new host to take over the anchor desk in 2024.
