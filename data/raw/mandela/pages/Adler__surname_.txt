Adler is a surname of German origin meaning eagle. and has a frequency in the United Kingdom of less than 0.004%, and of 0.008% in the United States.
In Christian iconography, the eagle is the symbol of John the Evangelist, and as such a stylized eagle was commonly used as a house sign/totem in German-speaking areas. From the tenement the term easily moved to its inhabitants, particularly to those having only one name. This phenomenon can be easily seen in German and Austrian censuses from the 16th and 17th centuries.
