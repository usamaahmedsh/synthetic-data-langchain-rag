Abreu is a Galician-Portuguese surname. 
The source of the name is debated. The family name has a Portuguese form, and has been explained as being an ancient branch of the house of Normandy via the Countship of Évreux, France. It has also been linked to the name Abraham (Portuguese Abraão), the Biblical figure. Some argue that it is an abbreviation of the Portuguese phrase "Abraham the Hebrew" (Portuguese Abraão O Hebreu).
