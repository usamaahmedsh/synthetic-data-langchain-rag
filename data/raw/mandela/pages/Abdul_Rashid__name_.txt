ʻAbd al-Rashīd (ALA-LC romanization of Arabic: عبد الرشيد) is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ʻabd and al-Rashīd, one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names. It means "servant of the right-minded".
Because the letter r is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Rashid, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Rashid. Alternative transliterations include ‘Abd ar-Rasheed and others, all subject to variable spacing and hyphenation. 
It should not be confused with ʻAbd al-Rāshid (Arabic: عبد الراشد).
