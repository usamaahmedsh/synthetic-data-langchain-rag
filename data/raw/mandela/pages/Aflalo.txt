Aflalo is a Sephardi Jewish surname historically originating in the Jewish communities of Morocco and Algeria, and predominantly occurring today in countries with large North African Jewish migrant communities, such as Israel, France, and Canada. The surname is probably relative to the Arabic word aflal, which means desert, or may be derived from the name of a Berber village Afelilou in the Central Atlas or the Tafilalet province in southeast Morocco.
Notable people with the surname include:

Eli Aflalo (born 1952), Israeli politician
Kobi Aflalo (born 1976), Israeli pop singer
Raphael Aflalo (born 1996), Brazilian footballer
Valerie Aflalo (born 1976), Swedish model, beauty pageant winner, and fashion designer
