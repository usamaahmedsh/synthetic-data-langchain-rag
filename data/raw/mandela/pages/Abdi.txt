== Arabic name ==
While Arabic speakers commonly use Abdu (عبده‎ / عبدو ʿabdu) rather than Abdi, both are nicknames for Abdul. It originates from the Arabic word عبد ال ʿabd al- / ʿabd el- / ʿabd ul-. The name translates as "servant of God" in reference to religious submission to Allah (God). As such, it is often used by Muslims around the world in conjunction with one of the names of God in Islam, but also sometimes on its own.


== Biblical name ==
Abdi is the name of three men in the Hebrew Bible. In Hebrew, Abdi (עַבְדִּ֖י) literally means "my servant", but may be an abbreviation for "servant of "Yahweh".
