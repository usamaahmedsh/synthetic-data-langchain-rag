ʻAbd al-Rabb (ALA-LC romanization of Arabic: عبد الرب) is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ʻabd and al-Rabb. The name means "servant of the Lord", a Muslim theophoric name.
Because the letter r is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Rab, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Rab. Alternative transliterations include ‘Abd ar-Rabb, Abdul Rab, and others, all subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.
