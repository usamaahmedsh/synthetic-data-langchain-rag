Adel is a given name of ancient European origins that evolved from words meaning "noble", "nobility" or "elite".
It is derived primarily from the languages of north-western Europe, which include English, French, Luxembourgish, German, Dutch, Frisian, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Faroese, and Icelandic. Today, "Adel" is a gender-neutral given name and short form of given names with this combining element.
Nordic variants of the name include Ådel, Ädel, Ádel, and Ædel. German and Dutch variants of the name include Adal and Edel. French variants of the name include Édel and Adél (not to be confused with Adèle). Adelson and Adelaide are notable masculine and feminine forms. Adelle (Adèle) is a popular feminine alternative.
Although global, Adel remains prominent in north-western European countries. It can also be found as a family name with or without an affix (such as de Adel, den Adel, or van Adel).
The earliest known woman with the name was Princess Adel of Liège (born c. 632 AD). The earliest known man with the name was King Adel of Sweden (born c. 572 AD). His son's name was Adelson The legendary king of the Frisians and founder of the kingdom, Friso, had a son named Adel (later king of Frisia), supposedly born in the 3rd century BC.
Adel is an exemplar of a monothematic name. It is also the root of the names Adelais, Aderic, Adolf, Albert, and Alice, and their variants in other languages.
It is not related to the Arabic name Adil, also spelled Adel, which derives from the root 'ādil, meaning just or equitable.

Today, "adel" is used throughout much of north-western Europe as the word for nobility.
