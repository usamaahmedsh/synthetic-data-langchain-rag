Adnan (Arabic: عدنان, ʿAdnān) is a masculine name common in Europe and the Middle East. Its eponymous bearer was Adnan, an ancient ancestor of various Semitic tribes. The etymological meaning of the name is settler, from a Semitic root `dn; "to stay, abide", which is derived from the word "Eden" from multiple ancient languages, reflecting its rich etymological history. The literal meaning of the name is "Two Gardens of Eden" in Arabic and Aramaic.


== Etymological connection ==
The Akkadian edinnu is closely related to an Aramaic root word meaning "fruitful" or "well-watered," underscoring the concept of Eden as a place of fertility and divine abundance. The Akkadian word edinnu (𒂔𒄘𒃻, meaning "plain" or "steppe") and the Sumerian word edin (𒂔𒁴, meaning "plain, open country") are believed to be the etymological roots of the Hebrew word "Eden."


== Biblical origins ==
The name "Eden" is most famously known as the name of the garden where God placed Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis.
In the context of the Bible, the concept of "two gardens of Eden" can be understood through the lens of the Garden of Eden as a physical place and the concept of a "higher Gan Eden" as a celestial, spiritual realm, rather than two distinct physical gardens.
The Bible mentions other gardens, such as the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus was arrested before his crucifixion. Some Christian theologians interpret Gethsemane as a symbolic parallel to the Garden of Eden, representing a spiritual restoration of what was lost in the first garden.


== Jewish origins ==
The Hebrew word for Eden, עֵדֶן (ʿĒḏen), translates to "delight" or "paradise," signifying a place of divine pleasure and abundance.
The Garden of Eden (Hebrew: גַּן עֵדֶן, Gan Eden) is the earthly paradise described in the Book of Genesis, where Adam and Eve resided before their expulsion following the Fall. It is portrayed as a lush, well-watered garden containing the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
In Jewish eschatology, the "higher Gan Eden" (Garden of Righteousness) is considered a celestial, spiritual realm where the souls of the righteous, both Jewish and non-Jewish, dwell after death. This concept is part of the broader Jewish understanding of the afterlife, where the righteous enjoy divine proximity and eternal peace.
Jewish rabbinical tradition distinguishes between the physical Gan (garden) and the celestial Eden. According to this interpretation, Adam resided only in the Gan, while Eden itself remains unseen by mortal eyes. This interpretation emphasizes a spiritual Eden, beyond human perception, reserved for the righteous.
