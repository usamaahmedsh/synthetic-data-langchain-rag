Abramson is a variation of a patronymic surname, meaning "son of Abram (or Abraham)", the Biblical figure. Surnames like "Abramson" became particularly important in Jewish communities due to the pressures of assimilation and identification. In medieval Europe, Jewish families were often required by authorities to adopt fixed surnames for taxation and census purposes. This was especially true in the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the 18th century under Emperor Joseph II, who mandated the adoption of Germanic surnames by Jewish citizens.  
It is most prevalent among American Jews. When Jewish families emigrated to English-speaking countries, especially during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many adapted their surnames to conform to English spelling and pronunciation norms. "Abramson" became a natural Anglicized form, retaining its original meaning while adapting to English grammar.
