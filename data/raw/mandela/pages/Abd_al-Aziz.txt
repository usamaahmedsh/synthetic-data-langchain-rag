Abd al-Aziz (Arabic: عبد العزيز, DMG: ʽAbd al-ʽAzīz), frequently also transliterated Abdul-Aziz, is a male Arabic Muslim given name and, in modern usage, surname. It is built from the words ʽAbd, the Arabic definite article and ʽAzīz "Almighty". The name is commonly abbreviated as "ʽAzīz". The name means "servant of the Almighty", al-ʽAzīz being one of the names of God in Islam, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.
The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. So the first part can appear as Abdel, without spacing and hyphenation. Abdelaziz (with an e) is the most common transliteration of the name in the Maghreb.
