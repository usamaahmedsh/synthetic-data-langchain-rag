This list of monastic houses in Scotland is a catalogue of the abbeys, priories, friaries and other monastic religious houses of Scotland.
In this article alien houses are included, as are smaller establishments such as cells and notable monastic granges (particularly those with resident monks). The numerous monastic hospitals per se are not included here unless at some time the foundation had, or was purported to have, the status or function of an abbey, priory, friary or preceptory/commandery.
The geographical co-ordinates provided are sourced from details provided by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments in Scotland (RCAHMS) and Ordnance Survey publications.
