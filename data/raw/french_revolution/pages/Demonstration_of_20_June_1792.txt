The Demonstration of 20 June 1792 (French: Journée du 20 juin 1792) was the last bloodless attempt made by the revolutionaries of Paris to persuade King Louis XVI of France to abandon his current policy and adopt a more compliant role in the escalating frenzy of the French Revolution.  The demonstrators' stated aims were to persuade the king to enforce the Legislative Assembly's rulings, defend France against foreign invasion, and conform to the French Constitution of 1791. In particular, the demonstrators hoped that the king would withdraw his veto and recall the Girondin ministers.
The Demonstration was the last phase of the unsuccessful attempt to establish a constitutional monarchy in France.  After the Insurrection of 10 August 1792, the monarchy was deposed. Soon after, Louis XVI was beheaded by guillotine.
