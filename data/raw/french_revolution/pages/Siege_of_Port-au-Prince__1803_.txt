In October, 22,000 men of the rebel Indigenous Army under General Jean-Jacques Dessalines laid siege to the city of Port-au-Prince. After a month of siege and several attacks, the defending French garrison under Jean-Pierre Marie Lavalette du Verdier evacuated the city and retreated to Cap-Français.
