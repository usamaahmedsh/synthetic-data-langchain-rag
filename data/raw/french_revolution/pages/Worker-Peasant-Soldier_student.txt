Worker-Peasant-Soldier students (Chinese: 工农兵学员; pinyin: Gōngnóngbīng xuéyuán) were Chinese students who entered colleges between 1970 and 1976, during the later part of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). They were accepted not for their academic qualifications, but rather for their work experience as workers, peasants, or soldiers favored by the Chinese Communist Party as part of the "Five Red Categories" and enjoyed affirmative action during the Cultural Revolution. No one was admitted directly from high school without any previous work experience. 
In 1977, after Chairman Mao Zedong's death, the Worker-Peasant-Soldier program ended when Deng Xiaoping reinstated the National Higher Education Entrance Examination, where high school graduates were once again allowed to enter colleges without having to work first.
