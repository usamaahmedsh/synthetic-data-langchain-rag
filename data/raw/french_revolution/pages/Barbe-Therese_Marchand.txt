Barbe-Therese Marchand (1745 -fl. 1792), was a French journalist and editor. She was the director and chief editor of the Affiches d'Artois of Arras in 1789–1792.
Her newspaper became known for its opposition against the Jacobins, and she came to be in conflict with Maximilien Robespierre and Charlotte Robespierre. She discontinued her paper and left the country in 1792 in fear of political persecution.
