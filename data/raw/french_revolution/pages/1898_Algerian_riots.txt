The 1898 Algerian riots were a series of violent and antisemitic attacks or pogroms against the Jewish community in Algeria, French North Africa, that occurred from January 18 to 24, 1898. The riots were sparked by the release of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French officer who had been falsely convicted of treason. Riots occurred in Algiers, Mostaganem, Si-Mustapha, Boufarik, and Blida. Over 700 people were convicted and received prison terms for the riots.
