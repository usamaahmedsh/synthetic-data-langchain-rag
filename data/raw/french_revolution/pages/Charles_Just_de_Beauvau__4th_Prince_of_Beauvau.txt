Charles Just François-Victurnien de Beauvau-Craon, 4th Prince of Beauvau (7 March 1793 – 14 March 1864) was a 19th-century French senator and army officer. Though also Prince of Craon he was better known as the Prince of Beauvau.


== Early life ==
Charles was born on 7 March 1793 at Sunninghill in Berkshire, while his parents were in exile in England from the French Revolution. He was the son of Marc Étienne Gabriel, de Beauvau, chamberlain of Emperor Napoleon I, and Nathalie Henriette Victurnienne de Rochechouart, a lady of the palace of the Empress Marie-Louise. Among his siblings was Edmond-Henry-Étienne-Victurnien de Beauvau, prince de Craon.
His paternal grandparents were Ferdinand-Jérôme de Beauvau-Craon, Prince of Craon, Marquis of Haroué, and the former Louise Desmier d'Archiac (a daughter of General Étienne-Louis Desmier d'Archiac and granddaughter of Jean-Henri d'Anthès). His maternal grandparents were Victurnien-Jean-Baptiste Marie de Rochechouart, 9th Duke of Mortemart, and of the former Anne Catherine Gabrielle d'Harcourt.


== Career ==
After the family returned to France, he entered the French army in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars, becoming an officer of carabiniers, two years later, during the campaign against Russia. The Prince was seriously wounded in the Battle of Winkovo, leading to his retirement from the service.
In 1827 he acquired the Château de Sainte-Assise and used his fortune to restore the estate, which had been divided up during the French Revolution. In 1852, Prince Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte named him senator, serving until his death in 1864. He was also elected Councillor-General of the Meurthe in 1854.
