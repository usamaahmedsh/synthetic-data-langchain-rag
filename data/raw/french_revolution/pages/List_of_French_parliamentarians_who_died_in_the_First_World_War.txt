The German Empire declared war on the French Republic on 3 August 1914, and France thus participated for four years in the First World War, on the Allied side and against the Central Powers. Some 1,400,000 French men, including colonial soldiers, were killed in the war during the conflict.
The political regime in France was that of the Third Republic, and Raymond Poincaré (Democratic Republican Alliance) was elected President of the Republic in 1913, indirectly by the National Assembly. Legislative elections were held in April and May 1914, producing the center-left coalition government led by Prime Minister René Viviani (Republican-Socialist Party). On 26 August, due to the war, René Viviani took over the leadership of a new government, the Sacred Union, in which all parties participated.
Enlisted in the armed forces or as civilians, sixteen members of the Chamber of Deputies and one senator were killed in the war and recognized as having died for their country. In addition, two senators died after being held hostage by German forces. The following is the list of them:
