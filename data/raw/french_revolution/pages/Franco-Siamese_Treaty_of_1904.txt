The Franco–Siamese Treaty of 1904 (Thai: สนธิสัญญาสยาม–ฝรั่งเศส ร.ศ. 122) was a convention between the Kingdom of Siam during the reign of King Chulalongkorn and France during the presidency of President Émile Loubet. It sets out the demarcation of the boundary between the Kingdom of Siam and neighboring territories which had been colonized by France, as well as granting extraterritorial rights to French citizens.
