The Battle of Tirurangadi (also called the Battle of Calicut) was a series of engagements that took place between 7 and 12 December 1790 at Tirurangadi near the port of Calicut on the Malabar Coast of India, during the Third Anglo-Mysore War.
A British Bombay Army force landed at Tellicherry and with the aid of sepoys and horses provided by Travancore, defeated Tipu's commander, Hussain Ali Khan, at Calicut.  Abercromby then went on to capture "all of Malabar."
