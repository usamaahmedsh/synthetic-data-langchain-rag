The Sazonov–Paléologue Agreement was a 26 April 1916 letter from Russian Foreign minister Sergey Sazonov to French ambassador to Russia Maurice Paléologue regarding Western Armenia and the Anglo-French Sykes–Picot Agreement. The agreement for Russian influence over Western Armenia was given in return for Russian assent to the Sykes-Picot arrangement. The agreement took place on the first anniversary of the Treaty of London.
Russia was allocated the vilayets of  Erzurum,  Trebizond, Bitlis and Van; much of which was under Russian occupation at the time.
