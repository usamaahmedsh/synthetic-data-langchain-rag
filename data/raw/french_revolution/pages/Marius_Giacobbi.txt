== Early years (1846–98) ==
Marius Giacobbi was born on 14 September 1846 in Lugo-de-Venaco (Venaco), Corsica.

The election was contested, but was eventually admitted.
Giacobbi sat on the committees for the colonies, navigation and fishing, and in 1899 was a member of the committee on administrative economies.

Giacobbi ran for election to the Senate in the triennial renewal of 4 January 1903 and was elected by 643 out of 774 voters.
He sat with the democratic left.

Venaco had a mayor named Giacobbi for 120 years from 1878, with an interlude between 1919 and 1922, including Marius, his son, grandson and great-grandson.
