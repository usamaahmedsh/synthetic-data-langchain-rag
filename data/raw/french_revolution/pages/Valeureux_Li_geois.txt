Valeureux Liégeois (French pronunciation: [valœʁø ljeʒwa], literally "Valiant people of Liège") is a patriotic song written in 1790 by Abbot Gilles-Joseph-Evrard Ramoux in the town of Liège at a time when the Liège Revolution was threatened by Austrian forces seeking the restoration of the Prince-bishop César-Constantin-François de Hoensbroeck.

Abbot Ramoux wrote Valeureux Liégeois in 1790 at the request of Lambert-Joseph de Donceel, a revolutionary and commander of the Liège militia who wanted a national song "to expel from the homes of our citizens the enemies of the fatherland who dared to enter".
