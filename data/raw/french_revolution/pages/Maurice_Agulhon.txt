Maurice Agulhon (20 December 1926 – 28 May 2014) was a French historian, specializing in the contemporary history of France of the 19th and 20th centuries, and professor at the Collège de France from 1986 to 1997. Although his early work focused on the Révolution of 1848 in Provence, Maurice Agulhon went on to become one of the leading specialists on the institutions of the French Republic and the symbolism of republican power. He was also politically committed to the left, initially with the French Communist Party.
