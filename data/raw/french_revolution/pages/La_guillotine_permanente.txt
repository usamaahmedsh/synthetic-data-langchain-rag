La guillotine permanente ("The permanent Guillotine") is a French revolutionary song from the French Revolution. The lyrics regard the guillotine and its usage as a weapon of the revolution.


== Background ==


=== Historic circumstances ===

Around the year 1789, the National Constituent Assembly was debating about a new criminal law for France. Among the representatives of the bourgeoisie was the doctor Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, who argued for an equalization of the capital punishment. He suggested that all executions may be carried out as a beheading through a "simple mechanism". Guillotin's efforts led to beheading machines being referred to as "Guillotine" when they were first regularly used in the year 1792. (Misleadingly, Guillotin is often called the "inventor of the guillotine". The lyrics of La guillotine permanente say that Guillotin "made" the machine. In reality, Guillotin was not involved in the design and construction of the guillotine.)


=== The melody ===
The melody of La guillotine permanente was known long before the French Revolution; its roots date back to the 16th century. The old folk song Si le roi m'avait donné is sung to this melody, Molière quoted it in his comical work The Misanthrope, which premiered in the year 1666. The lyrics of La guillotine permanente are not the only ones written to this melody during the French Revolution.
