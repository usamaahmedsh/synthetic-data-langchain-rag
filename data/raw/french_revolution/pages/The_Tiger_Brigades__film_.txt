The Tiger Brigades (French: Les Brigades du Tigre) is a 2006 French crime film. Based on a very successful 1970s-'80s French television series of the same name the film depicts an Untouchables-type crack "Flying Squad" once formed by then PM Georges Clemenceau to tackle rampant crime in 1912 Paris. The squads became known to the public as "Tiger Brigades", after Clemenceau's nickname "Le Tigre", and were among the first police units to be equipped with automobiles, telephones, telegraphs and seriously trained in French boxing and Canne de combat.
Gathering a talented pan-European cast, the film is set in the vibrant Belle Époque and deals with a lot of real historical plots and characters like the scandal of the Russian Loans, the Triple Entente, the birth of modern profiling and crime-fighting police techniques, international police cooperation, the new rivalry between Louis Lépine's PP (Paris Police Prefecture) Brigade Criminelle and Clémenceau's Brigade Mobile (ancestors of the current Central Directorate of the Judicial Police), the birth of Socialism and famous Anarchist Movements.
