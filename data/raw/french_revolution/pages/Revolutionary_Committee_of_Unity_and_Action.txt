Revolutionary Committee for Unity and Action (in French: Comité Révolutionnaire d'Unité et d'Action) was a militant group in Algeria formed in order to fight French rule. CRUA regrouped former elements of the OS and radical members of the MTLD. The CRUA was founded by 33 persons.
CRUA would later evolve into the FLN and produce the Declaration of 1 November 1954 written by the journalist Mohamed Aïchaoui.
