Jean Berthoin (January 12, 1895 – February 25, 1979) was a French politician. As Minister of National Education under Charles de Gaulle, he instituted a policy of compulsory education for all children, both French and foreign citizens, until the age of sixteen, building on the earlier reforms of 1936. Implemented in 1959, this was known as the Berthoin Ordinance. He also suggested that the Baccalauréat be abolished, prompting a significant backlash in the Parisian press.
Prior to World War II, Berthoin had been the director of national security (Sûreté) in the French Interior Ministry.
