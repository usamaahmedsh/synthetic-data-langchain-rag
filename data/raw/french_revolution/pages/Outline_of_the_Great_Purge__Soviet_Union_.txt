The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to English Wikipedia articles about the Great Purges.


== About ==
The Great Purge was a mass campaign of political repression in the Soviet Union from 1936 to 1938, orchestrated by Joseph Stalin and carried out by the NKVD under Genrikh Yagoda and later Nikolai Yezhov. Triggered by the 1934 Assassination of Sergei Kirov, it included show trials, executions, and the persecution of Old Bolsheviks, Red Army officers, intellectuals, and ethnic minorities such as Soviet Poles and Volga Germans.
The campaign peaked during 1937–1938, targeting alleged "enemies of the people" including supposed wreckers, kulaks, and political rivals. Torture, forced confessions, and mass executions became standard. An estimated 700,000 to 1.2 million people were killed, and many more were imprisoned or sent to the Gulag. Stalin nevertheless, was forced to stop the purge in 1938, denouncing the NKVD’s excesses and executing both Yagoda and Yezhov. Though the purge formally ended, state repression continued until around 1952. Leon Trotsky, a key Stalin rival, survived the purge but was assassinated in 1940 by the NKVD in Mexico.
