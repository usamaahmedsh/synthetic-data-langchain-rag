At the beginning of the Occupation, when Martinique was administered by Admiral Robert, Victor Sévère was fiercely opposed both to it and to the Vichy regime. In 1941, he was removed from the mayor's office in the capital and Admiral Robert appointed Jean de Laguarigue in his place. In 1942 he participated in the Resistance and was particularly noticed after the landing in North Africa. In 1943, he contributed to the formation of the National Liberation Committee which ensured that the West Indies joined the Free French Forces.
