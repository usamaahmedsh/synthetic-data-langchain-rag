A series of votes were held at the end of the trial of Louis XVI to determine his guilt and the appropriate punishment. After voting on two initial questions on Tuesday 15 January 1793, the députés considered sentencing over 37 uninterrupted hours of debate on Wednesday 16 and Thursday 17 January. Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud was president during these sessions.


== Questions ==
The debate on Monday 14 January was occupied with determining the wording of the resolutions to be voted on.
On Tuesday 15 January 1793, at the National Convention, a roll call vote took place on the first two questions:

1 "Is Louis Capet guilty of conspiracy against public liberty and attacks against the general security of the State, yes or no?"
2 "Should the judgment of the National Convention against Louis Capet be submitted to the ratification of the people, yes or no?"
The members from each département were called in turn, beginning with the letter G, with each announcing their votes from the podium.
Next, from 10:30 am on Wednesday 16 January until the evening of Thursday 17 January, without interruption, a roll-call vote was conducted on the third question, starting with the département of Haute-Garonne:

3 "What punishment should be imposed on Louis?"
It was then that Jean-Baptiste Mailhe, the first to speak, declared:
"As a natural consequence of the opinion that I have already expressed on the first question, I vote for the death of Louis. I will make only one observation. If death has the majority, I think that it would be worthwhile for the National Convention to examine whether it would not be politic and useful to hasten, or to delay, the moment of execution. This proposition is independent of my vote. I return to the first question and I vote for death."
Some members of the Convention complained that there had been irregularity in the voting in the third question. Following a debate, the Convention agreed that there would be a second roll-call vote in the third question, where each member would be asked to confirm their vote. This meant that there were a total of five votes on four substantive questions.
Mailhe's suggestion raised the question of whether, for any reason, the death sentence ought to be stayed. At the session on Saturday 19 January, despite fierce opposition from Jean-Paul Marat, on the motion of fr:René-Pierre Choudieu, the Convention decreed that it would immediately discuss the question of a reprieve, and that the question would be put as follows:

4 "Should there be a reprieve of the judgment against Louis Capet?" and that the answer was to be "yes" or "no".
The roll call vote was held in alphabetical order by département, starting with Gers.

(*-In late 1792 Joseph Mailhes declared himself unable to accept the position of député owing to illness, and resigned. On 13 December 1792 the General Council of the Cantal department appointed fr:Jean-Pierre Malhes to replace him. Malhes had been elected as the first substitute member in the elections to the Convention in September 1792. Malhes arrived in Paris on 17 January 17, 1793 and was promptly admitted to the Convention as Mailhes' replacement. However, as neither Mailhes nor Malhes was able to participate in the roll call votes, it is  Mailhes' name that appears in the register for those votes, followed by the words "absent due to illness" and "absent without cause").

== Results ==


=== First question ===
Is Louis Capet guilty of conspiracy against public liberty and attacks against the general security of the State, yes or no?
Number of députés in the Convention: 749


=== Second question ===
Should the judgment of the National Convention against Louis Capet be submitted for ratification by the people, yes or no?
Number of députés in the Convention = 749; absolute majority of those voting (not absent, abstaining or recusing themselves) = 355


=== Third question ===
What punishment should be imposed on Louis?
Number of députés in the Convention = 749; absolute majority of those voting (not absent, abstaining or recusing themselves) = 361

Note: During the session on Friday January 18, Gasparin and Delacroix reported errors “in the statement of the decree issued yesterday”. After checking, it turned out that the number of voters and the absolute majority remained the same, but that the votes of the 26 deputies who had voted for death with the Mailhe amendment ought to have been counted as voting unconditionally for death. The number of deputies who voted for unconditional death was therefore 387.


=== Fourth question ===
Should there be a reprieve of the judgment against Louis Capet, yes or no?
Number of députés in the Convention = 749; absolute majority of those voting (not absent, abstaining or recusing themselves) = 347
