The Capture of Hooly Honore, a town and fortress held by forces of the Kingdom of Mysore, occurred on 21 December 1791, after two days of siege by combined forces of the British East India Company and the Maratha Confederacy.  The battle was part of a campaign during the Third Anglo-Mysore War by Maratha leader Purseram to recover Maratha territories taken by Hyder Ali in an earlier conflict between Mysore and the Marathas.
