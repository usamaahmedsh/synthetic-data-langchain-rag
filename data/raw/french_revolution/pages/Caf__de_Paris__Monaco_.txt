== History ==

Founded in 1868, at the same time as Monte Carlo, with its Casino de Monte-Carlo and the Hôtel de Paris by François Blanc and Prince Charles III of Monaco, it was originally baptized Café Divan. It was transformed several times until the 1930s, then completely renovated in 1988 in the Belle Époque style of the 1900s like the old Parisian bistros.
Café de Paris underwent a 19 month renovation and reopened on 14 November 2023. The renovation cost approximately 55 million euros. In November 2023, Stéphane Tendero became the director of Café de Paris Monte-Carlo, succeeding Éric Gorjux, who had held the position since 2022.
It has large modular terraces with an orchestra and views of the Casino de Monte-Carlo and the Hôtel de Paris and its daily show of prestigious cars, with the Bellevue lounge of 340 m2 (3,700 sq ft) on the first floor.
The Casino has gaming rooms of over 13,000 m2 (140,000 sq ft) in a setting inspired by the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco.
