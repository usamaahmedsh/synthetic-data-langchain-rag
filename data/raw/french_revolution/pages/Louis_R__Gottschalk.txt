Louis Reichenthal Gottschalk (February 21, 1899 – June 23, 1975) was an American historian, an expert on the Marquis de Lafayette and the French Revolution. He taught at the University of Chicago, where he was the Gustavus F. and Ann M. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of History.


== Early life and education ==
He was born Louis Gottschalk, the sixth of eight children of Morris and Anna (née Krystal) Gottschalk, Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn from Poland. He graduated from Cornell University with an A.B. in 1919, A.M. in 1920, and the Ph.D. in 1921, under the supervision of Carl L. Becker.


== Career ==
During World War I, he served as an apprentice seaman from October 4, 1918, to November 11, 1918, a total of thirty eight days, at the Naval Unit at Cornell in Ithaca, New York. He taught briefly at the University of Illinois, and joined the University of Louisville faculty in 1923, but resigned in protest in 1927 after a friend and colleague in the history department was fired as part of an attempt by the university administration to abolish tenure.
In 1927, he joined the University of Chicago, where he was promoted to full professor in 1935, and chaired the history department from 1937 to 1942. He was given his endowed chair, the Gustavus F. and Ann M. Swift Distinguished Service Professorship of History, in 1959. In 1965, facing forced retirement from Chicago, he moved again to the University of Illinois at Chicago so that he could continue teaching.
From 1929 to 1943, he served as assistant editor of The Journal of Modern History for three years and then as acting editor. He was president of the American Historical Association in 1953 and the second president of the American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.
