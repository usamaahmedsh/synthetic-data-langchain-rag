After the victory at Waterloo of the coalition armies, the department was occupied by British forces from June 1815 till November 1818.

1851 - A republican department
Following President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's 1851 Coup d'état, Seine-Inférieure was one of several departments placed under a state of emergency (literally, in French, state of siege)  following fears of significant resistance to the new government.
World War II
In 1942, during occupation by Nazi Germany, two Allied raids, the Bruneval and Dieppe, took place at towns of the channel coast of Seine-Inférieure.

== Geography ==
The department can be split into three main areas:

The Seine valley. The Seine flows through the provincial capital Rouen.
The chalk plateau Pays de Caux, with its abrupt coastline (the Alabaster Coast).
The Norman Pays de Bray, with its hills and bocage landscape.

The département was created in 1790 as Seine-Inférieure, one of five departements that replaced the former province of Normandy. In 1800 five arrondissements were created within the département, namely Rouen, Le Havre, Dieppe, Neufchatel and Yvetot, although the latter two were disbanded in 1926. On 18 January 1955 the name of the département was changed to Seine-Maritime, in order to provide a more positive-sounding name and in-keeping with changes made in a number of other French departements.

The most populous commune is Le Havre; the prefecture Rouen is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 7 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants:
