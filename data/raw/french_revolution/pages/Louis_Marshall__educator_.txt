== Biography ==
He was the son of Thomas Marshall, and brother of U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall. He was educated at home, studied medicine in Edinburgh, and spent several years in Paris, participating in the attack upon the Bastille. He was arrested during the Reign of Terror and condemned to death, but was rescued by the intervention of his elder brothers. He attained note as a physician, but his taste for literature and languages caused him to abandon his profession, and he then established an academy in Woodford County, Kentucky. He was president of Washington College, Virginia, in 1838, and afterward of Transylvania University, Kentucky. He died in Woodford County, Kentucky, in 1866, one year after the end of the American Civil War.
