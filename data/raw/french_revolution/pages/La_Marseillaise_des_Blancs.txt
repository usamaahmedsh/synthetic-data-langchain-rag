La Marseillaise des Blancs (English: The Marseille [Song] of the 'Blancs') is a royalist and Catholic adaptation of the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The lyrical content of the Royal and Catholic variation is strongly counter-revolutionary and originated from the War in the Vendée in 1793, where locals attempted to resist the republican forces. The name "Blancs" refers to their use of royal white flags and symbols.

In the first verse, the term "blues" refers to the revolutionary republicans—the Jacobins. The Rodrigue mentioned in the second verse refers to François-Ambroise Rodrigue, a local bishop who collaborated with the Revolution, contrary to papal authority. Similarly, the "treasonous priests" in the fourth verse refers to certain "Constitutional priests", who swore loyalty to the government of the republican regime over the Pope; priests who refused such an oath had their parishes taken away from them and were replaced. In the same verse, the Camus mentioned is Armand-Gaston Camus, Secretary of the Revolutionary Convention, who played a major role in seizing Church property and the regicide of the King of France.
