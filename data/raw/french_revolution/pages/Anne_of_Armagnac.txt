Anne of Armagnac, Dame d'Albret, Countess of Dreux (1402 – before March 1473) was a French noblewoman and a member of the powerful Gascon Armagnac family which played a prominent role in French politics during the Hundred Years War and were the principal adversaries of the Burgundians throughout the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War. Anne was the wife of Charles II d'Albret.


== Family ==
Anne was born in 1402 in Gages, near Rodez, France, the daughter of Bernard VII of Armagnac, Count of Charolais, Count of Armagnac, and Bonne de Berry. Anne had six siblings; these included John IV of Armagnac, Bernard of Armagnac, and Bonne of Armagnac, wife of Charles, Duke of Orléans. She had three half-siblings from her mother's marriage to Count Amadeus, including Amadeus VIII of Savoy.
Her paternal grandparents were John II of Armagnac and Jeanne de Périgord, and her maternal grandparents were John, Duke of Berry and Jeanne of Armagnac.
Anne's father was head of the powerful, pro-French, pro-Orléans Armagnac party which played a prominent role in French politics in the early 15th century, and whose bitter opponents during the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War were the pro-English Burgundians, headed by John the Fearless. On 30 December 1415, her father was appointed Constable of France. He controlled the government of the Dauphin Charles (the future King Charles VII of France). On 12 June 1418, he was assassinated by rioting Parisians.
Anne died on an unknown date sometime before March 1473. Her husband Charles died in 1471. The lordship of Albret passed to Alain, the grandson of Charles and Anne; the county of Dreux went to Arnaud Amanieu, but was later seized by Alain.


== Marriage and issue ==
On 28 October 1417, a marriage contract was drawn up and signed, and less than six months later, on 23 April 1418, Anne married Charles II d'Albret, Sire d'Albret and titular Count of Dreux (1401–1471). He was the eldest son of Charles d'Albret, Constable of France who had been killed at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415, and of Marie de Sully, Princess of Boisbelle.

== Later years and death ==
In 1470, Anne is recorded as having owned une pierre pour toucher les yeux, enchassié en or (a stone for touching the eyes, set in gold). It is not known how or where she acquired this "magical stone" which allegedly had healing powers.
She died sometime before March 1473.
