During his time in the role, he would enthusiastically support French exploration of Africa whilst working to build the resources of the undersecretariat, giving the world "the impression that from the bulge of the Niger to the Mediterranean, everything was reserved for France.". By the time he left the role, his authority and influence had to extended to the point where he had gained access to regular meetings by the cabinet, and deputies would refer to the undersecretariat as being a ministry in all but name.
