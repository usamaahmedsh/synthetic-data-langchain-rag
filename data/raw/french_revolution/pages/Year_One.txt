The term "Year One" in political history usually refers to the institution of radical, revolutionary change. This usage dates from the time of the French Revolution. After the official abolition of the French monarchy on 21 September 1792, the National Convention instituted the new French Revolutionary Calendar. It declared the day after abolition – 22 September, redesignated as 1 Vendémiaire – to be the first day of the Republic and the beginning of Year I. The Maoist dictator Pol Pot (Saloth Sâr) was educated in Paris, France to join the French Communist Party as a student which was inspired by the French Revolutionary Calendar of Year One as well as the works of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror. The Cambodian Civil War had led the various campaigns of Operation Menu, Chenla Two and the Fall of Phnom Penh which declared the new revolutionary calendar as Year Zero on 17 April 1975, which the Queen Sisowath Kossamak fled to Beijing and Lon Nol heading to exile in Hawaii and then California as the people of every urban centers in Cambodia are evacuated into rural co-operatives which inspired by the Great Leap Forward by Chairman Mao. On 5 January 1976, Pol Pot who became ("Brother Number One") renamed the country from the Khmer Republic to Democratic Kampuchea established by Angkar which become a closed nation on earth.
