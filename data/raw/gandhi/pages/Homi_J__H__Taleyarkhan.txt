Homi J.H. Taleyarkhan (1912 – 27 June 1998) was an Indian Gandhian, Congress politician and a former Governor of Sikkim.
Before his gubernatorial posting, Taleyarkhan had served as a Minister of Housing and Civil Supplies of the Government of Maharashtra and as India's Ambassador to Libya.
Taleyarkhan served as the second Governor of Sikkim from 9 January 1981 to 17 June 1984. As governor, he persuaded the then Chief Minister Nar Bahadur Bhandari to merge his Sikkim Janata Parishad with the Indian National Congress but their relationship later soured.
A member of the Parsi community, he served as a member of the National Minorities Commission of India after his gubernatorial assignment from 1985–1990.  He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1992. He was a prolific writer, especially on Gandhi and Gandhism. Some of his books include From Warfare to Welfare: The Ideal of National Integration and the Splendor of Sikkim.
Homi J.H. Taleyarkhan: a man of devotion, dedication, and commitment is his biography by Sheshrao Chavan. He was married to Thrity Homi Taleyarkhan, a social activist and a former president of the Maharashtra State Women’s Council. The Homi J. H. Taleyarkhan Memorial Hospital and the Homi J. H. Taleyarkhan Memorial Hall in Mumbai have been named in his honour.
