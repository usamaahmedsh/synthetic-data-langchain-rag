This is the full list of "official" Power Lap times on the Top Gear test track.


== Qualifying vehicles ==
Top Gear define a qualifying vehicle as a road-legal production car on road-legal tires that has sufficient ride height to clear a standard speed bump. For these reasons the McMurtry Spéirling (0:55.9), F1 car (Renault R24) (0:59.0), Aston Martin DBR9 (1:08.6) and Sea Harrier (0:31.2) do not appear.  Whenever a non-qualifying vehicle is raced, the time is compared to the official power laps but then subsequently removed from the board. For example, the Ferrari FXX owned by Michael Schumacher (1:10.7) was taken off the board because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used slick tyres, and the Caparo T1 (1:10.6) was removed because its front wing was too low to drive over a speed bump.

== Unofficial laps ==

Independently reported lap times, not in connection with Top Gear series:

1:05.3 – Nissan ZEOD RC hybrid mode (internal combustion engine and electric motors).
1:12.6 – McLaren 720S - Series 25
1:12.8 – Ultima GTR. After Top Gear allegedly refused to drive it because "they thought it couldn't clear a speed bump", Ultima Sports, Ltd. drove the car from Surrey to the track and set the time, verified by Plans Motorsport.
1:13.2 – McLaren P1 tested by Motor Trend 2014
1:13.6 – Nissan ZEOD RC pure-electric vehicle mode.
1:14.2 – Ferrari LaFerrari. Set on 12 June 2015 in damp conditions by Jason Plato as part of television programme TFI Friday's twentieth-anniversary show
1:32.0 – Fiat Multipla - Set in 2019 by Stig (according to the video) driving the modified and engine-tuned Fiat Multipla "Multipla AMG" (151.8 hp - 336Nm - 1236 kg) from Vilebrequin's YouTube Channel (French).


== Time adjustments ==
Sometimes an additional term is written next to the time (such as Hot). This indicates that The Stig and the Top Gear team consider that the prevalent weather conditions have affected the lap time or car's performance. The time on the board is not changed: e.g. 1:50 MM (Mildly Moist) is deemed to be equivalent to 1:48 on a normal dry track. The following list describes how many seconds it costs a car or gives a car an advantage. These adjustments are also not applicable to Formula 1 drivers.
