== People recognized by bridge organizations ==


=== American Contract Bridge League ===


==== Hall of Fame ====

The first bridge Hall of Fame was inaugurated by The Bridge World in 1964 and invested nine members between then and 1966 after which it ceased sponsorship. The American Contract Bridge League adopted the concept to recognize the achievements and contributions of those residing in its territory (USA, Canada, Mexico and Bermuda) and inaugurated its own Hall of Fame in 1995 by accepting the original nine and adding eight others that year. Annually thereafter, new members have been added in as many as three award categories.

Open Award – "living individuals who have achieved prominence in the game of bridge and have an outstanding tournament record"
von Zedtwitz Award – "living or deceased individuals who have achieved prominence in the game of bridge and have an outstanding tournament record but who may not have been in the limelight for a significant period of time" (20 people in 19 years to 2014)
Blackwood Award – "individuals who have contributed greatly to the game of bridge without necessarily being world class players" (19 people to 2014)
Nominees in the Open category must have attained the age of 60 by 1 January of the year of the induction ceremony. The primary basis for consideration in the Open and von Zedtwitz categories is the player's North American and international record and achievements as a member and representative of the ACBL. An individual's personal history, whether good or bad, should be considered in nominating candidates or selecting recipients.
In 2008, ACBL established the Foundation for the Preservation and Advancement of Bridge (FPAB) "to support the preservation of bridge history, to recognize individuals for their excellence and service to the game of bridge and to inspire the participation of youth through scholarships and grants."


==== Most influential personalities ====

In 2012, the American Contract Bridge League celebrated the 75th anniversary of its creation by the merger of the American Bridge League and the United States Bridge Association in October 1937. In partial recognition, the League published a list of the 52 most influential personalities during its history.
Criteria included:

contributions to bidding theory that have stood the test of time;
contributions to bridge literature of enduring importance;
contributions to law, regulation or administration making bridge more accessible or more fun;
charisma that has broadened the appeal of bridge to non-players.
Selections were not limited to ACBL members or North American residents.

== Point leaders ==


=== American Contract Bridge League ===
Grand Life Masters (GLM) defined by lifetime ACBL master points (MP), with some condition on major achievements

MP leaders all-time, including deceased members, GLM only
Players of the Decade – defined by ACBL platinum master points

1990s
2000s
2010s – Leaders, 2010 to present


=== European Bridge League ===
Lists of the top European Master Points (EMP) holders in various categories and for various periods


=== World Bridge Federation ===
The World Bridge Federation measures achievement in tournament play by a dual system of Master Points and Placing Points
and provides ranked lists in Open, Women, and Seniors categories.
Short colloquialisms like "Fulvio Fantoni is number one in the world" refer to the WBF Open Ranking. It ranks by Master Points those all-time players whose Placing Points accord "World Grand Master" status. MPs decay but PPs do not, so retired and deceased World Grand Masters remain on the list but drift toward the bottom.


== Other listings ==


=== Video interviews ===
The American Contract Bridge League has published at YouTube audio-video interviews of numerous players including almost 30 members of its Hall of Fame. These listings include some other videos of bridge personalities published at YouTube. (Those marked "ACBL Hall of Fame" may be interviews conducted by Audrey Grant, as are the ones so marked.)
