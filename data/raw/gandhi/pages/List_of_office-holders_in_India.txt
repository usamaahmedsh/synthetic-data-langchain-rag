== List of rulers of Sultans of Delhi ==

Sultans of Delhi were the rulers of the Muslim empire based in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the subcontinent during the period of Medieval India, for 320 years (1206–1526). Following the conquest of South Asia by the Ghurids, five unrelated heterogeneous dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–1290), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414–1451), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526). It covered large swaths of territory in modern-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.
This list contains the rulers of Delhi Sultanate in chronological order.

== Vakil-i-Mutlaq ==

The Vakil-i-Mutlaq (Persian:  وکیلِ مطلق), variously translated as the Lieutenant Plenipotentiary, the Regent Plenipotentiary, the Vicegerent or the Imperial Regent, was an important office in the Government of the Mughal Empire, first in ministerial hierarchy and only next to Mughal Emperor. Vekil is an Arabic word which means "representative". The Vakil was considered as the Emperor's lieutenant in all matters connected with the realm and household. From the reign of Emperor Babur to Emperor Shah Jahan, the title of grand vizier was also given to the Vakil. But afterwards it remained only as dignitary post.
The degree of powers of the Vakil's office varied from era to era. However the Vakil required Emperor's approval in each and every decision. During the era of Babur and Humayun, he had the powers of prime minister while early in the reign of Akbar, Vakil Bairam Khan acted as regent and ruled on the behalf of Emperor. Bairam Khan had his own Vakil-i-Mutlaq, who in this case was a general manager. This position was held by Pir Muhammad Khan Shirwani and when he was temporarily dismissed, given to Haji Muhammad Sistani. In 1564, Akbar revived the office of Vakil and didn't give him the responsibilities of finance department. In the reign of Jahangir, the office of Imperial Diwan gained prominence and ultimately during Shah Jahan's regime, the title of grand vizier was transferred from Vakil's office to Imperial Diwan.

== List of governors of Portuguese India ==
The following is a list of rulers during the history of Portuguese India as a viceroyalty or governorship.

(*) – In 1508, King Manuel I of Portugal devised a plan to partition the Portuguese empire in Asia into three separate governments or "high captaincies" – (1) Captain-Major of the seas of Ethiopia, Arabia and Persia, centered at Socotra, was to cover the East African and Arabian-Persian coasts, from Sofala to Diu; (2) Captain-Major of the seas of India, centered at Cochin, was to cover the Indian coast from Diu down to Cape Comorin. Afonso de Albuquerque was Captain-General of the latter. Jorge de Aguiar was made Captain-General of the former. A third high captaincy, covering Asia east of Cape Comorin (yet to be explored) was assigned to Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, who was assigned that year to discover Malacca. The triarchy experiment failed – Aguiar drowned en route, while Sequeira quit the region in 1509, after his debacle at Malacca, leaving Albuquerque sole governor of the whole unpartitioned complex.
(**) – Around 1570, King Sebastian of Portugal tried to partition the Portuguese State of India into three separate governments (much like Manuel's plan of 1508) – a western state based around Sofala (covering the East African coast from Cape Correntes to Cape Guardafui), a central state ruled from Goa (covering the area between the Red Sea and Ceylon, encompassing India, reserved for the "Viceroy") and an eastern state ruled from Malacca (covering Southeast Asia, from Pegu to China). D. António de Noronha was appointed to Goa, António Moniz Barreto to Malacca, and Francisco Barreto (the former India governor) to Sofala.
(***) – Title of Viceroy of Indies extinguished by royal letter in 1771, replaced by Capitão-Geral (Captain-General) of the Indies.
