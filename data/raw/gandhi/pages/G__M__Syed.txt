Ghulam Murtaza Syed (17 January 1904 – 25 April 1995), known as G. M. Syed  was a Sindhi nationalist and politician, who is known for his scholarly work, later proposing ideological groundwork for separate Sindhi identity and laying the foundations of Sindhudesh movement. He is regarded as one of the founding fathers of modern Sindhi nationalism. He was known as "Saeen" by his supporters.

He restated his political propaganda of ideologies which advocated for Islamic principles, secularism, Sindhi nationalism and laid the basis for Sindhudesh Movement. He spent approximately thirty years of his life in imprisonment and house arrests for his political views. He was entitled as the prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International in 1995.
