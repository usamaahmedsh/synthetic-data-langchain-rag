== History ==
The University of the Punjab was established on 14 October 1882 at Lahore (now in Punjab, Pakistan). The fate of the university after the partition of India in 1947, was deliberated at the Punjab Partition Committee, with representatives from East Punjab advocating for a division of the university. The senate of the university voted to split the university, and the matter reached the Partition Council at the centre, but a decision could not be made. With no university for the colleges in its territory, the government in East Punjab was compelled to bring an ordinance to set up a new university on 27 September 1947. The new university was then established in Solan (Shimla) of the Indian Punjab as the "East Punjab University" on 1 October 1947. After 1947, the university had no campus of its own for nearly a decade. The administrative office was in Solan and the teaching departments functioned from Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Delhi, and Amritsar. The name was later shortened to Panjab University in 1950.

In 1956 the university was relocated to Chandigarh, on a red sandstone campus designed by Pierre Jeanneret under the guidance of Le Corbusier. Until the re-organisation of Punjab in 1966, the university had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla, Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were in the present-day states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. With the re-organisation of Punjab, the university became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organised state of Punjab and the union-territory of Chandigarh.
In April 2024, Panjab University in Chandigarh became one of the first universities in India to grant menstrual leave to female students, starting from the session 2024-25. The policy will allow leave of one day per one calendar month of teaching and maximum of four days leave per semester.
