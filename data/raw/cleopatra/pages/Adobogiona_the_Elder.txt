Adobogiona (fl. c. 90 BC – c. 50 BC) was a Galatian princess from Anatolia.  She was known as a mistress of Mithridates VI Eupator, and claimed he had fathered her children: a son, Mithridates of Pergamon, and a daughter, Adobogiona the Younger.   
Adobogonia was a member of the Trokmian dynasty, rulers of Galatia; her brother was the Galatian king, Brogitaros.  She was married to Menodotus, a wealthy citizen of Pergamon.  A large statue of her was set up in temple of Hera in Pergamon.
