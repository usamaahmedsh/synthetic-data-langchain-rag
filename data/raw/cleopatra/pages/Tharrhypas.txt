Tharrhypas (Greek: Θαρύπας, 430–392 BC) was a king of the Molossians and the great-great- grandfather of Alexander the Great.
He is mentioned by Thucydides as a minor in 429 BC.
He was the father of Alcetas I, and is said to have been the first to introduce southern Greek (namely Attic) cultural traits among Molossians.
