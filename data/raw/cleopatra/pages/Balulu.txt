Balulu (Sumerian: 𒁀𒇻𒇻, ba-lu-lu; fl. c. 2440 BC) was the final king of the First Dynasty of Ur, according to the Sumerian King List, which states he ruled for 36 years:

"... Mesh-ki-ang-Nanna, son of Mesannepada, was king, 36 years he ruled; Elulu, 25 years he ruled; Balulu, 36 years he ruled; 4 kings, the years: 171(?) they ruled. Ur with weapons was struck down; the kingship to Awan was carried off.
Both his reign and the dynasty came to an end when he was defeated by a king of Awan.
