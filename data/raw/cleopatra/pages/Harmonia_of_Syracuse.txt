Harmonia was a Sicilian princess of Magna Graecia, daughter of Gelo, the son of King Hiero II of Syracuse. She was the wife of Themistius.
According to Valerius Maximus, Harmonia did not commit suicide, but to prove the same courage as the girl who voluntarily took her place, she went in front of the murderers, saying she was the real princess, and was also killed.
