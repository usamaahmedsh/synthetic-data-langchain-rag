Antony and Cleopatra is a 1908 film directed by J. Stuart Blackton and Charles Kent and starring Maurice Costello and Florence Lawrence in the title roles, based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name. It was the first film to dramatize the ill-fated romance between Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII of Egypt. An earlier film by Méliès did depict Cleopatra, but on her own.
