== Synopsis ==
Three years after the events of Mr. Peabody & Sherman (2014), Mr. Peabody and his son Sherman host a live TV variety show out of their Manhattan penthouse, with various historical figures as their guests that are brought to them through the WABAC time machine. Half of the show is in a variety show format, with the other half being time travel adventures formatted like the original "Peabody's Improbable History" segments from the 1950s and 1960s.
This show also introduces new characters like the robotic Orchoptitron, the building manager Mr. Hobson, the notary Mrs. Hughes, and Peabody's downstairs neighbors Christine Bluestone and the Yakamora family. The janitor Old Bill also appears where he is mostly seen during the credits.

== Production ==
Chris Parnell replaced Ty Burrell as the voice of Mr. Peabody from the 2014 film Mr. Peabody & Sherman. He auditioned for the role about a year and a half before the series' premiere. Trying to replicate Bill Scott's voice from the original cartoons as close as possible, he prepared by watching the 1960s show, and ended up doing his own interpretation of the character.


== Soundtrack ==

A soundtrack for the first season of the series was released digitally on October 2, 2015, and was released on CD in December 2015. Published by Lakeshore Records, the album features original score and the opening theme song by Eric Goldman and Michael Corcoran (aka The Outfit), and new original songs by Jukebox the Ghost, JD McPherson, Wordsworth and Prince Paul, and Ra Ra Riot., along with original songs performed by the cast of the series.
