Enakalle or Enakalli (Sumerian: 𒂗𒀉𒆗𒇷; fl. c. 2450 BC) was the king of Umma, a Sumerian city-state, during the Early Dynastic III period (2600–2350 BC). His reign lasted at least 8 years.

Ush, who may have been his successor, attacked nearby Lagash after ripping out the stele of Mesilim, trying to take Gu-Edin, as recording in the Cone of Entemena. Ush was severely defeated by Eannatum of Lagash, in a battle recorded in the Stele of the Vultures, losing 3,600 men in battle. Ush was then toppled and put to death by his own people.
Enakalle, his successor, finally made a peace treaty with Eannatum of Lagash, as described in the Cone of Entemena:
