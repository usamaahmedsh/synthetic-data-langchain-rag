The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour is an American variety show starring American pop singers Sonny Bono and Cher, who were married to each other at the time. The show ran on CBS in the United States, and premiered in August 1971. The show was cancelled in May 1974, due to the couple's divorce, but the duo reunited in 1976 for the similarly formatted The Sonny and Cher Show (a title sporadically used during the run of the Comedy Hour), which ran for two seasons, ending August 29, 1977.


== The Sonny & Cher Nitty Gritty Hour (1971) ==
The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour was preceded by a one-off television special titled The Sonny & Cher Nitty Gritty Hour. Commissioned by the Canadian network CTV, it was recorded in 1970 and aired on May 31, 1971, at 8:30 p.m. on Channel 9 in Toronto. The special featured guest appearances by Sandy Baron, Suzanne Charney, Billy Van, Jerelyn Homer, psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers and Andrea Davidson of the National Ballet of Canada. The Sonny & Cher Nitty Gritty Hour was produced by Ernest D. Glucksman, directed by Tim Kiley and executive produced by Philip Wedge. The writing team included Sandy Baron, Neal Marshall and Dennis Klein.
The program combined musical performances with comedic sketches, focusing on themes of relationships and gender dynamics. Sonny and Cher performed "We've Only Just Begun" and humorously portrayed their professional partnership. A recurring "battle of the sexes" theme featured sketches on topics such as in-laws and household dynamics. Cher performed "Alfie" in a solo number exploring modern women's conflicts, illustrated through contrasting dance styles—one representing innocence, the other experience—culminating in Cher dancing in underwear, symbolizing her struggle between traditional and contemporary values. The special also presented portrayals of historical couples such as Samson and Delilah, Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella, and Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. Other segments included "I'm Getting Married", a comedy sketch with Billy Van and Sandy Baron, and an advice feature with Dr. Joyce Brothers providing relationship insights.
Although sometimes described as a pilot to CBS's The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, the Nitty Gritty Hour was originally produced and broadcast exclusively in Canada. In 2015, choreographer David Winters claimed he initially conceived Sonny and Cher's television format, envisioning a comedy-music blend with playful insults between Sonny and Cher. According to Winters, he developed the concept as a TV special and pilot, aiming for an ABC summer series, but the network chose the Smothers Brothers instead. He alleged that CBS later copied the idea, hired new producers and writers, and signed Sonny and Cher for their own series, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, which became a major hit. Despite feeling wronged, Winters said he refrained from legal action to avoid conflicts with a major network but remained convinced his idea was the foundation of the successful CBS show.

By 1971, Sonny & Cher had stopped producing hit singles as a duet act. Cher's first feature film, Chastity, was not a success, and the duo decided to sing and tell jokes in nightclubs across the country. CBS head of programming Fred Silverman saw them one evening and offered them their own show. The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour was originally supposed to be a summer replacement series, but high ratings gave Silverman sufficient reason to bring it back later that year, with a permanent spot on the schedule. The show was taped at CBS Television City in Hollywood.
The show was a top-20 hit in the ratings for its entire run. Each episode opened with the show's theme song, which segued into the first few notes of "The Beat Goes On". Every episode, Sonny exchanged banter with Cher, allowing Cher to put down Sonny in a sarcastic, yet comic manner. Comedy skits followed, mixed with musical numbers.  At the end of each episode, Sonny and Cher sang their hit "I Got You Babe" to the audience.
Many regular cast members appeared in sketches.  Some notables include Teri Garr, Murray Langston (who later found brief fame as "The Unknown Comic" on The Gong Show), and Steve Martin (who also served as one of the show's writers). Regulars included:

Peter Cullen (1971–1974)
Freeman King (1971–1974)
Murray Langston (1971–1974)
Clark Carr (1971–1972)
Tom Solari (1971–1972)
Ted Zeigler (1971–1974)
Steve Martin (1972–1975)
Billy Van (1973–1976)
Bob Einstein (1973–1974)
Teri Garr (1973–1974)
Gene Merlino (1971–1974)
Among the many guests who appeared on The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour were Carol Burnett, George Burns, Glen Campbell, Tony Curtis, Bobby Darin, Phyllis Diller, Merv Griffin, the Jackson 5, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ronald Reagan, Burt Reynolds, The Righteous Brothers, Dinah Shore, Sally Struthers, the Supremes, Chuck Berry, and Dick Clark.
The show was scheduled to return for a fourth season in October 1974, but Sonny and Cher separated that fall, resulting in the cancellation of the show.
In 2004, selected episodes from The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour were released in a three-disc set called The Sonny & Cher Ultimate Collection: The Best of The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and The Sonny and Cher Show on Region 1 DVD.


=== Recurring routines ===
The Vamp Sketch: A sequence featuring at least three mini-skits, Cher played notorious women in history (e.g.: Cleopatra, Nefertiti, Marlene Dietrich), each one preceded by Cher in a parlor setting lying atop an old-style upright piano with Sonny pretending to play, singing one verse of the song between each mini-skit (the lyrics usually set up the next mini-skit), followed by the chorus, "She was a scamp, a camp and a bit of a tramp, she was a V-A-M-P, vamp". It ended with all the characters from each skit (even Sonny and Cher, via camera trickery, in their respective costumes) all converging to sing the final chorus together. In later seasons, the Vamp sketch was replaced with "Shady Miss Lady Luck", a similar group of mini-sketches that were bracketed by Cher in a Las Vegas-style setting.
Sonny's Pizza: Sonny is the proprietor of a pizza restaurant whose food, according to almost everyone except Sonny himself, is not fit to be eaten (the logo on the front door is augmented with the slogan, "You won't believe you ate the whole thing", a play on the then-popular Alka-Seltzer commercial).
Mr. & Ms.: This gender-bending sketch has Cher as the breadwinner in the household, working as a business executive and wearing a three-piece suit. She would come home to Sonny, a beleaguered house-husband who usually complained about how bad his day had been.
The Fortune Teller: Cher is inside a fortune-telling vending machine. When Sonny inserted a quarter to hear his fortune, she would give bad news or insults, but anyone else, particularly a given week's guest star, would get a good fortune that would almost immediately come true.
At the Launderette: A laundromat sketch that has Cher as Laverne, a housewife with tacky fashion sense cracking jokes to straight-woman Olivia, played by Garr.


== The Sonny Comedy Revue (1974) ==
In 1974, Sonny and Cher agreed to end the show, as they were separating from each other. Their timeslot was given to Tony Orlando and Dawn the next fall. They both starred in separate variety shows over the next two years. Sonny Bono's 1974 variety series, The Sonny Comedy Revue, led off the ABC Sunday-night lineup, but lasted just 13 episodes. While it retained the creative team behind The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, Bono's solo effort was largely a victim of the show's weak time slot and the established hits it faced on NBC and CBS. Initially, when  Cher was reported as appearing in her own show on CBS, TV Guide predicted that Sonny's show would be the greater success.


== Cher (1975–1976) ==
Starting in early 1975, Cher also returned to network television with her solo variety show, entitled Cher, which also aired on CBS.  It did well during its abbreviated run and was renewed for the 1975–76 season. During the second season, though, Cher herself decided to end the show to work with Sonny again. Although Sonny's show had most of the cast and crew from the comedy hour (except the musical director) and was expected to be the bigger hit, Cher's show easily became the greater success, both in the ratings and by fan response. Due to contracts, Cher was unable to perform many of her sketches and characters from the comedy hour on her show; Sonny had them on his show, instead.
Among the many guests who appeared on the Cher show were Bette Midler, Elton John, Pat Boone, David Bowie, Ray Charles, Steve Martin, The Jackson 5, Ike & Tina Turner, Dion, Wayne Newton, Linda Ronstadt, Flip Wilson, Lily Tomlin, Frankie Valli, Tatum O'Neal, Raquel Welch, Wayne Rogers, and Labelle.


== The Sonny and Cher Show (1976–1977) ==
In February 1976, with the bitterness of their divorce behind them, the couple reunited for The Sonny and Cher Show. This incarnation of the series was produced by veteran musical variety-show writers, Frank Peppiatt and John Aylesworth. It was basically the same format as their first variety series, but with different writers to create new sketches and songs. A new logo – a stylized hand with fingers crossed – symbolized their working relationship.
The duo's opening conversations were markedly more subdued and made low-key references to the couple's divorce, as well as Cher's subsequent marriage to Gregg Allman. (During production, Cher was pregnant with and eventually bore Allman's son, Elijah). Some jokes would become awkward; in one opening segment Cher gave Sonny a compliment, and Sonny jokingly replied "That's not what you said in the courtroom!" Nonetheless, the revived series garnered enough ratings to be renewed for a second season. By this time, however, the variety show genre was already in steep decline, and Sonny and Cher was one of the few successful programs of the genre remaining on the air. The show's final season, which aired as a mid-season replacement in the winter of 1977, was moved to the Friday night death slot, with the last episodes burned off in a late-evening Monday nighttime slot not typically used for comedy or variety series that summer.
The cast of regulars included Comedy Hour alums Ted Zeigler and Billy Van, Gailard Sartain (on loan from Peppiatt and Aylesworth's other series Hee Haw), announcer Jack Harrell (who later gained fame as the longtime announcer for the original version of The People's Court), and mime duo Shields and Yarnell.  Billy Van left the show during season 1.
Some of the guests who appeared on The Sonny and Cher Show included Frankie Avalon, Muhammad Ali, Raymond Burr, Ruth Buzzi, Charo, John Davidson, Barbara Eden, Neil Sedaka, Farrah Fawcett, Bob Hope, Don Knotts, Jerry Lewis, Tony Orlando, The Osmonds, Debbie Reynolds, The Smothers Brothers, Tina Turner, Twiggy, The Jacksons, and Betty White.


== Production notes ==
The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour taped its opening and closing segments in front of a live studio audience. The Sonny & Cher "concert" segment was also taped in front of the same audience, as were some of the segments featuring musical guest stars—as these typically were taped after the closing segment was completed. Due to blocking, costuming, and other staging and production requirements, most of the comedy segments were taped without an audience, with a laugh track added in postproduction.

== Syndication ==
Reruns of the series were seen on TV Land at the time of its launch in April 1996, with both the 1971–74 series and the 1976–77 series being treated as one; however, only about 65 of the original 100 episodes were aired. TV Land then edited the shows down to 30-minute episodes from the original hour, and ultimately discontinued broadcasting the series in 2000. From 2016 to 2020, getTV broadcast several episodes of both the 1971–74 and 1976–77 series, including some which had never aired on TV Land. In addition, getTV also carried the series Cher under a separate contract.
