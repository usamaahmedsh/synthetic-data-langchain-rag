Nanum or Nanium (died c. 2190 BC), according to the Sumerian King List, was one of four rivals (the others being Ilulu, Igigi, and Imi) vying to be king of Akkad during a three-year period following the death of Shar-Kali-Sharri. This chaotic period came to an end when Dudu consolidated his power over the realm.
