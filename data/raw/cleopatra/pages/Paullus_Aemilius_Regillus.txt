== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
He was the son of the consul and censor Paullus Aemilius Lepidus and Claudia Marcella the Younger, who was a daughter of Octavia the Younger and thus a niece of the Roman emperor Augustus. From his father's previous marriage, Regillus had two half-brothers and one half-sister. He was born c. 15 BC/14 BC. His father died shortly after his birth, and his mother subsequently remarried. Regillus was born and raised in Rome. Through his half-brother Marcus Valerius Messalla Barbatus, he was the uncle of the Roman Empress Valeria Messallina.


=== Career ===
Regillus' political career was contemporaneous with the rule of the Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius, during which he served as a quaestor. During the reign of Tiberius (14 to 37), Regillus was one of the emperor's comites, an imperial legate and proconsul of a Roman province. According to inscriptional evidence, Regillus was patron of Saguntum.
