Marcus Valerius Messalla Appianus (also known as Marcus Valerius Messalla Barbatus Appianus; c. 45 BC – 12 BC) was a Roman Senator during the reign of Augustus. He was ordinary consul in 12 BC with Publius Sulpicius Quirinius as his colleague.


== Family background ==
Not much is known about his family background and early life. Appianus may have been the son of Appius Claudius Pulcher, the consul of 38 BC. He was probably adopted by Marcus Valerius Messalla, suffect consul 32 BC, thus becoming Marcus Valerius Messalla Barbatus Appianus.


== Political career ==
According to the French historian Fr. François Catrou et Rouillé, Appianus served as a quaestor in the army of the Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. After this, little is known about his remaining political career beyond his consulship in 12 BC. He died not long afterwards.


== Marriage and issue ==
About 14 BC, Appianus married Claudia Marcella Minor, a daughter of Octavia the Younger; Claudia Marcella Minor's maternal uncle was the Roman emperor Augustus. Marcella bore Appianus two children, a daughter Claudia Pulchra and a son Marcus Valerius Messalla Barbatus. Although there has been some speculation that Claudia's father might actually have been Publius Claudius Pulcher, the son of Clodius.
