Seth Meribre was an Ancient Egyptian petty king during the early 13th Dynasty during the late Middle Kingdom.


== Attestations ==
Seth Meribre is only attested in the Turin King List dating to the time of Ramesses II. There is no certain contemporary evidence of this king, except for two speculative suggestions. The lack of archaeological evidence would indicate his reign was very short.


=== Stela, Abydos JE 35256 (weak) ===
At Abydos, a stele dated to a regnal Year 4 and dedicated to preserving the procession road in the area of Wepwawet was usurped by Neferhotep I in the mid-late 13th Dynasty. Anthony Leahy (1989) suggested the stele had been usurped from Wegaf. Von Beckerath (1965:56) suggested Sobekhotep III. Ryholt (1997) argued that the stele was taken from Meribre Seth.


=== Lintel, Medamud JE 44944 (weak) ===
At Medamud, a temple has yielded many ruined structures and architectural remains. Some may have been erected by Seth Meribre, but were subsequently usurped by his successor Sobekhotep III. In particular, a lintel from Medamud and now in the Egyptian Museum, JE 44944, bears almost-erased signs corresponding to Seth Meribre's nomen.


=== Architectural elements, Medamud JE 13891 (weak) ===

At Medamud, architectural elements may have been erected by Seth Meribre, but were subsequently usurped by his successor Sobekhotep III.

==== Turin King List ====
The Turin King List 7:23 (Alan Gardiner and Jürgen von Beckerath: col. 6 row 23) mentions "The Dual King Meribra Seth ... 6 days". He is preceded by Sehotepkara Intef (7:22) and succeeded by Sekhemre Wadjtawy Sobekhotep (7:24). The duration of Seth Meribre's reign is lost in a lacuna of the Turin canon, except for the end "... [and] 6 days".


== Theories ==
The Egyptologists Darrell Baker and Kim Ryholt place Seth Meribre as the twenty-fourth ruler of the 13th Dynasty, while Jürgen von Beckerath sees him as the twentieth king. These authors agree, however, that Seth Meribre probably usurped the throne at the expense of his predecessor, Sehetepkare Intef.
Kim Ryholt gives a total of 10 years for the combined reigns of Imyremeshaw, Sehetepkare Intef and Seth Meribre. Furthermore, following Papyrus Boulaq 18, there are reasons to believe that either Imyremeshaw or Sehetepkare Intef reigned for over five years, thus leaving less than 5 years to Seth Meribre.
Jürgen von Beckerath believes that Seth Meribre can be identified with a king mentioned on Genealogy of Ankhefensekhmet of the much later 22nd Dynasty. This king bears the name "Aaqen", literally  The donkey is strong. Von Beckerath proposes that this refers to Seth Meribre and that the name originally was "Sethqen", that is, Seth is strong. Indeed, since the god Seth had been ostracized during the 22nd Dynasty, the hieroglyph of the Seth-animal had been replaced by the hieroglyph of the donkey, yielding "Aaqen".
Seth Meribre may have been the twenty-fourth pharaoh and reigned from Memphis, ending in 1749 BC or c. 1700 BC. The length of his reign is not known for certain; the Egyptologist Kim Ryholt proposes that he reigned for a short time, certainly less than ten years.
