Virginia Mayo (born Virginia Clara Jones; November 30, 1920 – January 17, 2005) was an American actress and dancer. She was in a series of popular comedy films with Danny Kaye and was Warner Bros.' biggest box-office draw in the late 1940s. She also co-starred in the 1946 Oscar-winning movie The Best Years of Our Lives.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Mayo was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of newspaper reporter Luke and his wife, Martha Henrietta (née Rautenstrauch) Jones. Her family had roots back to the earliest days of St Louis, including great-great-great grandfather Captain James Piggott, who founded East St. Louis, Illinois, in 1797. Virginia's aunt operated an acting school in the St. Louis area, which Virginia began attending at age six. She also had a series of dancing instructors engaged by her aunt.


=== Vaudeville ===
Following her graduation from Soldan High School at age 16 in 1937, Virginia landed her first professional acting and dancing jobs at the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre (more commonly known as "The Muny") and in an act with six other girls at the Hotel Jefferson. Performer Andy Mayo, impressed with her ability, recruited her to appear in his act, "Morton and Mayo".
She toured the American vaudeville circuit for three years, serving as ringmaster and comedic foil for "Pansy the Horse," performed by Andy Mayo and his partner, Nonnie Morton, in a horse suit. They appeared together in some short films and were a huge hit in New York at Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in the Broadway theater district, where she was spotted by Samuel Goldwyn.


=== Broadway ===
In 1941, then officially known by her stage name Virginia Mayo, she got another career break when she appeared on Broadway with Eddie Cantor in Banjo Eyes.


=== Sam Goldwyn ===

In the early 1940s, Virginia Mayo's talent and striking beauty came to the attention of movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn, who signed her to an acting contract with his company. 
Goldwyn only made a few films a year and usually lent out the actors he had under contract to other producers. Her first notable role was in Jack London (1943), which starred her future husband Michael O'Shea for producer Samuel Bronston.
Mayo was placed in the chorus of the film Up in Arms just so she could learn, but she was never officially a member of the Goldwyn Girls. Then, RKO borrowed her for a support role in a musical, Seven Days Ashore (1944).


=== Stardom ===

Mayo's first starring role came in 1944 opposite comedian Bob Hope in The Princess and the Pirate (1944), a spoof of pirate movies made by Goldwyn. It earned over $3 million at the box office. Goldwyn then made her Danny Kaye's leading lady for the musicals Wonder Man (1945) and The Kid from Brooklyn (1946), both very popular.
Going against the previous stereotype, Mayo accepted the supporting role of unsympathetic gold digger Marie Derry in William Wyler's drama The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) for Goldwyn. Her performance drew favorable reviews from critics.  The film also became the highest-grossing film in the US since Gone with the Wind. At the zenith of her career, Mayo was seen as the quintessential voluptuous Hollywood beauty. She was said to "look like a pinup painting come to life." In a film review in The New York Times, critic Bosley Crowther wrote of Mayo, "As a comedy actress, [she] is no better than a rather weak script. But as a model for bathing apparel—well, do you or do you not like bathing suits?" According to widely published reports from the late 1940s, the Sultan of Morocco declared her beauty to be "tangible proof of the existence of God."
Eagle-Lion Films borrowed her to play the lead in Out of the Blue (1947), a comedy with George Brent.
Mayo was reunited with Kaye in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947), another big success, and A Song Is Born (1948), a box-office disappointment. In between, Warner Bros. borrowed her for the lead in a film noir, Smart Girls Don't Talk (1948).


=== Warner Bros. ===

Warner Bros. ended up taking over her contract from Goldwyn.  They starred her in another film noir, Flaxy Martin (1949) with Zachary Scott, then she did a Western with Joel McCrea and director Raoul Walsh, Colorado Territory (1949), and a comedy with Ronald Reagan, The Girl from Jones Beach (1949).
Mayo received excellent reviews in another unsympathetic role, playing James Cagney's sultry and scheming wife in the gangster classic White Heat (1949), also for Walsh. Mayo admitted she was frightened by Cagney as the psychotic gunman in White Heat because he was so realistic.
Roy Del Ruth borrowed her to play opposite George Raft in Red Light (1949), and she was Milton Berle's leading lady in Always Leave Them Laughing (1949).

Mayo was top-billed in the film noir Backfire (1950), and she was a huge hit in The Flame and the Arrow (1950) as Burt Lancaster's love interest.
She co-starred again with James Cagney and a young Doris Day in The West Point Story (1950), singing and dancing with Cagney, and was Gregory Peck's leading lady in Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N. (1951), Warner Bros. most popular film of the year. She co-starred with Kirk Douglas in a Western for Walsh, Along the Great Divide (1951).
Mayo starred opposite Dennis Morgan in David Butler's Technicolor musical, Painting the Clouds with Sunshine (1951) which was a moderate success. While Mayo appeared in several musicals, using her dance training, her voice was always dubbed.

Mayo appeared in the all-star cast of Starlift (1951) and was top-billed in She's Working Her Way Through College (1952) with Reagan. She was Alan Ladd's leading lady in The Iron Mistress (1952), a popular biopic of Jim Bowie, and starred in another musical, She's Back on Broadway (1953).
Mayo appeared in the comedy-drama-action film South Sea Woman (1953) with Burt Lancaster and Chuck Connors. RKO borrowed her for a Western in 3-D, Devil's Canyon (1953), and she co-starred with Rex Harrison and George Sanders in King Richard and the Crusaders (1954).
She was top-billed in The Silver Chalice (1954) opposite Pier Angeli and Paul Newman in his film debut.  The film was a notorious flop.


=== After Warner Bros. ===

Benedict Bogeaus gave her the lead in Pearl of the South Pacific (1955). Edmund Grainger cast her in Great Day in the Morning (1956), with Robert Stack, directed by Jacques Tourneur.
Mayo went to 20th Century Fox to play Robert Ryan's leading lady in The Proud Ones (1956), then she did Congo Crossing (1956) at Universal.
Mayo was reunited with Ladd in The Big Land (1957) made back at Warner Bros. She played Cleopatra in the 1957 fantasy film The Story of Mankind.  
Mayo made The Tall Stranger (1957) with McCrea for Allied Artists, Fort Dobbs (1958) with Clint Walker and Westbound (1959) with Randolph Scott, both at Warner Bros. Her last film of the decade was 1959's Jet Over the Atlantic. She began guest-starring on television shows such as Wagon Train, The Loretta Young Show, and Lux Playhouse.


=== 1960s ===
Mayo and her husband, actor Michael O'Shea, made a pilot for a TV series McGarry and His Mouse (1960), which was not picked up. She went to Italy to make Revolt of the Mercenaries (1961).
Mayo's film career tapered off considerably. She appeared in Young Fury (1965) with Rory Calhoun, Castle of Evil (1966), and Fort Utah (1967) with John Ireland.  She also guest starred on shows such as Burke's Law and Daktari and appeared onstage in such plays as That Certain Girl (1967) and Barefoot in the Park (1968) with Lyle Talbot. 


=== Later career ===
Mayo acted on stage for the rest of her career, mostly in dinner theatre and touring shows. Productions included No, No Nanette (1972), 40 Carats (1975), Good News (1977), Move Over Mrs Markham (1980) and Butterflies Are Free (1981).
Mayo continued to occasionally appear on television in shows such as Police Story, Night Gallery, The Love Boat, Remington Steele, and Murder, She Wrote, and a dozen episodes of the soap opera Santa Barbara.
Mayo was one of many famous actors to make a cameo appearance in the all-star box office bomb Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood (1976). She had roles in Lanigan's Rabbi (1977), Haunted (1977), and French Quarter (1978). Later film appearances were in Evil Spirits (1990), Midnight Witness (1993) and The Man Next Door (1997), which was her last film role.
Mayo was one of the first to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Hers is located at 1751 Vine Street. In 1996, she was honored by her hometown as she received a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 1993, Mayo published a Christmas themed children's book entitled, Don't Forget Me, Santa Claus through Barrons Juveniles Publishers.

Mayo wed actor Michael O'Shea in 1947, and they remained married until he died in 1973. The couple had one child, Mary Catherine O'Shea (born in 1953). For several decades, the family lived in Thousand Oaks, California.
