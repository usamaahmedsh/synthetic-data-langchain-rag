== Composition ==

The opening track on Williams' second studio album, Girl (2014), "Marilyn Monroe" begins with an orchestral string introduction. The song's production is characterized by Williams' signature "skittering" beat and "bumping" bass line, and its lyrics discuss "helpless romantics and the perfect lady." Its chorus contains references to several female historical figures, including actress Marilyn Monroe, Egyptian queen Cleopatra, and French heroine Joan of Arc. In the song's lyrics, Williams dismisses all three as "[meaning] nothing to [him]" and laments that he "just [wants] a different girl." Kelly Osbourne provides spoken backing vocals on the song.

The music video for the song, directed by Luis Cerveró, was released on April 23, 2014. It features Williams admiring and performing with different women on numerous sets.


=== Plot ===
The video begins with Williams admiring a woman on a dreamy set; when he goes to embrace her, she disappears into air. This is revealed to be a dream as Williams wakes up and bikes to a female dance class. After mingling with his bandmates and the dancers, he performs the song's chorus with them. During sections in the chorus where Williams repeats the word "Girl", multiple brief scenes of different women are shown. Next, Williams walks to a set divided into three colors (red, blue, and white), with groups of female dancers assigned to each of them. During an instrumental interlude, girls in casual outfits are also shown performing choreography on a rooftop, on which Williams and Osbourne emerge, an arrow in the former's heart. Williams is next shown back on the dream set, where the first woman reappears, this time playing a bass inside an artificial moon. During the final chorus, Pharrell and a large group of girls perform together, with him singing right near a woman dressed in the multi-color set's all three colors.
