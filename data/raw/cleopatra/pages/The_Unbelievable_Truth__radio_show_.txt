The Unbelievable Truth is a BBC Radio 4 comedy panel game devised by Graeme Garden and Jon Naismith. The game is chaired by David Mitchell and is described in the programme's introduction as "the panel game built on truth and lies." The object of the game is for each panellist to deliver a short lecture about a given subject, which should be completely false save for five true statements which they must attempt to smuggle past the other players. The first series began broadcasting in 2007, and the 31st series began airing in April 2025.


== Reception ==
The Guardian's Elisabeth Mahoney reviewed the programme positively: "From the first moments of its plinky plonky theme tune, The Unbelievable Truth is a delight". The Guardian's Zoe Williams, however, was critical of the programme, writing: "The Unbelievable Truth, for instance, should never have been recommissioned. It's only funny when Clive Anderson is speaking."
The BBC received "almost 50" complaints about insensitivity after David Mitchell opened a fourth series episode with the joke: "There is absolutely no truth in the rumour that the last line in Anne Frank's diary reads: 'Today is my birthday; dad bought me a drum kit'."
It won the "Best Radio Panel Show" award at the British Comedy Guide's 2011 and 2016 awards.
