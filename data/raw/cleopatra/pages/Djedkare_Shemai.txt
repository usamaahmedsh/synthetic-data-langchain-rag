Djedkare Shemai (sometimes referred to as Djedkare II because of Djedkare Isesi) may have been an ancient Egyptian king during the Eighth Dynasty of the First Intermediate Period. His name is only attested on the Abydos King List, the primary source for identifying seventh/eighth dynasties (combined). Djedkare Shemai is absent from the Turin canon as a large lacuna in this document affects most kings of the 7th/8th Dynasty. No contemporary document or building with his name has been found.
