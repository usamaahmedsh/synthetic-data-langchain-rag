Titus Ollius (died AD 31) was a prominent Roman citizen and the father of Poppaea Sabina, the Empress consort of the Roman Empire. His origins lay in Cupra Maritima, a town of Picenum; an inscription found there bears his name and that of three of his freedmen. Ollius was implicated in Sejanus' conspiracy against Tiberius, and committed suicide.
