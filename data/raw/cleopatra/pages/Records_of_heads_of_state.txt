Japanese legendary emperors, according to the ancient Japanese calendar, reigned for very long terms of 60–70 years each. The longest of these reigns was that of Emperor Kōan, who was claimed to have reigned for about 101 years. These figures are not included in the list because they are regarded as inaccurate by modern scholars. For those, see Longevity myths.

== Ruling houses ==


=== Oldest ===
Officially, the current Emperor of Japan, Naruhito is the 126th in line from the first emperor, Jimmu, who is variously believed to have reigned in the 1st or 7th century BC. The earliest documented evidence is only for the 29th emperor, Kinmei (AD 509–571); however, this is sufficient such that even the most conservative of estimates still places the Japanese imperial family as among the oldest lines in the world today.


== Post-nominal numbers ==
The highest post-nominal number representing a member of a royal house is 75, used by Count Heinrich LXXV Reuss zu Schleiz (r. 1800–1801). All male members of the branch were named Heinrich, and were successively numbered from I upwards, from the beginning of each century.


== Physical attributes ==


=== Heaviest ===
The heaviest monarch is believed to have been Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, King of Tonga from 1965 to 2006, who at his peak in 1976 was measured as being 208.7 kg (460 lb, or 32 st 12 lb), though he subsequently lost around 40% of his weight.


=== Tallest ===
The tallest height of a president is that of Filip Vujanović of Montenegro standing at 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m) tall.
One of the tallest rulers in history was Dusan the Mighty, who was King of Serbia (1331–1345) and later Tsar of Serbs, Greeks, and Bulgarians (1346–1355). He was 214 centimetres (7 ft 0 in) tall, in that time the average height was 165–170 centimetres (5 ft 5 in – 5 ft 7 in), so he searched all over Europe to find 101 men over 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall to be part of his personal guard.
On the other hand, Herodotus wrote in Histories (7:117) that "Xerxes was in stature the tallest of all the Persians, falling short by only four fingers of being five royal cubits in height." A royal cubit is assumed to be a bit more than 20 English inches (52 cm), which makes Xerxes almost 8 feet tall (2.43 m), though this is likely legendary. Sancho VII of Navarre was reported to be 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m).


=== Shortest ===
President Benito Juárez of Mexico was reportedly the shortest world leader, standing at 4 ft 6 in (1.37 m).
The shortest monarch is Queen Victoria of the British Empire, who was believed to be around 4 ft 9 in (1.45 m). Two Egyptian pharaohs were also said to be very short, Cleopatra VII was said to be 5 ft 0 in (1.52 m) and Amenhotep I is claimed to be the shortest male monarch at 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m).


== Lifespan after abdication/resignation ==
The monarch with the longest post-lifespan after abdication is Simeon II of Bulgaria who ruled as Tsar of Bulgaria between 1943 and 1946 and is still living, it has been 79 years, 82 days since his reign ended. The president with the longest post-lifespan after resignation is Isabel Perón, President of Argentina who ruled between 1974 and 1976 and is still living, it has been 49 years, 257 days since her resignation.
