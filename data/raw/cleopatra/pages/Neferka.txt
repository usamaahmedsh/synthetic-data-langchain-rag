Neferka (fl. c. 2200 BC) may have been an ancient Egyptian king of the Sixth Dynasty.
A king with the name Neferka, written in the papyrus as Neferka-khered appears in the Turin King List between king Netjerkare Siptah and a king Nefer. Neferka and Nefer are most likely writing errors in the papyrus. Several scholars regard Neferka as mistake for "Neferkare" and identify him with Neferkare Pepiseneb. Other identify him with Menkare.
