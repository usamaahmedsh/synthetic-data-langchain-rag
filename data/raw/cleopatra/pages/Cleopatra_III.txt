Cleopatra III (Ancient Greek: Κλεοπάτρα; c.160–101 BC) was a queen of Egypt. She ruled at first with her mother Cleopatra II and husband Ptolemy VIII from 142 to 131 BC and again from 127 to 116 BC. She then ruled with her sons Ptolemy IX and Ptolemy X from 116 to 101 BC.
Cleopatra III was also known as Cleopatra Euergetis (Εὐεργέτις) while associated with her husband Ptolemy VIII or her son Ptolemy X. She is attested as Cleopatra Philometor Soteira (Φιλομήτωρ Σώτειρα) while associated with her eldest son Ptolemy IX. According to Strabo, she was sometimes known as Kokke (Κόκκη) when discussed in relation to her son Ptolemy X.

Cleopatra III's parents retook the throne and remained in power for almost 20 years until 145 BC. Cleopatra III was born between 160 and 155 BC. She was a sister to Ptolemy Eupator, Cleopatra Thea, Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator, and possibly Berenice.
