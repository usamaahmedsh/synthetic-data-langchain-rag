When Cotys II died in 131, Rhoemetalces succeeded him as king. The relationship between Rhoemetalces and previous kings is not known, though it is possible that he was a son of Cotys II. Rhoemetalces ruled as Bosporan king from 131 until 153. He was a contemporary to the rule of the Roman Emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. On coinage, his royal title is in Greek: ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΡΟΙΜΗΤΑΛΚΟΥ ("of King Rhoemetalces").
According to the Historia Augusta, at an unknown date in the reign of Antoninus Pius, Rhoemetalces travelled to Rome for a hearing of a dispute between him and the imperial commissioner. The nature and causes leading to this dispute are unknown. After the hearing had concluded, the Emperor sent him back to the Bosporan Kingdom. 
Rhoemetalces appears to have been religious and involved in the worship of Aphrodite. This can be confirmed by an inscription found on a statue base from Phanagoria.
