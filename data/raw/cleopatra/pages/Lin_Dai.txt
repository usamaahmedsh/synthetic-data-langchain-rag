Linda Lin Dai (Chinese: 林黛; 26 December 1934 – 17 July 1964), born Ching Yuetyue (程月如), was a Chinese actress of Hong Kong films made in Mandarin during the 1950s–60s. She was a star actress of the Shaw Brothers Studio. She was the daughter of Chinese politician Cheng Siyuan.
Lin Dai was awarded the Best Actress at the Asia Pacific Film Festival four times for her performances in films produced by Shaw Studio. While she attended short courses on drama and linguistics at Columbia University, New York, in 1958, she met and fell in love with Lung Shun Shing (龍繩勳), the son of Long Yun who was a former governor of China's Yunnan province. They married on 12 February 1961 in Hong Kong.
She committed suicide at home in Hong Kong in July 1964, using an overdose of sleeping pills and inhalation of methane gas, due to family matters referred to by the media as "trivial". Her death shocked the Chinese community. She left behind two unfinished films, The Lotus Lamp and Blue And Black (I and II).
