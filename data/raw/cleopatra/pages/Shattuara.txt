Shattuara, also spelled Šattuara, was a king of the Hurrian kingdom of Mittani c. 1305-1285 BC.
Mitanni under the Hittites focused on the northern Khabur region, while the Assyrians focused on the middle Euphrates region with Hanigalbat.


== Reign ==


=== Assyrian period ===
Adad-Nirari I: Shattuara became a vassal of the Assyrian king Adad-nirari I in 1263 BC, after the latter defeated him. In an inscription made by Adad-nirari I, he is said to have rebelled against his lord, but was captured and his oath of loyalty was renewed.
Shalmaneser I: A later king also called Shattuara is suggested to have ruled Hanigalbat during the reign of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser I (1263-1233 BC). In an Assyrian inscription, King Shattuara of Hanigalbat is said to have waged war against Shalmaneser I. However, it seems more likely this event is a recapitulation of the revolt against Adad-nirari I, either by Shattuara or his son Wasashatta.
