Rhescuporis IV (Greek: Τιβέριος Ἰούλιος Ῥησκούπορις Δ', flourished 3rd century – died 234) was a Roman client king of the Bosporan Kingdom. Like many other late Bosporan kings, Rhescuporis IV is known only from coinage, which means his relationship to the other kings is unknown, as are details of his accession and reign. His coins are known from the period 233–234, meaning that he appears to have co-ruled with Cotys III (r. 228–234).
