== Story ==
"Kaisarion" takes place in the study of the poet, where he reminisces of the physicalities and youthfulness of this historical figure. The poet dives into the lost tragic history of the eldest son of Cleopatra. The abundance of information lost over time about Kaisarion made Cavafy's imagination run wild as this prince was a mystery to most people. He is seen as almost reminiscing about a boy who he felt he knew his whole life. The poet creates an image of what this young boy would look like from the way he spoke to the subtle way he moved and behaved.
This poem has underlying lonely as well as melancholic tones as the poet refers to his untimely and quick death, at the age of 17.
