== Early life and career ==
Hồ Ngọc Hà was born in An Cựu, Huế City of Thừa Thiên Huế Province (currently named Thuận Hóa District of Huế Municipality), but later moved to Quảng Bình Province with her parents. Her parents worked in banking. When she was 12 years old, she lived apart from family, as she was enrolled as a piano major at Military Art and Culture College, and lived in a campus dormitory. At the age of 15, instead of continuing in school, she chose to pursue modelling. She went on to earn runner-up position at Ha Noi Supermodel, the first prize at Vietnam Supermodel, and the runner-up position at Asia’s Model Searching competition. In 2003, after moving to Ho Chi Minh City, she made an appearance as a singer for the first time at Người Đẹp Hát show. Afterwards, songwriter Quoc Bao invited her to take part in a song on his upcoming album. After receiving praise and favorable reviews from Người Đẹp Hát show and songwriter Quoc Bao, she decided to pursue singing.


=== 2001: Career debut ===
In 2001, Hồ Ngọc Hà was chosen by director Luu Trong Ninh to portray a character in the TV drama Hoa Co May, which was aired on the Saturday Cinema Show on VTV3 at the time. Her on-screen debut was portraying Huong, an American-Vietnamese girl with a tough personality. At that time, she was studying music as a piano major at the Military Art and Culture College in Vietnam. 
In 2005, after the release of 39 Độ Yêu (39 Degree of Love) and Chiến Dịch Trái Tim Bên Phải (Right-heart Campaign), she temporarily stopped acting to focus on her singing career.


=== 2004: Debut album 24 Hours 7 Days ===
Hồ Ngọc Hà went to Hanoi and met with musician Huy Tuan to discuss working together on her debut album. After that, Huy Tuan began working on her album as a producer. The album was named Vietnamese: 24 Giờ 7 Ngày (24 Hours 7 Days), and was released in 2004 by Viet Tan Studio. The songs in the album were produced and composed by Tuan and numerous songwriters including Duc Tri, Nguyen Xinh Xo, Hong Kien, Duong Thu, An Hieu. The titular single attracted fans, however, the album did not garner further attention. 


=== 2005: Và Em Đã Yêu and Acting Career. ===
Hồ Ngọc Hà signed a record deal with songwriter Duc Tri's Music Faces Records. They then worked together for her second album following Huy Tuan's advice. Her next album title was Và Em Đã Yêu (And I'm In Love), released in June 2005 by Music Faces Records and Phuong Nam Films. There were 5 songs in the album composed by Phuong Uyen, Ho Quang Minh and Duc Tri, and the 5 other songs were her old songs remixed. Two hit songs of the album were Đêm Nghe Tiếng Mưa (Listening to Night Rain) and Và Em Đã Yêu (And I'm In Love).
After the release of her second album, Hồ Ngọc Hà came back to acting in the TV drama version of 39 Độ Yêu (39 Degree of Love), consisting of 16 episodes, an adaptation of a Vietnamese movie of the same name. The drama was criticised by audiences. VnExpress said the movie was a "messy magic show" with "terrible cut from the original". Later, she joined the movie title Chiến Dịch Trái Tim Bên Phải (Right Heart Campaign) released on 10 June 2005. On the contrary to 39 Độ Yêu (39 Degree of Love), this movie gained positive reviews from the audiences. Hoai Nam from Tuoi Tre Newspaper wrote a list of "5 reasons that you should watch Right Heart Campaign".


=== 2006: Muốn Nói Với Anh and Ảo Ảnh ===
Before running her tour in the US, Hồ Ngọc Hà and other artists together worked on her third album named Muốn Nói Với Anh (I Wanna Tell You). The album was released on 15 December 2006 by Music Faces Records and Galaxy Studio in Vietnam and later on iTunes in the US on 19 December 2016 by Music Faces Records. Huy Tuan and Duc Tri co wrote the album, while Ho Ngoc Ha wrote the head single herself and two old songs added from last two albums. There were 3 hit songs in this album: Muốn Nói Với Anh (I Wanna Tell You), Giấc Mơ Chỉ Là Giấc Mơ (Dream Is Only Dream) and Đời Bỗng Vui (Life Is Unexpectedly Happy).
During that time, Ho Ngoc Ha and Duc Tuan released an album named Ảo Ảnh (Illusion), which was a collection of classic songs from famous musicians such as Y Van, Van Phung, Ngo Thuy Mien, Pham Manh Cuong, Do Le, Trong Khuong and Huynh Anh. The album was released in Vietnam by Music Faces Records and in the US on 9 October 2006 by Music Published and Pops Worldwide.


=== 2007-2009: Khi Ta Yêu Nhau, The First Single and Và Em Đã Yêu Tour ===
In 2007, Hồ Ngọc Hà recorded her next album Khi Ta Yêu Nhau (When We're In Love) released by Music Faces Records. However, the album was not widely advertised and promoted and did not perform well commercially. Also in that year, on Sức Sống Mới Show, host Thanh Mai and Trung Dung interviewed Hồ Ngọc Hà on her love and career. However, it was said by a source that she had already broken up with Duc Tri for 1 year already. This created confusion, and she officially made an announcement regarding the rumor: "Right now, I'm being at the peaceful stage of my life. Lots of people are curious of why I look so happy though I've had gone through a break up recently. But it's my real feeling. I love with all of my heart therefore once I break up, I regret nothing". Years after the official break up, she continued working and collaborating with Music Faces Records.
In 2009, she released the album The First Single after a two-year hiatus. This time, Duc Tri was not a part of the album's production, but many young musicians such as Duong Khac Linh, Hoang Anh and Hung Lan were instead. Many copies were sold and the album received plenty of positive reviews from the audience. Xin Hãy Thứ Tha (My Apology) featuring rapper Suboi is considered one of the best songs of her career. She performed the English version of Xin Hãy Thứ Tha named My Apology at Asia Song Festival in Korea.
At that time, she became brand ambassador of Sunsilk Vietnam. In order to promote Sunsilk and her album, she ran the Và Em Đã Yêu Tour across Vietnam starting in September 2009. Tickets were sold by exchanging Sunsilk shampoo bottles for tickets. The tour was from 27 September 2009 in Ho Chi Minh City to 10 October 2009 in Can Tho, and included performances from many guest artists such as Dam Vinh Hung, Dan Truong, Phan Dinh Tung, Quang Vinh, Pham Anh Khoa, Cao Thai Son, Lam Truong and Nguyen Vu. The Và Em Đã Yêu show was aired live on HTV7 and Sunsilk's official website.
She has also been the brand ambassador of Sunplay, Toshiba, Sony Ericsson, and Sunsilk, as well as a music ambassador for YanTV.


=== 2010–early 2011: Motherhood, New album release ===
After giving birth, she came back with her new album titled Tìm Lại Giấc Mơ (Finding Dreams) in 2010. She recorded the album while pregnant and it was released right after giving birth. This was the first album without Duc Tri's collaboration and also the last album released by Music Faces Records. Duc Tri openly supported her departure and shared his thoughts accordingly, saying, "It's totally normal when she leaves. Personally, the most important thing is what remains between those who stay and those who leave". The album was released in Vietnam on 10 July 2011 and in the US on 21 July 2011 on iTunes. The album included songs written by songwriters Nguyen Hong Thuan, Quoc An, Hoang Anh, Duong Khac Linh and Hoang Huy Long. Thêm Một Lần Vỡ Tan (One More Break Up) was composed and written by Ho Ngoc Ha herself. However, the song was compared by audiences to Kylie Minogue's Red Blooded Woman. Speaking of this incident, she said that two songs were completely different, and that she wasn't responsible for the final production and remix whatsoever.
In the promotion for the new album, she continuously cooperated with Sunsilk to hold a small show Tìm Lại Giấc Mơ in 2010, with same guest artists like the previous show but this time, the V-Music band and Ha Anh Tuan were newly added.
Ho Ngoc Ha and the V-Music band partnered up for their album Ngày Hạnh Phúc (Happy Day) released in August 2010 in Vietnam; on 2 August on iTunes. This was her second duet album and the first song without the production of Duc Tri and Music Faces Records, and her third collaboration with Viet Tan Studio. Nikkon was the sponsor of this album.


=== 2011: Invincible ===
Until mid 2011, she released two new singles Sao Ta Lặng Im (Why We Keep Silence), written and composed by Nguyen Hong Thuan, and Nỗi Nhớ Đầy Vơi (Nonstop Missing), featuring Noo Phuoc Thinh, which both made remarkable moves on various music charts. Shortly afterward, the ballad single Một Lần Cuối Thôi (Last Time) was released as an opening for her sixth album Invincible – Sẽ Mãi Bên Nhau (Forever Together) which was scheduled to be released at the end of 2011. This album was a collaboration between her, Duong Khac Linh and Thanh Bui, significantly focused on R&B. The album's master was done in Studio Syd (Australia) by Lenon Zervos (this studio has previously worked with Lady Gaga, Kanye West, and U2.). The head single Invincible was filmed in Hollywood Studio, USA which was her most invested music video of all times. The plot of the music video was conceived by Hồ Ngọc Hà herself, in which she portrayed an alien coming back to Earth in order to rescue her lover from the enemy. Danny Do directed the music video. Critics claimed this music video resembled Katy Perry's ET. The second single Từ Ngày Anh Đi (The Day You Went Away), composed by Nguyen Hoang Duy, was exclusively aired on YanTV. The director was the award-winning Tran Dinh Hien. In this video she portrayed Egyptian Queen Cleopatra, the first time this appeared in Vietnamese music industry.

Runaway was also attached in the single, which is the English version of the song Mãi Mãi Về Sau.
She shared her thought about this single, saying: "Life is colorful and youth is dreamy, however when you grow up, simplicity is the most important thing in life. With this single, I want to present that simplicity with foremost depth within. From music video to CD design, which should be touching towards everyone. Hopefully the audience will have chance to discover themselves, get to know new things, who knows if they could find themselves in my songs. Don't walk in the same path of emotions and music genres".
Đắn Đo (Wondering) was chosen to be the head single. Before the release, Ha and her team kept revealing sneak peeks of the song, which made it appear on top search. However, the audience was somewhat disappointed once it was officially released, due to its rhythm and lyrics. Ha herself claimed that Đắn Đo (Wondering) is not a catchy song and it needs time. She shared: "Lots of people wonder why I've chosen difficult paths this time, instead of the same old style; personally thinking, being safe in music is boring".
