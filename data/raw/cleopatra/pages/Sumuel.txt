Sumuel or Sumu-El (𒋢𒈬𒀭, su-mu-el3) ruled the ancient Near East city-state
of Larsa from c. 1895-1866 BC (MC). He was an Amorite.
Annals for his complete 29-year reign have survived; thus it is known that he campaigned against Akusum and Kazallu in his year 4, Uruk in year 5, Pinaratim in year 8, Sabum in year 10, Kish in year 11, Kazallu in year 15, Nanna-Isha in 16, and Umma at the end of his reign. Most of these seem to be names of small villages along the Euphrates.
Sumuel is known from several inscriptions.
