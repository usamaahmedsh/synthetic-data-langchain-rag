== Biography ==
Watt was born in 1977, the daughter of Jim, a boxing world lightweight champion, and Margaret Watt.  When Watt was 18 years old, in 1995, she and her family suffered the loss of her brother, Jim, one year her junior, in a car accident.
In 2008, Watt became one of the hosts of "60 Minute Makeover" on ITV.
On 24 June 2015, Watt committed suicide. She was experiencing pain following a surgical procedure. Watt had been suffering from headaches and blackouts when she visited an eye doctor for tests in 2014; after being told she needed to go to a hospital immediately, she was given CAT scans and MRI tests, which showed she had calcium deposits on her optical nerve. A lumbar puncture operation was performed to discover the root of her medical condition, a procedure her father later disclosed that she had done despite the Watts' supposed knowledge that actor George Clooney had been suicidal after having one performed on him.
