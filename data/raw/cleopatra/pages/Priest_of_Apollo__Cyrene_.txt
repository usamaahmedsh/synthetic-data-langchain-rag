The priest of Apollo (Ancient Greek: ἱαρεὺς τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος, romanized: hiareus tou Apollōnos) was the chief priesthood of Ancient Cyrene from the fifth century BC until the third century AD.
The priesthood was held for one year. According to the constitution of Cyrene issued by Ptolemy I in 322 BC, the priest had to be chosen from among the 101 members of the council of elders and had to be over the age of fifty. The priesthood was a highly symbolic role, acting as the chief representative of the city to the gods. The office was highly sought after by members of the Cyrenaean elite.
The priest was required to host several public banquets and carry out sacrifices at his own expense. The priest was the city's eponymous official, meaning that his name was used to date all civic documents produced during his year in office. Some priests also carried out building work within the sanctuary of Apollo. After his year in office the priest became a kind of "elder statesman" with privileged rights to attend various banquets and sacrifices.
