Tata (also written as: Ta-a-ar, Tari/ip, Tari, and/or Taar) was the second king of the Awan dynasty and may have been the second to exercise the kingship of Awan over all of Elam. He probably reigned sometime in the first Paleo-Elamite period (c. 2400 – c. 2015 BC). Additionally; he could have possibly been the same second king from Awan said on the Sumerian King List (SKL) to exercise the kingship over all of Sumer. According to the SKL: he was preceded by an unnamed king of Awan (possibly Peli) and succeeded by Kur-Ishshak. However, the Susanian Dynastic List states that he was succeeded by Ukku-Tanhish and preceded by Peli.
