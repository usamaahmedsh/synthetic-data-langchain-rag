The Triplets (Catalan: Les tres bessones; Spanish: Las tres mellizas) are three fictional characters (Anna, Teresa and Helena) created by Catalan illustrator Roser Capdevila.
The Triplets were created in 1983, based on Capdevila's own daughters, three actual triplets born in 1969. The stories were immediately successful and began publishing in many countries. In 1985 a new character, the "Bored Witch" (La Bruixa Avorrida, in Catalan) was added to the plots to form a collection of classical stories, "The Triplets and (...)".
In 1994, television producer Cromosoma and the Catalan TV corporation Televisió de Catalunya adapted the stories to make an animated series based on the books. It became very successful and profitable and led to the production of a second series with the Bored Witch as the main character, together with France 3, Canal J and Storimages., The show was also the first program aired on Télétoon.
By 2004, The Triplets series consisted of 104 episodes, while The Bored Witch reached 52. They have been translated from Catalan to 35 different languages and have been shown in 158 countries or territories. A spin-off series was also made, titled The Baby Triplets.
In October 2020, it was announced that the series would receive a reboot. The reboot will be released in 2027. 


== Plot ==
The plots of the triplet sisters follow a definite pattern. Sometimes they play some prank or manage to annoy the Bored Witch, and, to punish them, she sends them into a classic tale, legend, or children's or adult's (such as Frankenstein or The Phantom of the Opera) literary work. The main structure of the classic remains, but some twists (often hilarious anachronisms such as showing The forty thieves getting distracted from robbing a house by a camel race on TV or Dr. Frankenstein as a veterinarian) are introduced to favor each plot and define the sisters' personalities.


== Characters ==
Tessa (Teresa in original Spanish) - She wears the pink ribbon. She is the most adventurous triplet and comes up with the most ambitious ideas, but she's not necessarily the leader.
Annie (Anna in original Spanish) - She wears the blue ribbon. She's laid-back and more peaceful than her sisters. She's also quite curious. Annie tends to be a bit romantic at times.
Nellie (Helena in original Spanish) - She wears the green ribbon. She has the sweetest demeanor of the triplets. She also has a love for food and sweets, which sometimes leads to trouble.
The Bored Witch - She is an overweight witch who is always bored, despite having great magical powers. She serves as a kind of unofficial day sitter for the triplets, but when they start acting disorderly, she uses her magic to send the girls into stories. No matter what, she never uses magic to directly hinder the girls in their adventures, although tends to join forces with every story's antagonist. Despite her role of antagonist, she is not an evil character and always keeps her word to return the girls to their land.
