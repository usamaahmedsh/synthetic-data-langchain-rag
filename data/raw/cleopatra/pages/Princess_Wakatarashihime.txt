Princess Wakatarashihime (稚足姫 皇女; Wakatarashi-hime) was a Japanese princess and Saiō of Ise Jingū Grand Shrine. Her father was Emperor Yūryaku and her mother was Katsuragi no Karahime.


== Life ==
Born to Emperor Yūryaku, and a consort named Katsuragi no Karahime, Wakatarashihime became Saiō in 456.  However three years into her tenureship as Saiō, Ae no Kunimi accused a man named Takehito, who was a son of Iokibe no Kikoyu, of having sex (possibly raping) with the princess and impregnating her. The saiō was supposed to remain a virgin and unmarried, and breaking this could cost a woman the title. For example, in 578 Princess Uji, daughter of Emperor Bidatsu, lost the title less than a year into her job after being raped, thus no longer being a virgin. The princess pleaded her innocence, and took out a sacred mirror, and recited a poem; At the banks of the Isuzu River, she went to pay her respects, sought out a place where no one walked, buried the mirror, and died.


== Death ==
Following her poem, the Princess soon went missing, and the Emperor had people search for her. The princess had left for Isuzu River, and committed suicide. The princess's mirror was found buried near Isuzu River, and soon after the princess's body was found. Her body was soon cut open, where it was found that she had not Infact been pregnant, thus proving her and Takehito's innocence, however by this point Takehito was also dead after being murdered by his father.
