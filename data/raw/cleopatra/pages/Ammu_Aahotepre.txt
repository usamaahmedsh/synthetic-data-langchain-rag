'Ammu Aahotepre was a pharaoh of the 14th Dynasty who ruled over parts of Lower Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. 


== Attestations ==
This king is poorly attested, see Ryholt 1997:364-365 File 14:4. Like other kings of the dynasty, scarab seals are the only surviving evidence for his reign.


=== Scarab seals ===
'Ammu Aahotepre has 61 seals bearing his name: 30 for the nomen 'Ammu and 32 for the prenomen Aahotepre. The theory that 'Ammu and Aahotepre refer to the same ruler is not certain.
At Tell el-Ajjul, a scarab bearing the nomen of this king was discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1933.


==== Prenomen Aahotepre ====
Scarab seals from 1x Lachish, 2x Tell el-Ajjul, 1x Canaan (?), 1x Delta (?), 27x Provenance Unknown.


==== Nomen 'Ammu ====
Scarab seals from 2x Tell el-Ajjul, 1x Abydos, 1x Semna, 26x Provenance Unknown.


== Theories ==
His reign is believed to have lasted about 15 years, from 1760 BC until 1745 BC.


=== Identification ===
Ryholt (1997) identified king 'Ammu with Aahotepre in his reconstruction of the Turin canon. Von Beckerath (1964) had previously assigned the prenomen Aahotepre to a pharaoh of the Sixteenth dynasty of Egypt.
