Neferkamin (died c. 2188 BC) may have been an Eighth Dynasty king of ancient Egypt during the First Intermediate Period.
His throne name "Sneferka" is only attested on the Abydos King List (n. 47) although it is possible that here the name is mistyped, and the O34 hieroglyph ("s") in fact is a R22 ("min"), hence "Neferkamin". The correct reading of this king's name is provided, along with the name of Nikare, on a gold plaque now in the British Museum; however, it has been suggested  that this object could be a forgery.
Neferkamin is absent from the Turin canon as a large lacuna in this document affects most kings of the 7th/8th Dynasty. No contemporary document or building with his name has been found.
