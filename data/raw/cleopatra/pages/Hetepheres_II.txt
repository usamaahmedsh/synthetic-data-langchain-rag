Hetepheres II (c. 2590 BC - c. 2500 BC) was a queen of ancient Egypt during the 4th Dynasty.


== Biography ==


=== Birth and family ===
Queen Hetepheres II may have been one of the longest-lived members of the royal family of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, which lasted from c. 2723 to 2563 BC. She was a daughter of Khufu and was either born during the reign of her grandfather Sneferu or during the early years of her father's reign. She was named after her grandmother, Hetepheres I and she had an aunt named Hetepheres A. A fragmentary titulature found in the tomb of Meritites I may indicate that she was the mother of Hetepheres II.

=== Marriages ===
During the reign of Khufu, Hetepheres II married her brother, the Crown Prince Kawab, with whom she had at least 2 children, a daughter named Meresankh III and a son named Mindjedef. After the death of her first husband, she married another of her brothers, Djedefre who later succeeded Khufu as king of Egypt.
She was widowed a second time when Djedefre died.  The marriage of her daughter, Meresankh III, to her late second husband's successor Khafre made Hetepheres II the mother-in-law of the new king. She would later out-live Meresankh III. A mark of her affection for Meresankh III may be seen in the fact that Hetepheres II had her own mastaba in the eastern cemetery of Giza converted into a tomb for her daughter's use. Hetepheres II herself was probably buried in tomb G7350 even though she possessed a joint tomb with her first husband, Kawab (G7110 and 7120 respectively).
While marriage within the royal family was common, multiple marriages to this extent was not. It has been suggested her subsequent marriage to Djedefre was honorary in nature and done in order to maintain her position at court. She never produced an heir to the throne in her second marriage and was never given the title of King's Mother.
Hetepheres finally died early in the reign of Shepseskaf, the son and successor of Menkaura, and had thus witnessed the reigns of at least five and perhaps six (if she was born during the reign of Sneferu) kings of the fourth Dynasty.
