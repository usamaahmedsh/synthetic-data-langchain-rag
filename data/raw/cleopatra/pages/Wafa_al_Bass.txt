Wafa al Bass (Wafa al-Biss, b. 1984) is a Palestinian Arab resident of northern Gaza and student at Al Quds University who was permitted to enter Israel for the purpose of being treated for burns at an Israeli hospital in 2005 after a gas cooker had blown up while she was making dinner. She wore a suicide bomb vest which she attempted to explode as she crossed into Israel via the Erez Crossing.
Al Bass had been given permission by Israel to enter Israel to receive hospital treatment for severe burns at Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheva. On June 20, 2005, during one of her return visits, guards at the crossing became suspicious given that she was walking awkwardly, and discovered that under her traditional black robes she had strapped a 22-pound bomb to her legs. She unsuccessfully attempted to then detonate the bomb, and when questioned, she said that she hoped to explode the bomb after arriving at the hospital where she had been treated. She said "I am a member of Al Aqsa Brigades .. I believe in death."
She was sentenced for 12 years, but was released early in the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange.
Upon release from prison she immediately attained further notoriety by urging Gazans to "take another Shalit" every year until all convicted Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons were freed. As schoolchildren gathered at her home in northern Gaza to welcome her home, she told them, "I hope you will walk the same path we took and God willing, we will see some of you as martyrs."
