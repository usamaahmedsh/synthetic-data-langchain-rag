Dynasty 0, or Dynasty Zero of ancient Egypt, refers to the kings who ruled over part or all of Egyptian territory before the reign of the legendary Menes, founder of the First Dynasty and unifier of Egypt. Menes is often associated with Narmer, although the latter's successor, Hor-Aha, is also proposed. This era, located at the very end of the Predynastic period, corresponds to the Protodynastic period of ancient Egypt, and the final phase of the archaeological period of the Naqada culture, called Naqada III, and sees the rise of Egyptian royalty, first in Upper Egypt with three identified proto-kingdoms, leading, at some point in the period, to Egyptian unification.
In this period, those kings' names were inscribed in the form of serekhs on a variety of surfaces including pottery and tombs. The period was characterized by constant conflict with the people of the Nile Delta, probably for the control of valuable trade routes with the Levant.
The Egyptian rulers of the period, attributed to "Dynasty 0", and may have ruled over some parts of Upper Egypt. They include obscure rulers such as Crocodile, Iry-Hor, Ka, and perhaps by the king Scorpion II, whose name may refer to, or be derived from, the goddess Serket, a special early protector of other deities and the rulers. The period ended with the rise of Narmer, who became the first king of the First Dynasty and the first unifier of Egypt.
