Enannatum I  (Sumerian: 𒂗𒀭𒈾𒁺, EN.AN.NA-tum2 fl. c. 2425 BC), son of Akurgal, succeeded his brother Eannatum as Ensi (ruler, king) of Lagash. During his rule, Umma once more asserted independence under its ensi Ur-Lumma, who attacked Lagash unsuccessfully. After several battles, Enannatum I finally defeated Ur-Lumma. Ur-Lumma was replaced by a priest-king, Il, who also attacked Lagash.
Enannatum had a son named Meannesi, who is known for dedicating a statue for the life of his father and mother. He has two other sons, Lummatur and Entemena, the latter succeeding him to the throne. His wife was named Ashumen.
