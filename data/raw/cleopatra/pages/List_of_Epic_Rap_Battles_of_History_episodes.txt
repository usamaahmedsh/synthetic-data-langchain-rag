== Overview ==


== Episodes ==
Each episode of Epic Rap Battles of History features a rap battle between iconic characters, real or fictional. Typically, the battles start off as a one-on-one contest, although sometimes two teams face off (such as in "Mario Bros. vs. Wright Bros." and "Artists vs. TMNT"), and in "John Wick vs. John Rambo vs. John McClane" three characters faced off from the start. Starting with "Hulk Hogan and Macho Man vs. Kim Jong-il," it has become common for additional rappers to appear after the first two have already performed verses.

=== Flash in the Pan Hip Hop Conflicts of Nowadays (2018–2019) ===
Flash in the Pan Hip Hop Conflicts of Nowadays is a pseudo-spinoff of Epic Rap Battles, created without the complex visual effects and accents normally used for the original series. Instead, Shukoff and Alquist rap together in the same room, over one take. This approach was used for rap battle ideas that the two considered worthy of a rap battle, but not worthy enough to demand a full production. "Ronald McDonald vs. The Burger King" would later go on to earn a fully-produced rap battle in Season 6.


=== Season 6 (2019–2020) ===


=== Cancelled episode (2020) ===


=== Season 7 (2021–present) ===
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, ERB chose to transition into a seventh season early rather than continuing Season 6.
