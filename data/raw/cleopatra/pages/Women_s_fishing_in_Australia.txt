In a 1936 fishing derby, there were more male participants than female participants. Women's fishing was being covered by Australian newspapers during the 1930s. The Adelaide Advertiser cited Cleopatra as a reason Australian women should fish, and discussed how one Australian woman has caught more fish than her husband. In 1940, a study of 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done. Most of the women in the study were middle class, conservative, Protestant and white. The study found that 183 participated in sport.  The ninth most popular sport that these women participated in was fishing, with 3 having played the sport.  The sport was tied with croquet, billiards, chess, fishing, field hockey, horse racing, squash, table tennis and shooting. In 1952, there was a women only fishing derby in Sydney.
