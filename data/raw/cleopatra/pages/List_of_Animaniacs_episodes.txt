Several VHS videos were released in the United States in the United Kingdom and Australia.  The British and Australian VHS tapes were put in "volumes", which were generally jumbled at random and are in no particular order with the series.  The U.S. videotapes, however, (with the exception of Animaniacs Stew) feature episodes that had focused on one general subject. Each video featured four to five skits each and was accompanied by a handful of skit intros, with a running time of about 45 to 55 minutes.

=== DVD ===
Volume 1 of Animaniacs had sold very well; over half of the product being sold in the first week made it one of the fastest-selling animation DVD sets that Warner Home Video ever put out. All 99 episodes are available in four DVD boxed sets, although only Volume 1 has been released outside of Region 1. On October 2, 2018, a Complete Series DVD boxed set featuring all 99 episodes and Wakko's Wish, was released.
