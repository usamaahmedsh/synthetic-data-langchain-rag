In Greek mythology, Hyria (Ancient Greek: Ὑρίη) or Hyrie, also called Thyria or Thyrie (Ancient Greek: Θυρίη, romanized: Thurie) was the Aetolian daughter of Amphinomus and mother, by Apollo, of Cycnus.


== Mythology ==
Hyrie grieved much for her son's death, not knowing he had been transformed into a swan; so she melted away in tears or, as others say, threw herself into a lake (Hyria) and was herself turned into a swan.
