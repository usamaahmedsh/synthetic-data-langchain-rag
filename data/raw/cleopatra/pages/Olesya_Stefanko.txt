During the final question and answer portion of the competition Stefanko was asked a question and read by judge Miss Universe 2003 Amelia Vega of the Dominican Republic: "If you could trade lives with anyone in history, who would it be and why?", Stefanko replied:

”I simply live my life and I’m very satisfied with it. But if I did have the chance to trade positions with someone I think I would choose Cleopatra. I think she is a very powerful and strong woman who is very much worthy of respect. And I think a woman could also be a leader like Cleopatra.”
