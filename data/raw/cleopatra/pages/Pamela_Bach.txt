Bach met David Hasselhoff on the set of the Knight Rider episode "Knight Racer" in 1985. They married in December 1989.  The couple had two daughters: Taylor Ann Hasselhoff, born May 5, 1990, who attended the University of Arizona and was cast for the 2015 season of Rich Kids of Beverly Hills, and actress Hayley Hasselhoff, born August 26, 1992.
