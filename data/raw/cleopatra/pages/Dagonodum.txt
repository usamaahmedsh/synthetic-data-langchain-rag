Dagonodum is an extinct genus of ziphiid cetacean known from Tortonian age marine deposits in the Gram Formation in Denmark. There is only one known species, Dagonodum mojnum.


== Etymology ==
The genus name is a reference to the god Dagon, worshiped as the head god and as a deity of prosperity in ancient inland Syria, but best known from H.P. Lovecraft's short story, where he is instead depicted as deep-sea deity. The species name is a reference to the word for "goodbye" in the local South Jutlandic dialect where the fossils were found. The word, "mojn", is of German origin, where it is used as both a greeting and a farewell.


== Taxonomy ==
The species is distinguished by its two pairs of mandibular tusks and long snout. It also possessed a long neck, leading to speculation that it wasn't well suited to deep-dives.


== Feeding ==
The species is notable for its difference from other ziphiidae of the period in that it seems to be less reliant on suction feeding.
