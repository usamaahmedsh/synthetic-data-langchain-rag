Heliocles I (Ancient Greek: Ἡλιοκλῆς, romanized: Hēlioklês, meaning "glory of Helios"; reigned c. 145–120 BC) was a Greco-Bactrian king, a son and successor of Eucratides the Great, and considered the last Greek king to reign over the Bactrian country. His reign was a troubled one; according to Roman historian Justin, Eucratides was murdered crossing the Hindu Kush by one of his sons, although this is highly disputed and Justin fails to name the perpetrator. Eucratides’ death led to instability, even civil war, which caused the Indian parts of the empire to be lost to Indo-Greek king Menander I and southern Bactria to be lost to the Yuezhi.


== Yuezhi invasion ==
From 130 BC a nomadic people, the Yuezhi, started to invade Bactria from the north and we could assume that Heliocles was likely killed in battle during this invasion. Details from Chinese sources seem to indicate that the nomad invasion did not end civilisation in Bactria entirely. Hellenised cities continued to exist for some time, and the well-organised agricultural systems were not demolished.
The Yuezhi would copy and adapt the coin types of Heliocles I for a long time after the latter's death.
Heliocles I used the Greek epithet Dikaios ("the Just") on his coins. There is evidence that Heliocles I ruled around the same time as Eucratides II, as a silver coin has been discovered showing both rulers sharing the coin in a joint issue.
