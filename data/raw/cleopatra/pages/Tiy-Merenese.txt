She is the only known wife of Setnakhte. She was depicted together with her husband on a stela in Abydos. A priest named Meresyotef is shown adoring Setnakhte and Tiy-Merenese and their son Ramesses III is shown making offerings. Tiye-Merenese also appears on blocks found in Abydos which were reused in other buildings.
