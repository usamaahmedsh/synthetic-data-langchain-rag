Nedjeftet (fl. c. 2310 BC) is a queen mentioned on reliefs discovered near the pyramid complex of Pepi I (close to the pyramid complex of Queen Inenek-Inti). She may have been a wife of Pepi. Her name was also that of the 20th nome, later known as the Herakleopolis nome, in Upper Egypt; it is possible her family came from there and the marriage was to strengthen a king's position as opposed to the local lords.
