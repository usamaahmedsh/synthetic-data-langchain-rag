== Plot ==


=== Seasons 1–6 (and live episodes) ===
When his Time and Space Travel Device is stolen by the evil mastermind Dr. Steve and his sock-shaped assistant Fidgert. Dr. Floyd, his young protégé Dr. Grant and their faithful robot companion C.H.I.P.S. must do what they can to get it back. Bent on achieving fame and fortune, Dr. Steve plans to race through history, stealing historical items and then returning to the future to sell them on eBay. Can Dr. Floyd and his crew thwart the evil machinations of Dr. Steve and Fidgert?
In almost every episode the cast visits a famous historical figure.
At the end of Season 6, Dr. Grant passed his "Protégé 101" test (with a score of 98%) and thus tested out of protégé classification (and therefore must leave Dr. Floyd); C.H.I.P.S.' parents are in dire trouble and C.H.I.P.S must help them without Dr. Floyd's help (because bringing humans to C.H.I.P.S.' planet is forbidden and would get C.H.I.P.S. into big trouble); and Dr. Steve returns the Time and Space Travel Device to Dr. Floyd (because Dr. Floyd has stopped him every time he has used it for personal gain.)


=== Season 7 ===
At the start of Season 7, Dr. Steve (and later Dr. Floyd) go down to the Saddle River City Library to do some book browsing. The Librarian asks if there is some Doctor Convention in town, mainly because there have been so many doctors coming to the library. Dr. Floyd heads to the classical literature section placed in the basement of the Library. He finds Dr. Steve trying to find a book on 'the life and times of Berry Malaho'. Dr. Floyd then gives Dr. Steve a lesson on the Dewey Decimal System and then says he's in the wrong area as the classical literature is in the 800's. As Dr. Floyd shows him to the right section of the Library, they are stopped by three Doctors in different coats who are named collectively 'The Literati'. Their goal is to 'bring about the total destruction and complete annihilation of Dr. Floyd!' The Literati invented the Translitora which "looks somewhat like a laser cannon", but was built to destroy Dr. Floyd.
Dr. Steve however says that there can only be one person against Dr. Floyd- himself. Dr. Steve pushes the button on the Translitora, its effect grabbing both Dr. Floyd and Dr. Steve. In a flash Dr. Floyd and Dr. Steve both vanish. The Literati are thrilled that they have now gotten rid of Dr. Floyd. However, Dr. Floyd finds that he and Dr. Steve are now stuck in the stories of Classic literature with the remote control.
In every episode in Season 7, the cast visits a famous classical novel/book.
The final two episodes of Season 7 try to wrap up this Season by sending Dr. Grant and CHIPS back to Dr. Floyd's Lab, (with mini episodes only found on by members of the show, e.g. The Imagination Nations Rangers/Members and eventually getting Dr. Steve and Dr. Floyd out of Classical Literature. Eventually Fidgert steals the Time and Space Travel Device and Dr. Floyd, Dr. Grant and CHIPS are again trying to chase Dr. Steve and Fidgert.


=== Season 8 ===
This season begins with Dr. Floyd and company fleeing from Dr. Steve throughout time and space, until Dr. Steve ultimately corners them. He then shoots Dr. Floyd with a mysterious weapon, causing Dr. Floyd to permanently disappear.
The rest of the season covers the events leading up to this season.
