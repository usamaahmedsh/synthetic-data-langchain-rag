The ostracon portrays Senemut, a courtier of Hatshepsut.
It is a figured-ostracon, of portrait type with heads only. The ceramic is made of white limestone, with dimensions of approximately 3 in (0.8 dm) by 7 in (1.8 dm).
The Ostracon of Senemut is currently part of the collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Traditionally, ostraca in Egypt were used for artist's sketchings, cartoons-caricatures, letter documents, school–practice writing, and graffiti.
