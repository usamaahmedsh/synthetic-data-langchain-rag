A natural disaster is a sudden event that causes widespread destruction, major collateral damage, or loss of life, brought about by forces other than the acts of human beings. A natural disaster might be caused by earthquakes, flooding, volcanic eruption, landslide, cyclones, etc. To be classified as a disaster, it must have profound environmental effects or loss of life and frequently causes financial loss.


== Ten deadliest natural disasters by highest estimated death toll excluding epidemics and famines ==
This list takes into account only the highest estimated death toll for each disaster and lists them accordingly. It does not include epidemics and famines. The list also does not include the 1938 Yellow River flood, which was caused by the deliberate destruction of dikes.

=== Avalanche and landslides (landslips) ===


=== Disease outbreaks ===

Death counts are historical totals unless indicated otherwise.
Events in boldface are ongoing.


=== Earthquakes ===


=== Famines ===

Note: Some of these famines may have been caused or partially caused by humans.


=== Floods ===

Note: Some of these floods and landslides may be partially caused by humans – for example, by failure of dams, levees, seawalls or retaining walls.This list does not include the man-made 1938 Yellow River flood caused entirely by a deliberate man-made act (an act of war, destroying dikes). Some of the death tolls below are unverified, see separate lists.


=== Heat waves ===

Note: Measuring the number of deaths caused by a heat wave requires complicated statistical analysis, since heat waves tend to cause large numbers of deaths among people weakened by other conditions. As a result, the number of deaths is only known with any accuracy for heat waves in the modern era in countries with developed healthcare systems.


=== Limnic eruptions ===

Note: Only 2 cases in recorded history.


=== Tornadoes ===


=== Tropical cyclones ===

Note: Earlier versions of this list have included the so-called "Bombay Cyclone of 1882" in tenth position, but this supposed event has been proven to be a hoax.


=== Tsunamis ===

Note: A possible tsunami in 1782 that caused about 40,000 deaths in the Taiwan Strait area may have been of "meteorological" origin (a cyclone).


=== Volcanic eruptions ===


=== Wildfires ===


=== Winter storms ===
