Queen Hyeondeok (Korean: 현덕왕후 권씨; Hanja: 顯德王后 權氏; 17 April 1417 – 10 August 1441), of the Andong Gwon clan, was the primary consort of Crown Prince Yi Hyang. She died giving birth to the future Danjong of Joseon and was posthumously honoured as Queen Hyeondeok (현덕왕후) in 1450, later demoted by Sejo of Joseon after he deposed her son, then restored by Jungjong of Joseon.


== Biography ==
Gwon Sun-im (권순임; 權順任) was born on 17 April 1417 into the Andong Gwon clan to Gwon Jeon and his second wife, Choi Ah-Ji, Lady Choi of the Haeju Choi clan. She was the eldest of 4 younger sisters and 1 younger brother.
Around the age of 12-13, Lady Gwon entered the palace in 1431 alongside two other girls, Lady Jeong of the Dongrae Jeong clan and Lady Hong of the Namyang Hong clan. All were granted Seunghwi (승휘); the 4th junior rank of the crown prince's concubine. She gave birth to a daughter in 1434, but she died before she reached the age of 4 in 1438.
In 1435, Consort Gwon became pregnant again, which drew the jealously of Crown Princess Sun, who had no children and feared that she would be removed in favor of Gwon. She later gave birth to Princess Gyeonghye in 1436. After Crown Princess Sun was banished for sleeping with her maid, Royal Consort Seunghwi was promoted to Yangwon (양원), the 3rd junior rank of concubine.
Soon after though, officials suggested that Kwon be made the next crown princess, as she already had a child, was older than Lady Hong, and her father's government position was high. She was made Crown Princess Gwon late in 1437.
On 9 August 1441, Crown Princess Gwon gave birth to a son named Yi Hong-wi, which was much celebrated, as he was the crown prince's only son. However, Gwon did not recover from the birth and died a day later. She was granted the posthumous title of Crown Princess Consort Hyeondeok (현덕빈; 顯德嬪) and buried at Soreung (昭陵) in Ansan, Gyeonggi. It was said that her death had deeply saddened her husband and father-in-law, as well as those who lived and worked in the palace.


== Posthumous status ==
When Munjong of Joseon ascended the throne, he granted his wife the title of Queen Hyeondeok. Her son later bestowed a full posthumous name during his reign.
In 1456, several years after her brother-in-law Sejo of Joseon had deposed her son as king, Queen Hyeondeok's brother and mother were found guilty of treason and executed. Both the queen and her father were posthumously demoted to commoner status.
Her status was later restored during King Jungjong's reign and her remains were moved to Hyeonreung to be buried alongside Munjong of Joseon.
