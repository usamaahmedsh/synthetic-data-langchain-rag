Tom J. Anderson (born Ahmad Rezaee Mirghaed (Persian: احمد رضایی میرقائد), c. 1975/1976 – 12 November 2011) was an Iranian businessman and the eldest son of Iranian Major General Mohsen Rezaee. 
He defected to the Embassy of the United States, Vienna in 1998, which led to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) bringing him to New York City and granting him political asylum. He then had several interviews with Voice of America, BBC and Radio Israel, voicing his opposition with the Iranian government and activities of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps abroad. 
He returned to Iran in 2005, without being prosecuted.
