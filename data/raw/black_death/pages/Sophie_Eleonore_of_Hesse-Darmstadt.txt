Sophia Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt (7 January 1634 in Darmstadt – 7 October 1663 in Bingenheim, now part of Echzell), was a Landgravine of Hesse-Darmstadt by birth and a Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg by marriage.
She was a daughter of Landgrave George II of Hesse-Darmstadt (1605–1661) from his marriage to Sophia Eleonore (1609–1671), a daughter of Elector John George I of Saxony.


== Life ==
In Darmstadt on 21 April 1650, Sophia Eleonore was married to her cousin, Landgrave William Christoph of Hesse-Homburg (1625–1681). On the occasion of her wedding, her father gave her the district of Castle Bingenheim.  William Christoph preferred Bingenheim to his castle in Homburg, so the family mostly lived in Bingenheim, and William Christoph was sometimes called the Landgrave of Hesse-Bingenheim. Her father had promised that her male descendants would be allowed to keep Bingenheim after her death; however, only two daughters survived their father. This led to a dispute between Hesse-Darmstadt and Hesse-Homburg about the ownership of Bingenheim, which was finally settled by Elisabeth Dorothea, who was acting as regent of Hesse-Darmstadt.
Sophia Eleonore died in Bingenheim following complications in her last childbirth, aged just 29. She had been constantly pregnant during her marriage, giving birth almost once a year, but almost all of her children went on to die in early childhood.
