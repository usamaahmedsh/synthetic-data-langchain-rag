The Scarifyers is an audio adventure and comic book series produced by Bafflegab Productions (formerly Cosmic Hobo Productions) and based on stories written by Simon Barnard and Paul Morris. Set in 1936 and 1937, it originally followed the exploits of DI Lionheart and ghost-story writer Professor Edward Dunning, as played by Nicholas Courtney and Terry Molloy. 
Each adventure is a self-contained story and is released on CD and direct download. The first two stories, "The Nazad Conspiracy" and "The Devil of Denge Marsh", were broadcast on BBC7 in 2007.

His first Scarifyers story, "The Magic Circle", centred on the disappearance of Lionheart, and introduced new lead character Harry Crow, Lionheart's former police colleague. It was released in November 2011 and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2012.
