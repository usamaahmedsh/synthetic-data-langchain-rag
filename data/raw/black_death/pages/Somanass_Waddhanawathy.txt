Somanass Waddhanawathy (Thai: โสมนัสวัฒนาวดี; Thai pronunciation: [sǒː.má(ʔ).nát.wát.tʰà(ʔ).nāː.wá(ʔ).diː]; RTGS: Somanat Watthanawadi; 1834–1852) was the first consort of Mongkut, the King of Siam, and the queen consort, though for only nine months.


== Life ==
Princess Somanass was a daughter of Prince Lakkhananukhun (son of Nangklao) and Ngiu Suvarnadat. Since her father, as a son of the king and of a royal concubine, was Phra Ong Chao (second-rank prince), Somanass was destined to be Mom Chao (third-rank princess). However, King Nangklao (Rama III) who was her grandfather, specially granted her the title of Phra Ong Chao (second-rank princess). 
In 1851, upon his coronation, Mongkut married Princess Somanass, making her the queen. In 1852, she gave birth to a prince, Somdet Chaofa Somanass, but he died shortly after he was born; Queen Somanass herself died two months later.
