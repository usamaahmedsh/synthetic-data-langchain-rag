Motoric cognitive risk (MCR) is a syndrome that has been defined as a pre-dementia state. It is characterized by a measurable slow walking speed and self-reported cognitive complaints in the absence of significant functional impairment or dementia. The cognitive impairment is less than what would typically be detected on standard cognitive testing. The syndrome was first introduced by J. Verghese et al. in 2013.
MCR has been shown to reliably identify individuals at high risk. MCR has potential for early identification and prevention of dementia.


== Diagnosis ==
In the context of MCR, slow gait speed is defined as being one standard deviation below the age and sex-matched average for that population. Self-reported cognitive complaints have been measured differently in various studies.
