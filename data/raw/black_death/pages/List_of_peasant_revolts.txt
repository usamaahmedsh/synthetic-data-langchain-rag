This is a chronological list of revolts organized by peasants.


== Background ==

The history of peasant wars spans over two thousand years.  A variety of factors fueled the emergence of the peasant revolt phenomenon, including:

Tax resistance
Social inequality
Religious war
National liberation
Resistance against serfdom
Land reform
External factors such as plague and famine
Later peasant revolts such as the Telangana Rebellion were also influenced by agrarian socialist ideologies such as Maoism.
The majority of peasant rebellions ended prematurely and were unsuccessful. Peasants suffered from limited funding and lacked the training and organisational capabilities of professional armies.
