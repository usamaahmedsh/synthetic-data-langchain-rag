The  Nicholson–Bailey model was developed in the 1930s to describe the population dynamics of a coupled host-parasitoid system.a It is named after Alexander John Nicholson and Victor Albert Bailey. Host-parasite and prey-predator systems can also be represented with the Nicholson-Bailey model. The model is closely related to the Lotka–Volterra model, which describes the dynamics of antagonistic populations (preys and predators) using differential equations.
The model uses (discrete time) difference equations to describe the population growth of host-parasite populations. The model assumes that parasitoids search for hosts at random, and that both parasitoids and hosts are assumed to be distributed in a non-contiguous ("clumped") fashion in the environment. In its original form, the model does not allow for stable coexistence. Subsequent refinements of the model, notably adding density dependence on several terms, allowed this coexistence  to happen.

=== Derivation ===
The model is defined in discrete time. It is usually expressed as

=== Variations ===
Density dependence can be added to the model, by assuming that the growth rate of the host decreases at high abundances. The equation for the parasitoid is unchanged, and the equation for the host is modified:

The host rate of increase k is replaced by r, which becomes negative when the host population density reaches K.
