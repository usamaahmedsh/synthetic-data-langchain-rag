Irish cream (Irish: uachtar na hÉireann, uachtar Éireannach) is a cream liqueur based on Irish whiskey, cream and other flavourings. It typically has an alcohol by volume (ABV) level of 15 to 20% and is served on its own or in mixed drinks, most commonly mixed with coffee or in shots such as the B-52 or the Baby Guinness. Its largest markets are the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.


== Etymology ==
Despite its name, it is not a traditional Irish product, as the first version of it, Baileys, was invented in 1973 by British businessman Tom Jago in London, in response to a marketing brief from Gilbeys of Ireland (a division of International Distillers & Vintners). Nevertheless, within the European Union, Irish cream is a protected geographical indication product that must be produced in Ireland.


== Brands ==
Top brands of Irish cream include Baileys, Five Farms, Kerrygold, Merrys, Carolans, Saint Brendan's, and Two Stacks Double Irish Cream Liqueur. The largest manufacturer is Diageo.


== Use ==
Irish cream is served straight, on the rocks or in mixed drinks, often layered in a shot glass with Kahlúa and Grand Marnier to make a B-52 (cocktail) shot, a Baby Guinness, or mixed with coffee or hot chocolate. It is also a common addition to White Russians. Some use Irish cream to flavour desserts and other sweet treats.
