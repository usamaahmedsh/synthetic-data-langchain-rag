Capital punishment in Abkhazia is only permitted for crimes during wartime, although the country is considered to be abolitionist in practice. Since 2007, a moratorium on the death penalty had been in place. In prior years, Abkhazia sentenced ten people to death for various offenses, but none of those sentences were carried out.
