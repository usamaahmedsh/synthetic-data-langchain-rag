Clemence of Hungary, the second wife of Louis X of France and mother of John I of France.
It is believed that Clemence died in 1293, in relation to the birth of her youngest daughter and namesake, Clemence. Others argue that she died in 1295, months after Charles Martel. She is buried in Naples.


== Queen of Hungary? ==
Charles Martel was set up by Pope Nicholas IV and the ecclesiastical party as the titular King of Hungary (1290–1295) as successor of his maternal uncle, the childless Ladislaus IV of Hungary against whom the Pope had already earlier declared a crusade.
He never managed to govern the Kingdom of Hungary, where an agnate of the Árpád dynasty, his cousin Andrew III of Hungary actually ruled that period. Charles Martel was, however, successful in asserting his claims in parts of Croatia, a kingdom then in personal union with Hungary.
Charles Martel died young in Naples, during the lifetime of his parents. Charles Martel and Clemence's son, Charles would ultimately succeed where he had failed in winning the throne of Hungary.
