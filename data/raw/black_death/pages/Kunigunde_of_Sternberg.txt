Kunigunde's parents were the Bohemian nobles Smil of Sternberg (d. 1431) and Barbara of Pardubice (d. 1433). In 1441 she married the 21-year-old George of Poděbrady, who had been captain of the old Bohemian circle of Stará Boleslav since 1440. This marriage produced three sons:

Boček (1442–1496)
Victor (1443–1500) and
Henry the Elder (1448–1498)
and three daughters:

Barbara (1446–1474), married first with Henry of Lipé (Jindřich z Lipé, d. 1469), and second with Jan Křinecký of Ronov
Catherine (1449–1464), married Matthias, King of Hungary; and
Zdenka (1449–1510) (also known as Sidonie of Poděbrady; Catherine's twin)
In 1444 Kunigunde founded a hospital in Poděbrady. It was named after her and remained in operation until the beginning of the 20th century. She also established a foundation for youth education, school construction and rehabilitation of prisoners.
She died in 1449, the day after her twenty-fourth birthday and 9 days after giving birth to twin daughters. She was buried in the parish church Exaltation of the Holy Cross in Poděbrady.
