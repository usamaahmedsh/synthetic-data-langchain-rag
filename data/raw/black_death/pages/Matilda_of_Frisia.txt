Matilda and Henry were married in 1034 after the premature death of his fiancée Matilda of Franconia, who was the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II and Gisela of Swabia. Matilda of Frisia was herself Emperor Conrad II's step granddaughter.
Around 1040, Matilda of Frisia gave birth to a daughter via Caesarian section, but four years later in 1044 both she and her daughter died only weeks apart. Matilda was buried in St Denis Abbey, but her tomb is not preserved.
Henry married Anne of Kiev after Matilda of Frisia's death.
