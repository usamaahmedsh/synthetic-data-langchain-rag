Along Came Daffy is a 1947 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Friz Freleng and written by Michael Maltese and Tedd Pierce. The cartoon was released on June 14, 1947, and stars Daffy Duck and Yosemite Sam.


== Plot ==
Yosemite Sam and his black-haired twin (along with an emaciated mouse) are snowbound in a cabin with no food; starving, they begin to hallucinate, appearing to one other as a roast turkey and a Dagwood sandwich. Their frenzy is interrupted by the arrival of door-to-door salesman Daffy Duck, selling cookbooks. Intent on making the duck their meal, the two famished brothers relentlessly chase Daffy throughout the cabin, eventually catch him and throw him into the oven. To save himself, Daffy then offers them a complimentary six-course turkey dinner, which he produces from his sample case before hastily departing. However, just as Sam and his brother prepare to indulge, a swarm of mice emerges from the wall, and swiftly devours the feast.
A moment later, Daffy returns to the cabin, this time offering after-dinner mints. Still starving, the brothers seize Daffy and slam the door shut, prompting the duck to open it and tell the audience "Well, here we go again!" before being pulled back inside.


== Production notes ==
Along Came Daffy is one of only two Warner Bros. shorts (the other being Honey's Money from 1962), where Yosemite Sam is not paired with his usual antagonist, Bugs Bunny. Along Came Daffy features a scene where Daffy briefly mimics Bugs by chewing a carrot and uttering Bugs's iconic catchphrase, "What's up, Doc?" This narrative structure revisits the theme of two characters endeavoring to consume Daffy, originally depicted in Daffy's Southern Exposure (1942).
