Amalie married Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach (later Mindaugas II of Lithuania), eldest son of Wilhelm, 1st Duke of Urach and his second wife Princess Florestine of Monaco, on 4 July 1892 in Tegernsee, Kingdom of Bavaria. They had nine children:

Princess Marie Gabriele of Urach (1893–1908)
Princess Elisabeth of Urach (23 August 1894 – 13 October 1962) who married Prince Karl Aloys of Liechtenstein (1878–1955), an uncle of Franz Joseph II of Liechtenstein, and had issue.
Princess Karola of Urach (1896–1980)
Prince Wilhelm of Urach (27 September 1897 – 8 August 1957), who morganatically married Elisabeth Theurer (1899–1988) and had two daughters, Elisabeth and Marie Christine, neither of whom married.
Karl Gero, Duke of Urach (19 August 1899 – 15 August 1981), 3rd Duke, who married Countess Gabriele of Waldburg of Zeil and Trauchburg (1910–2005). No issue.

Prince Albrecht of Urach (18 October 1903 – 11 December 1969). First marriage to Rosemary Blackadder, and second to Ute Waldschmidt. He divorced both of them and had children by both. His daughter Marie-Gabrielle (aka Mariga) was the first wife of Desmond Guinness, a diplomat and artist turned journalist and expert on the Far East. His marriages were also considered morganatic, but his descendants can claim titles that pass in the eldest female line.
Prince Eberhard of Urach (1907–1969), who married Princess Iniga of Thurn and Taxis (1925–2008) and had issue; including Karl Anselm and Wilhelm Albert, the current and 5th Duke of Urach. While a notional pretender to the crown of Lithuania, he has not made a formal public claim. Eberhard's descendants inherit the dukedom on the basis of the Salic law principle of Agnatic primogeniture
Princess Mechtilde of Urach (1912–2001), who married Friedrich Karl, Prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst and had issue.
Amalie died at Stuttgart, Kingdom of Württemberg, on 26 May 1912, aged 46, following the birth of her ninth child.
