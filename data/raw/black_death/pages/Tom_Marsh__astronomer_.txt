Thomas Richard Marsh (1961–2022) was a British astronomer and astrophysicist. His research topics included the accretion and evolution of binary star systems. He was awarded the Herschel Medal in 2018 for his development of doppler tomography which he used to study compact binary stars.  


== International and public engagement ==
Marsh worked to bring astronomy to less affluent countries and maintained a strong link with Thailand. This enabled astronomers there to use his high-speed cameras and be part of these international endeavours. He also worked with amateur astronomers, and one of his high-profile papers resulted from an initial observation by an amateur astronomer that he followed up.
He went missing on 16 September 2022 while hiking during an observing visit to La Silla Observatory in Chile, and his body was found in the Atacama Desert on 10 November 2022.
