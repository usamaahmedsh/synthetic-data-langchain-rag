Mary de Bohun (c. 1369/70 – 4 June 1394) was the first wife of Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Northampton, who after her death became King Henry IV. As she died before her husband came to the throne, Mary was never queen. She and Henry had six children together, including the future Henry V.


== Early life ==
Mary was a daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford and Joan FitzAlan, a daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel, and Eleanor of Lancaster.
Mary and her elder sister, Eleanor de Bohun, were the heiresses of their father's substantial possessions. Eleanor became the wife of Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, the youngest child of Edward III. In an effort to keep the entire inheritance for himself and his wife, Thomas of Woodstock pressured the child Mary into becoming a nun. In a plot with John of Gaunt, Mary's aunt took her from Thomas' castle at Pleshey in Essex back to Arundel, whereupon she was married to Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV of England.


== Marriage and children ==
Mary married Henry—then known as Bolingbroke—on 5 February 1381, at Arundel Castle. It was at Monmouth Castle in Wales, one of her husband's possessions, that Mary gave birth to her first child, the future Henry V, on 16 September 1386. Her second child, Thomas, was born probably at London shortly before 25 November 1387.
Her children were:

Henry V, King of England (1386–1422)
Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence (1387–1421)
John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford (1389–1435)
Humphrey of Lancaster, Duke of Gloucester (1390–1447)
Blanche of England (1392–1409) married in 1402 Louis III, Elector Palatine
Philippa of England (1394–1430) married in 1406 Eric of Pomerania, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden


== Death ==
Mary de Bohun died at Peterborough Castle, giving birth to her daughter Philippa. She was buried in the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, Leicester, on 6 July 1394.
