== Biography ==

Victoria was born as the only daughter to Ferdinand, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry and Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya. Her mother was the daughter and heiress of Ferenc József, Prince Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya. When Antonia's father died in 1826, she inherited his estates in Slovakia and Hungary. Victoria's elder brother was King Ferdinand II of Portugal and first cousins included British Queen Victoria, her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as well as Belgian King Leopold II and his sister, Empress Carlota of Mexico.
On 27 April 1840, at the Château de Saint-Cloud, she married Louis d'Orléans, known since birth as the Duke of Nemours, second son of King Louis Philippe of France. After the Revolution of 1848 in France, the royal family went into exile and settled in England. In England Victoria spent a lot of time with her cousin, Queen Victoria, with whom she was extraordinarily close, and she was a frequent guest at Osbourne House.

The Duke and Duchess of Nemours had four children, all of them having issue except the last, Blanche, who never married. Victoria was outlived by her husband, who died in 1896.
In late 1857, Victoria died after giving birth to her daughter Blanche at Claremont and was buried at the Chapel of Saint Charles Borromeo in Weybridge. Queen Victoria wrote of this tragedy: "It seems too dreadful almost to believe it, – too hard to bear". Her remains were transferred to the Royal Chapel of Dreux, the traditional burial place of the House of Orléans, in 1979.
