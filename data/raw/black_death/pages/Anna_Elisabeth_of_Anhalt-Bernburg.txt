Anna Elisabeth of Anhalt-Bernburg (19 March 1647 in Bernburg – 3 September 1680 in Bernstadt, now Bierutów), was a princess of Anhalt-Bernburg by birth and by marriage Duchess of Württemberg-Bernstadt.


== Life ==
Anna Elisabeth was a daughter of Prince Christian II of Anhalt-Bernburg (1599–1656) and his wife Eleonore Sophie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg (1603–1675), a daughter of the duke John II of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg. She married Duke Christian Ulrich I, Duke of Württemberg-Oels on 13 March 1672, in Bernstadt. They had seven children in just eight years of which only two survived infancy.
The duchess was well educated, musically gifted, and a talented singer. She spoke several languages fluently and played numerous musical instruments. She had considerable influence on her husband and advised him in matters of state.
Anna Elisabeth died after complications from her last childbirth on 3 September 1680. She had been constantly pregnant during her nine years of marriage, giving birth almost once a year. Her death plunged Christian Ulrich into deep mourning. He wrote some poems in memory of his wife and lived as a widower for three years before remarrying despite the fact that he had no surviving male heirs at that time.
