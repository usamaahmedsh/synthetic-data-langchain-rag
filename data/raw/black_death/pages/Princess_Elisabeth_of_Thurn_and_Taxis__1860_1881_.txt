Elisabeth was a Princess of Thurn and Taxis by birth and married Miguel Januário, Duke of Braganza, the Miguelist claimant to the throne of Portugal from 1866 to 1920.

== Marriage and issue ==

Elisabeth married Miguel Januário, Duke of Braganza, son of Miguel I of Portugal and his wife Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, on 17 October 1877 in Regensburg, Kingdom of Bavaria.
Elisabeth and Miguel had three children:

Dom Miguel Maria Maximiliano de Bragança, Duke of Viseu (1878–1923), married Anita Stewart
Dom Francisco José de Bragança (1879–1919)
Dona Maria Teresa de Bragança (1881–1945), married Prince Karl Ludwig of Thurn and Taxis
The couple moved to Austria, where on 22 September 1878 in Reichenau an der Rax, her first son, Miguel Maria Maximiliano, was born. It was after this birth that Elisabeth's health began to deteriorate. Elisabeth died at the age of 20 in Ödenburg shortly after the birth of her third child, Maria Teresa.
Elisabeth's mother Helene withdrew more and more from public life after her death. Elisabeth's husband Miguel Januário eventually remarried on 8 November 1893 in Kleinheubach to Princess Maria Theresa of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg.
