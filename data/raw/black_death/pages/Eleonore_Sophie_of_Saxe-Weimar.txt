== Life ==
In Weimar on 9 July 1684 Eleonore Sophie married Prince Philipp of Saxe-Merseburg, third surviving son of Duke Christian I. Shortly after the wedding, he received the town of Lauchstädt as his appanage, and took his residence there.
The marriage produced two children, neither of whom survived to adulthood:

Christiana Ernestina (Merseburg, 16 September 1685 – Merseburg, 20 June 1689).
John William, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Merseburg-Lauchstädt (Lauchstädt, 27 January 1687 – Merseburg, 21 June 1687).
Eleonore Sophie died in Lauchstädt aged 26, eight days after the birth of her son, probably from childbirth complications. She was buried in Merseburg Cathedral.
