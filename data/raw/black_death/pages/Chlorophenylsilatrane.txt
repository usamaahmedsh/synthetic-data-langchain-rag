1-(4-Chlorophenyl)silatrane is an extremely toxic organosilicon compound which was developed by M&T Chemicals as a single-dose rodenticide. It was never registered as rodenticide, except for experimental use. 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)silatrane was one of the chemicals studied in the Project Coast.


== Toxicity ==
1-(4-Chlorophenyl)silatrane is a GABA receptor antagonist and it destroys nervous functions in the central nervous system of vertebrates, primarily in the brain and possibly in the brain stem. It's a rapid acting convulsant, causing convulsions within 1 minute in mice and rats. Death occurred within 5 minutes. It is therefore likely to induce poison shyness. In field trials, it was less effective than zinc phosphide against wild rats.
