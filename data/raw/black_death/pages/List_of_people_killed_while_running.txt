People running for exercise are murdered for a variety of reasons across the globe. Given that the majority of victims of such attacks are women, such attacks influence women's decisions to engage in physical activity. A 2023 study commissioned by Asics found environmental barriers such as the lack of safe spaces and a fear of harassment were preventing women from engaging in exercise.
People, primarily female, often report being harassed while running for exercise primarily by men. In a 2023 study commissioned by Adidas, 92% of women in nine countries reported being concerned for their safety while running. Likewise, a 2024 study from the University of Manchester found two-thirds of women in the UK experienced some form of abuse while running.
Many of the harassment incidents and physical attacks happen during daylight hours. In one nine-day period in 2016, three women were murdered while they were running, drawing wider attention to this phenomenon.
While the list below focuses on people murdered while running for exercise, there are a greater number of attacks against runners that did not result in murder. For example, from December 1977 to February 1980, San Francisco Police Department statistics indicate 15 rapes and attempted rapes against joggers occurred in Golden Gate Park alone.
This list contains people who were murdered while running for exercise.
