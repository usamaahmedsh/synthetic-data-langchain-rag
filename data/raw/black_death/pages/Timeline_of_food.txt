This is a timeline of human food and food-related cultural habits, as well as those of our closest extinct relatives. The cut-off point for inclusion is the separation of the Hominina from Pan, the genus that includes modern-day chimpanzees.


== Prehistoric times ==
5-2 million years ago: Hominids shift away from the consumption of nuts and berries to begin the consumption of meat.

2.5-1.8 million years ago: The discovery of the use of fire may have created a sense of sharing as a group. Earliest estimate for invention of cooking, by phylogenetic analysis.
250,000 years ago: Earliest uncontroversial archaeological evidence of hearths.
170,000 years ago: Cooked starchy roots and tubers in Africa.

13,000 BCE: Contentious evidence of oldest domesticated rice in Korea. Their 15,000-year age challenges the accepted view that rice cultivation originated in China about 12,000 years ago. These findings were received by academia with strong skepticism, and the results and their publicizing has been cited as being driven by a combination of nationalist and regional interests.

11,500 - 6200 BCE: Genetic evidence published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) shows that all forms of Asian rice, both indica and japonica, spring from a single domestication that occurred 8,200–13,500 years ago in China of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon.
