According to this legend, romanticized by Alexander Pushkin in his celebrated ballad "The Song of the Wise Oleg", it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg of Novgorod (?–912) would take death from his stallion. Proud of his own foretelling abilities, he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy.
