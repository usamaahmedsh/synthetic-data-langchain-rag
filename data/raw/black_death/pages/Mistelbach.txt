== History ==
Early settlements in the Mistelbach area can be traced back to pre-Christian times.
Around 1130, Mistelbach was mentioned in official deeds for the first time. After the Lords of Mistelbach died out around 1370, the royal estates of Wilfersdorf were given to the House of Lichtenstein.
Mistelbach was granted its first right to hold markets in 1372. Today, the town still hosts four markets per year. Mistelbach received its town charter on 5 July 1874.
In the 19th century, Mistelbach was strongly influenced by its connection to the Austrian Eastern Railway. It eventually became the district's capital. In the 20th century, the town experienced difficulties caused by its geographical proximity to the Iron Curtain. Nevertheless, Mistelbach developed into a regional center of the Eastern Winequarter (Weinviertel).
