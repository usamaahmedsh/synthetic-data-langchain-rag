The Minister for Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, is a minister in the Government of New South Wales who has responsibility for the prevention of domestic violence and sexual assault in New South Wales, Australia.
The reduction in violence against women was one of the objectives in establishing the Minister for the Status of Women in the third Fahey ministry in 1993. A separate portfolio of Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault was created in the second Baird ministry. Women's safety was added to the portfolio title in the second Perrottet ministry when Natalie Ward held the portfolio.
With the return of Labor to power at the 2023 election, the portfolio returned to its original title. The current minister, since 5 April 2023, is Jodie Harrison serving in the Minns ministry. The minister supports the Attorney General in the administration of that portfolio through the Department of Communities and Justice and a range of other government agencies. Ultimately, the ministers are responsible to the Parliament of New South Wales.
