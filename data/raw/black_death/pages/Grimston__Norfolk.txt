Grimston is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk.
Grimston is located 5.7 miles (9.2 km) east of King's Lynn and 33 miles (53 km) north-west of Norwich.


== History ==
In 1860, a substantial Roman villa was discovered in Grimston, which was excavated in 1905.
Grimston's name is of mixed Anglo-Saxon and Viking origin and derives from an amalgamation of the Old English and Old Norse for Grimr's farm or settlement.
In the Domesday Book, Grimston is recorded as a settlement of 142 households in the hundred of Freebridge. In 1086, the village was divided between the estates of Bishop Odo of Bayeux, William de Warenne, Roger Bigod of Norfolk and Berner the Bowman.
Grimston, and the nearby hamlet of Pott Row, were significant centres of pottery production from the 11th to 16th centuries, and important suppliers of this to Scandinavia.  Grimstonware has been found as far afield as Italy and Spain. Pots often had faces carved just under the rim.  Some of these can be seen in local museums including the Castle Museum, Norwich.
The parish also includes the deserted medieval settlement of Wyveling, which was probably abandoned due to the ravages of the Black Death.
