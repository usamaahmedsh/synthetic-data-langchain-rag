In medicine, an agonal heart rhythm is a variant of asystole. Agonal heart rhythm is usually ventricular in origin.  Occasional P waves and QRS complexes can be seen on the electrocardiogram. The complexes tend to be wide and bizarre in morphological appearance. Clinically, an agonal rhythm is regarded as asystole and should be treated equivalently, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and administration of intravenous adrenaline.
