The 2023 Bloomington, Minnesota municipal election was held on November 7, 2025. Bloomington's mayor was up for election, as well as all six city council seats. Additionally, voters decided three ballot measures concerning the establishment of a local sales tax to fund infrastructure projects. It was the second election to use ranked-choice voting in the city, and voters ranked up to three candidates per city office. City council Districts I, II, and the at-large special election were up for two-year terms, while the mayoral race, city council at-large, and Districts III and IV were up for four-year terms. 
Bloomington's mayor and five city councilmembers were re-elected. In the open District IV race, conservative Victor Rivas was elected, a change from previous unanimously progressive councils.
