Held annually around the United Nations International Day of Democracy, the Athens Democracy Forum was founded in 2012. The mission of the Forum is to bring together diverse voices and perspectives that help democracies evolve and become more resilient in the face of rising inequalities, the rapidly developing climate crisis, adverse democratic shifts, runaway tech innovation and failing multilateral governance.
Key events include the Aristotle Address, the City of Athens Democracy Award, the Kofi Annan NextGen Democracy Prize and the Democratic Innovators of the 21st Century Politicians' Hall of Fame.


== The Democracy & Culture Foundation ==
The Democracy & Culture Foundation was founded in 2019. The Foundation's mission is to help democracy evolve by empowering society through citizen engagement and better governance. It aims to become the leading global platform for dialogue and solution-oriented activities concerning the evolution of democracy and culture. Two of its major events, the Athens Democracy Forum in association with The New York Times and Art for Tomorrow, are held annually and designed to convene, connect and foster collaboration between prominent and emerging voices for both democracy and culture. The Foundation and its partners also run worldwide initiatives including Teens for Democracy, Reimagining the Building Blocks of Democracy, the Climate Change Hub, the Kofi Annan NextGen Democracy Prize, as well as exploring the use of A.I. in deliberative democracy tools.


== History ==
From 2013 to 2018, the Athens Democracy Forum was convened by The New York Times. Since 2019, the event has been organized by the nonprofit Democracy & Culture Foundation. The first Athens Democracy Forum was held around the United Nations International Day of Democracy with the U.N. secretary-general's endorsement, and the Forum continues to partner with the United Nations.

== Building Blocks for Democracy ==
Source:
Following the 2021 Athens Democracy Forum, the Democracy & Culture Foundation initiated a four-year project called “Re-imagining the Building Blocks for Democracy”. The project was launched in response to the calls during the 2021 Forum to establish more specific characteristics that make democracy resilient to 21st century issues. The Democracy & Culture Foundation initially cooperated with five partner organizations, each of which was responsible for a particular “building block”: Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Berlin, Germany (“The power of Parties, Money and Influence”); Taejae Academy in association with Ban Ki-moon Foundation in Seoul, South Korea (“The power of the Executive”); newDemocracy Foundation in Sydney, Australia (“The power of People’); The Bertelsmann Foundation in Washington DC, United States (“The power of Information”); IDEA in association with Sapienship in Tel Aviv, Israel (“The Power of Voting”). It was agreed that the initial five partners will draft policy proposals in local experts’ panels in 2022 (stage 1), subject those proposals to the scrutiny of citizen’s panels in 2023 (stage 2) and campaign for the implementation of those proposals in 2024 (stage 3). In 2023, the Democracy & Culture Foundation partnered with McKinsey and a variety of academics and EU institutions to create two additional building blocks: “The power of Business” and “The power of AI and Ethics,” as well as Foundation for Innovation and Development in Colombia, which took over “The power of Information” building block.
