Parliamentary elections were held in Vietnam on 19 July 1992. The Communist Party of Vietnam was the only party to contest the election, although independent candidates were also allowed, but must be affiliated with the Vietnamese Fatherland Front. Non-affiliated candidates were allowed to run for the first time in this election. While the VFF nominated 599 candidates (almost 90% of which were members of the Communist Party), there were only two independents. The VFF won all 395 seats.
