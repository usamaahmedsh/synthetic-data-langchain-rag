The 1913 South Carolina United States Senate election was held on January 28, 1913, when the South Carolina legislature met and unanimously ratified the results of the August 27, 1912 primary. Incumbent Senator Ben Tillman was re-elected to a fourth term in office.
Prior to the ratification of the 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Senators were elected by the state legislature.  However, the Democratic Party of South Carolina organized primary elections for the U.S. Senate beginning in 1896 and the General Assembly would confirm the choice of the Democratic voters. Tillman handily defeated former U.S. Representative W. Jasper Talbert and businessman Nathaniel B. Dial in the primary election.

W. Jasper Talbert, former U.S. Representative from Parksville
Nathaniel B. Dial, businessman and former Mayor of Laurens


=== Campaign ===
Ben Tillman, a Senator since 1895, drew opposition in the Democratic primary for the first time during his career.  He had long avoided any opposition because of his influence in the Democratic Party in the state, but by 1912 he had moderated his positions and lost the radical edge that had allowed him to build up a hard core following of support.  The radicals in the state electorate had thrown their support to Coleman Livingston Blease in the gubernatorial election of 1910 and the Bleasites were determined to knock his chief opponent, Tillman, out of office.  W. Jasper Talbert emerged as the candidate of the Bleasites and Nathaniel B. Dial entered the race as an alternative to the two.  The voters of the state split their support between the Tillmanite and Bleasite factions as both Tillman and Blease won their respective primaries.
