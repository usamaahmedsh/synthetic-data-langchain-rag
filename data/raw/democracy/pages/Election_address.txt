An election address is the material sent out by a candidate during a political campaign.  Election Addresses are normally only sent out during the election period itself.  Other political leaflets are usually known by different names.
In UK parliamentary elections, all candidates are entitled to have one election address delivered free, by Royal Mail, to every voter in their constituency.
