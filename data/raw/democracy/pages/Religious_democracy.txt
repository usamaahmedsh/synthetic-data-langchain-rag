Religious democracy is a form of democracy where the values of a particular religion or state religion are preferred. The term applies to all democratic countries in which religion is incorporated into the form of government.
Democracies are characterized as secular or religious. The definition of democracy is disputed and interpreted differently amongst politicians and scholars. The religiosity of political leaders can also have an effect on the practice of democracy.
Some argue that religious democracies can be also be liberal democracies, such as religious liberalism.

== Criticism ==
Major criticism of religious democracy include criticism from the secular and the legalist points of view.

From the secular point of view, religion is a hindrance to democracy as it enforces a set of legal and societal principles. Separation of religion and state is required to protect freedom and ensure equality. As many countries, including the United States, incorporate religion into their legislation, it could be argued as to what constitutes a secular democracy.
From the legal point of view, democracy can never enjoy general acceptance in a religious society. Anything outside of rigid interpretation of religious texts is rejected, and God rather than the people is sovereign.
Conversion is a threat to diversity richness of a nation. It installs fear among the people of a particular community as they find their population shrinking due to conversion.
