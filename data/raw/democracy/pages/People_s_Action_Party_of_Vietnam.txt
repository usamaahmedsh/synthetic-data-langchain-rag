Founded in 1991, PAP's goals are to unite the people of Vietnam with a democratic government and reform government programs in education, health care, economy, and human rights.
They established offices in Cambodia, but their officials were arrested and transferred to Vietnam for prosecution. They have actively tried to gain support in Vietnam, but 21 of their supporters were detained by the government without trial for more than two years.
