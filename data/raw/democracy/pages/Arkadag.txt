It is a largely greenfield development started in 2019 with an initial budget of $1.5 billion. The city was named in honor of former president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, father of sitting president Serdar Berdimuhamedow, who is officially entitled Arkadag. Uniquely among Turkmen cities, Arkadag is by law designated a "city of state importance".
