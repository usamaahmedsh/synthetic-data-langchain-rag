Presidential elections were held in El Salvador on 26 January 1852. Francisco Dueñas ran unopposed and was elected by the legislature. He claimed he was elected with the "unanimous vote of the citizenry". This was the first of four occasions during which Dueñas would serve as the Salvadoran president.
