It was created in 2004 and mainly operates in Brussels.


== Purpose ==
HRDN aims at influencing the EU and its Member States's policies and funding instruments to promote democracy, human rights and peace:
‘HRDN’s vision is that human rights and democracy are placed at the heart of the EU's internal and external policy agenda. This vision should manifest itself in an EU which effectively protects human rights at home and is a force for positive change in the world.’


== Activities ==
HRDN members gather once every six weeks in Brussels to exchange information and discuss potential joint advocacy activities, for instance the preparation and publication of common positions and recommendations. Activities are coordinated by a troika, whose representatives are elected among the member organisations during the annual meetings of the network.
To draft common positions or organise joint events, informal working groups are temporarily established. All member organisations of the network can join these working groups. Current policy working groups are focused on the following issues:

the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR)
the European Parliament
