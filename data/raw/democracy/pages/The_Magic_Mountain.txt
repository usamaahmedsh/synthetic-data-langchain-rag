The Magic Mountain (German: Der Zauberberg, pronounced [deːɐ̯ ˈtsaʊbɐˌbɛʁk] ) is a novel by Thomas Mann, first published in Germany in November 1924. Since then, it has been published in many editions and translated across numerous languages.


== Background ==
Mann began writing The Magic Mountain in 1912. He initially intended it to be a novella that would revisit aspects of his earlier work Death in Venice in a more humorous manner. The newer work reflected his experiences and impressions from a period when his wife, who was suffering from a respiratory disease, resided at Dr. Friedrich Jessen's Waldsanatorium in Davos, Switzerland. In numerous (now lost) letters to him, she described everyday life in the sanatorium. During a three-week visit across May and June of 1912, Mann obtained firsthand impressions and became acquainted with the doctors and patients. According to an afterword later included in the English translation of the novel, this stay inspired the opening chapter, "Arrival". 
The beginning of World War I disrupted his work on the book. Like many other Germans, Mann supported the German Empire. During what he described as a state of "sympathy with death", he wrote the essays "Gedanken im Kriege", "Gute Feldpost", and "Friedrich und die große Koalition", examples of an intellectual military service that he regarded as his duty. 
In response to anti-war intellectuals, Mann wrote a book-length essay, Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man, which was published in 1918. However, his position was challenged by other intellectuals, such as his older brother, Heinrich Mann, who, unlike Thomas, did not support the German state. Heinrich was the author of the satirical novel Der Untertan and the essay "Zola", which defended the idea of Germany's inevitable defeat as the path to democratization. The end of the war led Thomas Mann to rethink his position. In 1919, he changed the tone of the novel to reflect the realities of war rather than its romanticized depiction and included conflicts between the characters, drawing from his relationship with Heinrich.  
Mann later took an interest in studying European bourgeois society. He explored the sources of the destructiveness displayed by much of civilized humanity and speculated about questions related to personal attitudes toward life, health, illness, sexuality, and mortality. His political stance during this period shifted from opposition to the Weimar Republic to support for it. Der Zauberberg was eventually published in two volumes by S. Fischer Verlag in Berlin.


== Plot summary ==

The narrative opens in the decade before World War I. It introduces the protagonist, Hans Castorp, the only child of a Hamburg merchant family. Following the early death of his parents, Castorp was raised by his grandfather and later by his great-uncle, Tienappel. Castorp is in his early twenties and is about to take up a shipbuilding career in his hometown of Hamburg. Before beginning work, he undertakes a journey to visit his cousin, Joachim Ziemssen who is seeking a cure for his tuberculosis in a sanatorium in Davos, high in the Swiss Alps. In the opening chapter, Castorp leaves his familiar life and obligations, in what he later calls "the flatlands", to visit the rarefied mountain air and introspective small world of the sanatorium.
Castorp’s plans to leave the sanatorium are repeatedly postponed as his health deteriorates. What at first appears to be a minor bronchial infection with a slight fever is later diagnosed by the sanatorium's chief doctor and director, Hofrat Behrens, as symptoms of tuberculosis. Castorp is persuaded by Behrens to stay until his health improves.
During his extended stay, Castorp meets various characters, representing a microcosm of pre-war Europe. These include Lodovico Settembrini, an Italian humanist, encyclopaedist, and student of Giosuè Carducci; Leo Naphta, a Jewish Jesuit who favors communist totalitarianism; Mynheer Pieter Peeperkorn, a Dionysian Dutchman, and his romantic interest, Madame Clawdia Chauchat.
Castorp eventually remains at the sanatorium for seven years. As the novel concludes, World War I breaks out, and Castorp volunteers for military service. The narrative suggests that he may not survive the battlefield.


== Literary influence and criticism ==
Scholars have variously interpreted The Magic Mountain both as a classic example of the European Bildungsroman – a "novel of education" or "novel of formation" – and as a satire of this genre. Many formal characteristics of the Bildungsroman are present: the protagonist begins in a state of immaturity and, through leaving his home environment, is exposed to art, culture, politics, human vulnerability, and love.
The novel explores themes such as the experience of time, music, nationalism, sociology, and changes in the natural world. Through Castorp's stay in the rarefied atmosphere of "The Magic Mountain", the narrative provides a panoramic view of pre-World War I European civilization and the underlying tensions of the era.
The novel explores the subjective experience of serious illness and the gradual process of medical institutionalization, as well as the irrational forces within the human psyche, reflecting the contemporary rise of Freudian psychoanalysis. These themes relate to the development of Castorp's character over the period covered by the novel. In his discussion of the work, written in English and published in The Atlantic in January 1953, Mann states that "what [Hans] came to understand is that one must go through the deep experience of sickness and death to arrive at a higher sanity and health...".
Mann also acknowledged his debt to the skeptical insights of Friedrich Nietzsche concerning modern humanity, and he drew from these in creating conversations between the characters. Throughout the book, the author employs the discussions among Settembrini, Naphta, and the medical staff to introduce the young Castorp to a wide spectrum of competing ideologies in response to the Age of Enlightenment. While a classical Bildungsroman would conclude with Castorp's having become a mature member of society, with his worldview and greater self-knowledge, The Magic Mountain ends with Castorp's becoming one of millions of anonymous conscripts under fire on a World War I battlefield.


== Major themes ==


=== Connection to Death in Venice ===
Mann wrote that he originally planned The Magic Mountain as a novella, a humorous, ironic, satirical follow-up to Death in Venice, which he had completed in 1912. The atmosphere was derived from the "mixture of death and amusement" that Mann had encountered while visiting his wife in a Swiss sanatorium. He intended to transfer to a comedic plane the fascination with death and triumph of ecstatic disorder over a life devoted to order, which he had explored in Death in Venice.
The atmosphere and the protagonist's trajectory in The Magic Mountain differ from those in the earlier novella. Whereas the protagonist of the novella was the mature and acclaimed author Gustav von Aschenbach, the central figure is now a callow young engineer at the outset of an anticipated career. The alluring Polish adolescent Tadzio in the novella corresponds to the "Asiatic-flabby" ("asiatisch-schlaff") Russian Madame Chauchat. The setting has shifted from the densely populated island city on the Adriatic coast to an alpine, quasi-resort-like sanatorium prized for its (alleged) health-restoring properties.


=== Illness and death ===
The Berghof patients suffer from various forms of tuberculosis, which dictates their daily routines, thoughts, and conversations as members of the "Half-Lung Club" ("Verein Halbe Lunge"). The disease ends fatally for many of the patients, such as the Catholic girl, Barbara Hujus, whose fear of death is heightened in Chapter 3 during a harrowing Viaticum scene, and cousin Ziemssen, who dies like an ancient hero. The dialogues between Settembrini and Naphta examine life and death from a metaphysical perspective. In addition to deaths from illness, two characters commit suicide. Ultimately, Castorp leaves to fight in World War I, where his likely death is implied.
In the above-mentioned comment, Mann writes:

What Castorp learns to fathom is that all higher health must have passed through illness and death... As Hans Castorp once said to Madame Chauchat, there are two ways to life: One is the common, direct, and brave. The other is bad, leading through death, and that is the genius way. This concept of illness and death, as a necessary passage to knowledge, health, and life, makes The Magic Mountain into a novel of initiation. 


=== Time ===
The treatment of time (Zeit) is a major narrative and philosophical concern in the novel. The novel's structure reflects this through its asymmetrical handling of chronology: the first five chapters (approximately half the novel) detail only the initial year of Castorp's stay, while the final two chapters compress the remaining six years. 
Mann addresses time both as a narrative device and a philosophical concept. Chapter VII, titled "By the Ocean of Time," opens with the narrator directly questioning the possibility of narrating time itself. The characters frequently discuss theories of time perception, debating whether time passes more quickly or slowly depending on circumstances and routine.
Contemporary philosophical discussions of time, particularly Henri Bergson's concepts of duration and subjective time experience, informed Mann's approach. This influence is evident in the novel's exploration of how time appears to accelerate or decelerate based on the characters' experiences in the sanatorium setting.
The narrative is ordered chronologically but accelerates throughout the novel such that the first chapters relate Castorp's first year in great detail, while the remaining six years, marked by monotony and routine, are condensed into the final two chapters of the book. This asymmetry corresponds to Castorp's own skewed perception of the passage of time.
This structure reflects the protagonist's thoughts. Throughout the book, the characters discuss the philosophy of time and debate whether "interest and novelty dispel or shorten the content of time, while monotony and emptiness hinder its passage".  The characters also reflect on the problems of narration and time,  about the correspondence between the length of a narrative and the duration of the events it describes.
Mann also meditates upon the interrelationship between the experience of time and space; of time seeming to pass more slowly when one does not move in space. This aspect of the novel mirrors contemporary philosophical and scientific debates which are embodied in Heidegger's writings and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, in which space and time are inseparable. In essence, Castorp's subtly transformed perspective on the "flat-lands" corresponds to a movement in time.


=== Magic and mountains ===

The titular reference to "mountain" reappears in many layers. The Berghof sanatorium is located on a mountain, both geographically and figuratively, a separate world. The mountain also represents the opposite of Castorp's home, the sober, business-like "flatland".
The first part of the novel culminates and ends in the sanatorium Carnival feast. There, in a grotesque scene named after Walpurgis Night, the setting is transformed into the Blocksberg, where according to German tradition, witches and wizards meet in obscene revelry. This is also described in Goethe's Faust I. At this event, Castorp woos Madame Chauchat; their subtle conversation is carried on almost wholly in French.
Another topos of German literature is the Venus Mountain (Venusberg), which is referred to in Richard Wagner's opera Tannhäuser. This mountain is a "hellish paradise", a place of lust and abandon, where time flows differently: the visitor loses all sense of time. Castorp, who planned to stay at the sanatorium for three weeks, does not leave the Berghof for seven years.
In general, the inhabitants of the Berghof spend their days in a mythical, distant atmosphere. The x-ray laboratory in the cellar represents the Hades of Greek mythology, where Medical Director Behrens acts as the judge and punisher Rhadamanthys and Castorp a fleeting visitor, like Odysseus. Behrens compares the cousins to Castor and Pollux; Settembrini compares himself to Prometheus. Frau Stöhr also mentions Sisyphus and Tantalus, albeit confusedly.
The culmination of the second part of the novel is perhaps the – still "episodic" – chapter of Castorp's blizzard dream (in the novel simply called "Snow"). The protagonist finds himself in a sudden blizzard, beginning a death-bound sleep, dreaming at first of beautiful meadows with blossoms and of lovable young people at a southern seaside, then of a scene reminiscent of a grotesque event in Goethe's Faust I ("the witches' kitchen", again in Goethe's "Blocksberg chapter"), and finally ending with a dream of extreme cruelty – the slaughtering of a child by two witches, priests of a classic temple. According to Mann, this represents the original and deathly destructive force of nature itself.
Castorp awakens in due time, escapes from the blizzard, and returns to the Berghof. But rethinking his dreams, he concludes that "because of charity and love, man should never allow death to rule one's thoughts". Castorp soon forgets this sentence, so for him, the blizzard event remains an interlude. This is the only sentence in the novel that Mann highlighted in italics.
There are frequent references to Grimms' Fairy Tales, based on European myths. The opulent meals are compared to the magically self-laying table of "Table, Donkey, and Stick"; Frau Engelhardt's quest to learn the first name of Madame Chauchat mirrors that of the queen in "Rumpelstiltskin". Castorp's given name is the same as "Clever Hans". Although the ending is not explicit, it is possible that Castorp dies on the battlefield. Mann leaves his fate unresolved.
Mann makes use of the number seven, often believed to have magical qualities: Castorp was seven when his parents died, he stays seven years at the Berghof, from the years 1907 to 1914, the central Walpurgis Night scene happens after seven months, both cousins have seven letters in their last name, the dining hall has seven tables, Madame Chauchat is initially assigned room number 7, the digits of Castorp's room number (34) add up to seven, and Joachim's room is a multiple of seven (28=7×4), Settembrini's name includes 'seven' (sette) in Italian, Joachim keeps a thermometer in his mouth for seven minutes, and Mynheer Peeperkorn announces his suicide in a group of seven, Joachim decides to leave after a stay of seven times seventy days and dies at seven o'clock. The novel itself, moreover, is divided into seven chapters.


=== Music ===
Mann gives a central role to music in this novel. People at the Berghof listen to "Der Lindenbaum" from the Winterreise played on a gramophone. This piece is full of mourning in the view of death and hints at an invitation to suicide. In the book's final scene, Castorp, now an ordinary soldier on Germany's western front in World War I, hums the song to himself as his unit advances in battle.


=== Allegorical characters ===
Mann uses the novel's main characters to introduce Castorp to the ideas and ideologies of his time. The author observed that the characters are all "exponents, representatives, and messengers of intellectual districts, principles, and worlds," and hoped that he had not made them mere wandering allegories.


==== Castorp ====

According to Mann, the protagonist is a questing knight, the "pure fool" looking for the Holy Grail in the tradition of Parzival. The character is often interpreted as representing the German bourgeoisie of the era, exposed to and torn between the conflicting influences of humanism, philistinism, and radical ideologies. 
As usual, Mann chooses his protagonist's name carefully: 'Hans' is a generic German first name, almost anonymous, but also refers to the fairy tale figure of "Hans im Glück" and the apostle St. John (Johannes in German), the favorite disciple of Jesus, who beholds the Revelation (Offenbarung des Johannes in German). Castorp is the name of a historically prominent family in Mann's hometown, Lübeck, which provided at least three generations of Mayors for the town in the era of the Renaissance. The "torp" is Danish, not unexpected on the German north coast. Castorp also refers to the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology, who were identified by the New Testament scholar Dennis MacDonald as models for the apostles James and John.
In a way, Hans Castorp can be seen as the incorporation of the young Weimar Republic. Humanism and radicalism, represented by Settembrini and Naphta, try to win his favour, but Castorp is unable to decide. His body temperature is a subtle metaphor for his lack of clarity: Following Schiller’s theory of fever, Castorp’s temperature is 37.6 °C (99.7 °F), which is neither healthy nor ill, but an intermediate point. Furthermore, the outside temperature in Castorp's residence is out of balance: it is either too warm or too cold and tends to extremes (e.g., snow in August), but never normal.
The most pronounced instance of Thomas Mann's political conversion is in the "Schnee" (snow) chapter. Completed in June 1923, this chapter, which forms the philosophical heart of the novel, attempts to overcome apparent contrasts and find a compromise between Naphta's and Settembrini's positions. In the chapter "Humaniora", written three years prior, Castorp tells Behrens, in a discussion on medical matters, that an interest in life means an interest in death. In the "Schnee" chapter, Castorp comes to exactly the opposite conclusion. 
The basis for Castorp's contradiction can be found in the speech "On the German Republic" (Von Deutscher Republic), written in the previous year, in which Mann outlines his position with regards to the precedence of life and humanity over death. Even though Castorp could not possibly have learned from either Naphta or Settembrini the idea that the experience of death is ultimately that of life and leads to a new appreciation of humanity, Mann was determined from at least September 1922 onwards to make this message the main point of his novel. 
In a letter of 4 September 1922 to Arthur Schnitzler, Mann refers to "Von deutscher Republik", in which, he says, he is endeavoring to win the German middle classes over to the cause of the Republic and humanitarian concerns, and adds that his new-found passion for humanitarianism is closely related to the novel on which he is working. In the climax of the "Schnee" chapter, Castorp's vision is of the triumph of life, love, and human concern over sickness and death. This realization corresponds closely to Mann's key observation in "Von deutscher Republik". As if to dispel any lingering doubts, Mann makes the meaning absolutely clear in his "Tischrede in Amsterdam" [Dinner speech in Amsterdam], held on 3 May 1924. Death stands for the ultra-conservative opponents of the Republic, while life embodies the supporters of democracy, the only way to guarantee a humanitarian future. 
The "Schnee" chapter was written in the first half of 1923 and the italicization of the key sentence was probably requested by Mann when the book was set in print in 1924, as a message to the readers of the time, who, after years of hyper-inflation and political turmoil, not only expected but also desperately needed a positive direction to their lives, some words of wisdom which would give them hope.


==== Settembrini: Humanism ====

Settembrini articulates the ideals of The Enlightenment, of Humanism, democracy, tolerance and human rights. He often finds Castorp literally in the dark and switches on the light before their conversations. He compares himself to Prometheus of Greek mythology, who brought fire and enlightenment to Man. His own mentor, Giosuè Carducci, has even written a hymn to another lightbringer: Lucifer, "la forza vindice della ragione." His ethics are grounded in bourgeois values and the virtue of labour. He attempts to steer Castorp away from his preoccupation with death and disease and his attraction to Madame Chauchat, advocating instead for a life-affirming worldview.
His antagonist Naphta describes him as "Zivilisationsliterat", meaning cosmopolitan, un-German intellectuals. Mann originally constructed Settembrini as a caricature of the liberal-democratic novelist represented, for example, by his own brother Heinrich Mann. However, while the novel was being written, Mann himself became an outspoken supporter of the Weimar Republic, precipitated by the assassination of then German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau whom Mann deeply admired, which may explain why Settembrini, especially in the later chapters, becomes the "Sprachrohr des Autoren" (the voice of the author).


==== Naphta: Radicalism ====

Settembrini's antagonist Naphta was Jewish but joined the Jesuits and became a Hegelian Marxist. The character was a parody of the philosopher Georg Lukács, who wrote that he "plainly has not recognized himself in Naphta", in a 1949 letter to Mann.
Even here a change in Mann's political stance can be seen. In "Operationes spirituales" from Chapter VI, written towards the end of 1922, Naphta is termed a "revolutionary" and "socialist", but Settembrini sees Naphta's fantasies as emanating from an anti-humanitarian reactionary revolution ("Revolution des antihumanen Rückschlages"). In this chapter, the terrorism championed by Naphta is no longer, in Castorp's eyes, associated solely with the "Diktatur des Proletariats", but also with conservative Prussian militarism and Jesuitism. The association here between Naphta's advocacy of terrorism and two extremely conservative movements – Prussian militarism and Jesuitism – is a huge political shift for the novel. Terrorism, until now viewed as exclusively the province of the communist revolution, is suddenly also an instrument of reactionary conservatism. In a clear allusion on Mann's part to the assassination of Walther Rathenau, Naphta goes into the motivation of the revolutionary who killed Councillor of State August von Kotzebue in 1819 and concludes that it was not just the desire for freedom at stake, but also moral fanaticism and political outrage. That this is a direct reference to the death of Rathenau is borne out by the fact that in the first edition Mann refers to the shooting of Kotzebue, whereas he was in fact stabbed. Alerted to this mistake by Max Rieger, Mann replied on 1 September 1925 that he would rectify the error at the first opportunity. Mann changed the word geschossen to erstochen for future editions. For the 1924 readership, however, the association with Rathenau could not have been clearer.


==== Chauchat: Love and temptation ====
Clawdia Chauchat is frequently interpreted as embodying erotic temptation and a less disciplined approach to life. The novel's narration describes her with terms such as 'Asiatic-flabby', associating her with a decadent or 'morbid' allure that contrasts with Settembrini's rationalism. She is one of the major reasons for Castorp's extended stay on the magic mountain. The female promise of sensual pleasure as a hindrance to male zest for action imitates the themes from the Circe mythos and in the nymphs in Wagner's Venus Mountain. Chauchat's feline characteristics are noted often, her last name is derived from the French chaud chat [hot cat], and her first name includes the English 'claw'. (Her name may also be a reference to the Chauchat machine gun,
a French weapon that saw significant use by the French and American forces during World War I.) Chauchat could also be a play on words with 'chaud' [hot] and 'chatte' [female genitalia] in French slang.
Clawdia Chauchat leaves the Berghof for some time, but she returns with an impressive companion, Mynheer Peeperkorn, who suffers from a tropical disease.


==== Peeperkorn: The Dionysian principle ====

Mynheer Peeperkorn, Clawdia Chauchat's new lover, enters the Berghof scenery late, but he is one of the most commanding persons in the novel. His behaviour and personality, with its flavour of importance, combined with obvious awkwardness and the strange inability ever to complete a statement, are reminiscent of certain figures in former novellas of the author (e.g., Herr Klöterjahn in Tristan) – figures, which are, on the one hand, admired because of their vital energy and, on the other hand, condemned because of their naïveté. In total, this person represents the grotesqueness of a Dionysian character. The Greek god Dionysus is also important in Nietzschean philosophy, whose The Birth of Tragedy is the source of the title The Magic Mountain.
Peeperkorn ends his life by suicide, also performed in a strange manner.
Mynheer Peeperkorn was used by the author to personify his rival, the influential German poet Gerhart Hauptmann, and even certain aspects of Goethe (with whom Hauptmann often was compared). "One scholar has postulated that the character of Mynheer Peeperkorn... who revels in lavish meals... was intended as a mirror image of Kafka's hunger artist..."


==== Ziemssen: Duty ====
Joachim Ziemssen, Hans Castorp's cousin, is described as a young person representing the ideals of loyalty and faithfulness as an officer. As already mentioned, Dr. Behrens alludes to the pair as "Castor(p) and Pollux", the twin brothers of Greek mythology. And in fact, there is some affinity between the two cousins, both in their love to Russian women (Clawdia Chauchat in the case of Hans Castorp, the female co-patient "Marusja" in the case of Joachim Ziemssen), and also in their ideals. But, in contrast to Hans Castorp, who is an assertive person on the Berghof scene, Joachim Ziemssen is rather shy, known to stand somehow outside of the community. He tries to escape from what he unspokenly feels to be a morbid atmosphere. After long discussions with his cousin, and in spite of being warned by Dr. Behrens, he returns to the "flatlands", where he fulfills his military duties for some time. But after a while he returns to the Berghof, forced by the deterioration of his lungs. It is, however, too late for a successful treatment of his illness, and he dies in the sanatorium. His death is described in a moving chapter of the novel, with the title "As a soldier, and a good one" [(Ich sterbe) als Soldat und brav], again a well-known citation from Goethe's Faust.


== In popular culture ==
The Magic Mountain is mentioned in the film The Wind Rises (2013), directed by Hayao Miyazaki, by a German character named Hans Castorp.
Nobel Laureate Czesław Miłosz borrowed the title for his poem, "A Magic Mountain".
The novel is mentioned in The Dick Van Dyke Show episode "That's My Boy??" (season 3, episode 1). With all the mix-ups at the hospital between the Petries and the Peters, and each getting the other's stuff, Rob is trying to determine if he and Laura brought home the right baby, so he goes to check the baby's footprints, which he tells his neighbour are kept in The Magic Mountain. "Huh?" says Jerry. "The book", says Rob. Jerry finds the footprints and reads the book's title, "Oh, Thomas Mann", and then they cover the kid's foot with blue ink.
The 2016 psychological horror film A Cure for Wellness was inspired by Mann's novel. 
The Empusium: A Health Resort Horror Story, the 2022 novel by Nobel Prize laureate Olga Tokarczuk, is said to be "part homage and part rejoinder" to The Magic Mountain.
