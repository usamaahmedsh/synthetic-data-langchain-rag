The law of Gibraltar is a combination of common law 
and statute, and is based heavily upon English law.
The English Law (Application) Act 1962 stipulates that English common law will apply to Gibraltar unless overridden by Gibraltar law. However, as Gibraltar is a self-governing British overseas territory, it maintains its own independent tax status and its parliament can enact laws independently of the United Kingdom.


== Constitution ==

The Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006 replaced the Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969.


== Legislation ==
The legislature is the Gibraltar Parliament (formerly called the Gibraltar House of Assembly). It replaced the Gibraltar Legislative Council which replaced the Governor-in-Council.
The gazette is the Gibraltar Gazette.
