== Changes in democracy ==
After the fall of Communism most countries in Central and Eastern Europe either democratized or re-democratized. Some democratic backsliding can be observed in parts of Europe, including Hungary and Poland. The V-Dem Democracy Report identified for the year 2023 Montenegro and Kosovo as cases of stand-alone democratization and North Macedonia as a case of U-Turn democratization, while Poland as a small but statistically insignificant uptick in liberal democracy index. Some view European democracies have become more consensual and less majoritarian over time. Increased importance of constitutionalism has been claimed.
