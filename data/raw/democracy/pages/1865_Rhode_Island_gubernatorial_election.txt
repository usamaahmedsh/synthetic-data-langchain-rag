A gubernatorial election was held in Rhode Island on April 5, 1865. The National Union incumbent governor James Y. Smith was re-elected against token opposition.
Smith, a Radical Republican, won the 1863 Rhode Island gubernatorial election and was re-elected in 1864. His nearest opponent was the former state senator Edward Harris, an abolitionist and temperance supporter who ran on the Equal Rights ticket.
