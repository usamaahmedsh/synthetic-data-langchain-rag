A gubernatorial election was held in Virginia on December 5, 1812. The incumbent governor of Virginia James Barbour was re-elected without opposition.
Barbour's tenure coincided with the War of 1812. His administration of the state's affairs met with the broad approval of the public and their representatives, and he faced no challenger for re-election when the legislature convened in late November.
The election was conducted by the Virginia General Assembly in joint session. Barbour was elected with a majority on the first ballot.
