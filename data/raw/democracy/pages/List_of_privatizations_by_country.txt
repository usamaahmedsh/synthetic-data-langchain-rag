== Egypt ==
The Shebin spinning and weaving factory in Menoufia in the Nile Delta was on strike against/locked out by its new non-Egyptian owners in the wake of the 2011 revolution. Workers and maybe the military now in control of the state were favoring re-nationalization, according to one report. "[L] iberal economic policy is tarred with [the old regime's] corruption," said Michael Wahid Hanna, in Cairo for the U.S.-based Century Foundation. Indorama, the new Indonesian/Thai owner of Shebin, was not quoted in the report. Looking further back to 2000, "well considered public spinners" Shebin El Kom and STIA, were then considered to have a "redundant labor problem ... [but] would otherwise be attractive privatization buying or leasing opportunities for private investors." In 2011, STIA, also known as El Nasr Wool & Selected Textiles, of Alexandria, remained "one of the largest public sector textiles companies."
