Green Party Korea (Korean: 녹색당) is a political party in South Korea. The party was established in March 2012. It is a continuation of the Korea Greens, created following initial discussions in 2011. The party was established in response to the Fukushima Nuclear Crisis of Japan. Green Party Korea is a member of the Global Greens and the Asia Pacific Greens Federation.


== History ==
As a result of the party only getting 0.48% in the 19th national parliamentary election in April 2012, the party was disbanded by the National Election Administration Office. However, the paragraph 4 of article 41 and the subparagraph 3 of paragraph 1 of article 44 of the Political Parties Act, which had revoked registration of parties and banned use of the titles of the parties whose obtained numbers of votes had been less than 2% of the total number of effective votes, were ruled unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Korea on 28 January 2014. As a result, Green Party Korea recovered its title.
Green Party Korea, together with the Basic Income Youth Network, began a two-week tour on 6 July 2015 to discover the opinions citizens in South Korea have about basic income, and to introduce the concept of basic income to the community. The party has also adopted basic income as part of their party platform.
The party joined an electoral alliance with social-democratic Justice Party to participate in 2024 South Korean legislative election. Due to South Korean electoral law, which doesn't allow electoral alliances officially, the Justice Party changed its name to the Green Justice Party, and candidates of the Green Party individually joined the Green Justice Party.
Since 2025, the Green Party has been working in solidarity with the Justice Party and Labor Party, creating Korea's version of a left-wing traffic light coalition. The Labor Party announced in early 2025 that they would join the alliance, forming the traffic light coalition. When the impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol triggered a presidential election, the three progressive parties fielded a joint candidate.
