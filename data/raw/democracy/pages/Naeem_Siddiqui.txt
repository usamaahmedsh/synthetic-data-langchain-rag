Maulana Naeem Siddiqui (1916 – 25 September 2002) was a Pakistani Islamic scholar, writer and politician. He was among the founder-members of the Jamaat-e-Islami and a close associate of Abul A'la Maududi and Amin Ahsan Islahi.


== Early life and career ==
Naeem Siddiqui was born on 5 June 1916 at Chakwal, Punjab, British India. He was home-schooled and then from Government High School, Khanpur. He completed Molvi Faazil at Uloom-e-Islamia (institution for Islamic religious sciences) and then got the degrees of "Munshi" (Graduation) and of Munshi Faazil (that was equivalent to master's degree at that time) in Arabic and Persian literature from the University of Punjab, Lahore in 1938. Naeem Siddiqui was among the founder members of Jamaat-e-Islami along with its founder Abul A'la Maududi. However, due to irreconcilable differences with its leadership, he quit Jamaat in 1994 and founded the Islamic religious and political party tehreek e Islami along with his fellows in 1994. In 1996, Tehreek-e-Islami split into two groups, one group was led by Naeem Siddiqui himself while the coordinator of the other group was Hafeez-ur-Rehman Ahsan. Due to the endavour and mediation of some Arab-countries-based Pakistani friends, both groups were re-united in 1998.  He explained the story of the reunion in a letter to his friend Khwaja Maqbool Ellahi in 2001 by saying that our difference was unique and now our union is also unique.
