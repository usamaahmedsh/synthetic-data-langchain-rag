Parliamentary elections were held in Romania on 3 February 1957. Voters were presented with a single slate of candidates from the People's Democratic Front (FDP), which was dominated by the Romanian Workers Party (PMR). The Front won all 437 seats in the Great National Assembly.


== Electoral system ==
Candidates were elected in single member constituencies, and had to receive over 50% of the vote. If no candidate passed this threshold, or if voter turnout in the constituency was less than 50%, re-runs were held until the requirements were met. Candidates could be nominated by the FDP or mass organisations, although the latter were monitored by the Front. Voters had the option of voting against the Front candidates.
