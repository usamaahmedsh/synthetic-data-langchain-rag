The 1932 United States Senate election in Louisiana was held on November 8, 1932.  Incumbent Democratic Senator Edwin Broussard ran for a third term in office, but was defeated in the primary by U.S. Representative John H. Overton.
On September 13, Overton won the Democratic primary with 61.64% of the vote.
At this time, Louisiana was a one-party state (no other party had run a candidate for Senate since the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment), and the Democratic nomination was tantamount to victory. Overton won the November general election without an opponent.
