The Bâtiments du Roi (French pronunciation: [bɑtimɑ̃ dy ʁwa], 'King's Buildings') was a division of the Maison du Roi ('King's Household') in France under the Ancien Régime.  It was responsible for building works at the King's residences in and around Paris.


== History ==
The Bâtiments du Roi was created by Henry IV of France to coordinate the building works at his royal palaces.  Formerly, each palace had its own superintendent of works.  Henry gave the task of supervising all works to Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully.
In the 17th century, the responsibilities of the Bâtiments du Roi extended beyond pure building works, to include the manufacture of tapestries and porcelain.  In 1664, Jean-Baptiste Colbert was entitled surintendant et ordonnateur général des bâtiments, arts, tapisseries et manufactures de France ("superintendent and director-general of building, art, tapestries and factories of France"). This title was retained by several of his successors.  Other areas that came within under the control of the Bâtiments du Roi included botanical gardens, and the Royal Academies of painting and sculpture, and of architecture.
The wide scope of the responsibilities meant that the superintendent of the Bâtiments du Roi was effectively a minister of the French king. The director general was assisted by the first architect to the King (premier architecte du Roi) and the first painter to the King (premier peintre du Roi), a staff of inspectors, architects and several hundred workmen.  Much of the work was left to the director's first lieutenants, such as Robert de Cotte and Gilles-Marie Oppenord.
