Champart (French pronunciation: [ʃɑ̃paʁ]) was a tax in Medieval France levied by landowners on tenants. Paid as a share of the harvest, the amount due varied between 1⁄6
and 1⁄12, and typically 1⁄8 of the cereal crop.
Regional names for champart included arrage, gerbage, parcière, tasque, and terrage.
Beginning in the early modern period, champart was converted into a cash rent, first in the Île-de-France region.
