The Council of the Presidency for the Re-Foundation of the Republic of Madagascar is the acting governing body of Madagascar, established by the Madagascar Armed Forces unit CAPSAT immediately following the 2025 Malagasy coup d'état of 14 October. It is headed by Colonel Michael Randrianirina, who consequently serves as transitional president. Currently comprising officers of the armed forces and the national gendarmerie, the council's first decree noted that civilians were to probably be included as well.


== Background ==


=== Protests and seizure of power ===

After weeks of protests in Madagascar triggered by frequent power and water outages, the Madagascar Armed Forces, led by CAPSAT, began to disobey orders to quell protesters from then-President Andry Rajoelina and urged other members of the armed forces and the gendarmerie to support the protesters. By the morning of 12 October, CAPSAT partially seized the capital Antananarivo with little resistance and declared the seizure of every Armed Forces chain of commands.
After Antananarivo was partially seized and Rajoelina fled to France, General Demosthene Pikulas was appointed as the new chief of staff of the Madagascar Armed Forces. On 14 October, Iavoloha Palace fell to the armed forces and Colonel Michael Randrianirina was named as the country's interim leader shortly after by the High Constitutional Court and made his first presidential instruction to dissolve all national institutions except the National Assembly. On 15 October, Malagasy state television announced that Randrianirina would be inaugurated on 17 October as "President of the Refoundation of the Republic of Madagascar" during a session of the Constitutional Court. He was sworn in on that date as planned.


=== Leadership ===
By the decree of the High Constitutional Court of Madagascar, Colonel Michael Randrianirina was appointed to assume presidential duty and chairmanship of the Council of the Presidency for the Re-Foundation of the Republic of Madagascar for the country's 2 year transitional period before the new presidential election can be commenced by the end of the transitional period.
