The presidency of Francisco Sagasti in Peru started on 17 November 2020 in the midst of a constitutional crisis which resulted in multiple presidential successions to complete the remaining 2020-2021 presidential term. The administration has been deemed as a "Transitional government" and an "Emergency government" in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic recession, and a political crisis which dominated Peruvian life.
