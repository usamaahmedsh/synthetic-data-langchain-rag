Parliamentary elections were held in Vietnam on 20 July 1997. The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) was the only party to contest the election, although independent candidates were also allowed to run, but must be affiliated with the Vietnamese Fatherland Front (VFF), an umbrella organization that is also under the control of the CPV. Non-affiliated candidates were also allowed to run. The VFF won 447 of the 450 seats, of which  the CPV won 382. Voter turnout was reported to be 99.6%.
