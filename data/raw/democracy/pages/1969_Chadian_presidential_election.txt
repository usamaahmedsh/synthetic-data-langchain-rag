Direct presidential elections were held in Chad for the first time on 15 June 1969. Previously the President had been elected by an electoral college, but in an attempt to mobilise support, incumbent François Tombalbaye initiated direct elections. The country was a one-party state at the time, with the Chadian Progressive Party as the sole legal party and Tombalbaye ran unopposed. Voter turnout was 93%.
