A self-coup, also called an autocoup (from Spanish  autogolpe) or coup from the top, is a form of coup d'état in which a political leader, having come to power through legal means, stays in office or increases their power illegally through the actions of themselves or their supporters. The leader may dissolve or render powerless the national legislature and unlawfully assume extraordinary powers. Other measures may include annulling the constitution, suspending civil courts, and having the head of government assume dictatorial powers.
From 1946 to the beginning of 2021, an estimated 148 self-coup attempts took place, 110 in autocracies and 38 in democracies.
