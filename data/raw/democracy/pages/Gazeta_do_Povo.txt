Gazeta do Povo (GP) is a Brazilian newspaper based in Curitiba, Paraná. The newspaper is almost exclusively published in digital format, with a weekly magazine edition on Saturdays. It is currently considered the largest newspaper in Paraná and the oldest newspaper in the state.
After a moderate turn in its political stance, beginning in 2015, the newspaper became an outlet for  Brazilian conservatism.
