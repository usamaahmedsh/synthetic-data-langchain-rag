Presidential elections were held in Argentina on 12 April 1874. Nicolás Avellaneda was declared the winner of the elections. Supporters of rival candidate Bartolomé Mitre rebelled.


== Background ==
President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's pragmatic approach to Buenos Aires' demands and his successful control of separatist revolts in the north paved the way to high office for his vice president, Autonomist Party leader Adolfo Alsina. Alsina gained the support of a sizable faction of Mitre's Nationalist Party, resulting in the formation of the paramount political group in Argentina for the next 42 years: The National Autonomist Party (PAN). Mitre himself did not support Alsina, however, whom he viewed as a veiled Buenos Aires separatist. The elder statesman ran for the presidency again, though the seasoned Alsina outmaneuvered him by fielding Nicolás Avellaneda, a moderate lawyer from remote Tucumán Province. The electoral college met on 12 April 1874, and awarded Mitre only three provinces, including Buenos Aires.
As he had repeatedly up to 1861, Mitre took up arms again. Hoping to prevent Avellaneda's 12 October inaugural, he mutineered a gunboat; he was defeated, however, and only President Avellaneda's commutation spared his life.
