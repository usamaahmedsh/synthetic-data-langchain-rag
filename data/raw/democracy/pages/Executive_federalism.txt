Alternatively, Donald Smiley defined executive federalism as "the relation between elected and appointed officials of the two orders of government."


== Implementation by country ==


=== Australia ===

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, the National Cabinet, consisting of the Prime Minister and the premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories, in order to help guide the country through the crisis. It has been described as akin to Australia's war cabinet during the Second World War. As a special intergovernmental decision-making forum, its power is that which the leaders of all Australian jurisdictions bring to negotiate on behalf of their people, and to implement the decisions reached, a model which public policy expert Jennifer Menzies calls executive federalism. In this model, the citizens of each state or territory are represented by their elected heads, and the smaller states have equal representation


=== Austria ===

The Conference of State Governors (German: Landeshauptleutekonferenz) is an informal – not provided for in the Constitution of Austria – meeting of the nine state governors. Alongside the Federal Council, the Austrian upper house, it is the second most important body for co-operation between the states as well as for federalism in the Austrian political system (in the modern Austria).
The Council of state governors is considered to be "the most powerful governing institution of the federal states" and a motor for strengthening the federal state", the Federal Council itself is regarded as having little influence in Austria.
Its importance is also reflected in the fact that although it has no constitutional basis, numerous legal texts refer to it.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, the most publicized aspect of executive federalism is the First Ministers Conference; however, in the first decade of the 21st century, the Council of the Federation became the important bi-annual meeting between the Premiers of Canada.

=== Germany ===

The Conference of Ministers-President is a committee formed by the sixteen States of Germany (Bundesländer) to coordinate policy in areas that fall within the sole jurisdiction of the Länder, e.g. broadcasting. The conference is not a constitutional body, therefore formal agreements between the federal states are fixed in a Staatsvertrag (treaty/compact). Since the MPK itself is not an official constitutional body, its meetings are purely informal, coordinating in nature. Similar bodies also exist at the level of the specialist ministers (such as the Conference of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs)
The Federal-State Conference (officially: "Conference of the Federal Chancellor with the Heads of Government of the States") is an unofficial body of the Federal Government and the federal states that was convened for the first time on 12 March 2020 to coordinate measures under the Infection Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz, IfSG) to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany nationwide.

The Constitution of India in Article 263, provided that an Inter-State Council (ISC) may be established  "if at any time it appears to the President that the public interests would be served by the establishment of a Council". Therefore, the constitution itself did not establish the ISC, because it was not considered necessary at the time the constitution was being framed, but kept the option for its establishment open. This option was exercised in 1990. Therefore, the ISC was established as a non permanent body (According to the ISC secratariate website)on 28 May 1990 by a presidential order on recommendation of Sarkaria Commission.
The Prime Minister of India and the chief ministers have held meetings, each known as a "Conference of Chief Ministers".
