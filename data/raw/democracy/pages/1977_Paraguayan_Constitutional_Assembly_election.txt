Constitutional Assembly elections were held in Paraguay on 6 February 1977. The Colorado Party was the only party to contest the elections amidst an opposition boycott, and won all seats. Voter turnout was 82.8%. Following the election, the constitution was amended to scrap term limits, allowing President Alfredo Stroessner to contest the 1978 elections.
