The Democratic People's Republic of Angola (Portuguese: República Popular Democrática de Angola), also referred to as Free Angola (Portuguese: Angola Livre) or the Free Land of Angola (Portuguese: Terra Livre de Angola), was a rival government to that of the People's Republic of Angola during the nation's civil war.
It was declared by the FNLA and UNITA in the city of Huambo. It was formed during the dawn of Angolan independence, in November 1975, though by February 1976, its FNLA forces had been largely defeated by the MPLA of the People's Republic of Angola. The Democratic People's Republic, at first, was inspired by Maoism and the Chinese Communist Revolution, including an explicit mention of the construction of socialism in its program, but later moved towards anti-communist positions. It was initially supported by the People's Republic of China and, later, by South Africa and the United States.
