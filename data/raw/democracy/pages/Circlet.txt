A circlet is a piece of headwear that is similar to a diadem or a corolla. The word 'circlet' is also used to refer to the base of a crown or a coronet, with or without a cap. Diadem and circlet are often used interchangeably, and 'open crowns' with no arches (as opposed to 'closed crowns') have also been referred to as circlets. In Greek this is known as stephanos, and in Latin as corona aperta, although stephanos is associated more with laurel wreaths and the crown of thorns said to have been placed on the head of Jesus.
