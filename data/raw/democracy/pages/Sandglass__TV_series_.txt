Sandglass (Korean: 모래시계) is a South Korean television series. It is one of the highest-rated Korean dramas in history, and is also considered one of the most significant. Written by Song Ji-na, directed by Kim Jong-hak and produced by their own company Jcom, it aired on SBS in 1995 in 24 episodes.
A depiction of the tragic relationship among three friends affected by the political and civilian oppression of 1970s and 1980s Korea, the series mixed politics, melodrama, and action. It recorded a peak rating of 64.5%, the fourth highest of all time, and launched its leading trio of Choi Min-soo, Go Hyun-jung, and Park Sang-won into stardom. Its reenactment of the Gwangju Uprising (interspersed with archival video footage) has been called one of the most realistic and memorable moments in Korean TV history.


== Synopsis ==
Sandglass is the story of two men whose friendship is tested through the 1970s and 80s, one of Korea's most volatile periods. Park Tae-soo (Choi Min-soo), tough and loyal, grows up to become a gangster and his pal Kang Woo-suk (Park Sang-won), smart with firm moral values, becomes a prosecutor. Yoon Hye-rin (Go Hyun-jung), a beautiful and spirited daughter of a wealthy casino owner, is a classmate of Woo-suk in college. She is introduced to Tae-soo via Woo-suk and they fall in love.
A notable aspect of this series is its depiction of the 1980 Gwangju Democratization Movement, an event during which Gen. Chun Doo-hwan, head of the military junta that took over the country after the assassination of President Park Chung Hee, sent paratroopers into Gwangju to violently crack down the uprising, resulting in a massacre of hundreds of civilians. A taboo subject during the airing of the series, the violent scenes (based on individual accounts) resulted in shock and grief for the public at that time. In the mid-90s, South Korea had not come to terms with what happened after the government muzzled free speech. "Sandglass" inspired a visible output of films dealing with the subject such as A Petal (1996) and Peppermint Candy (2000). It even influenced the prosecution of ex-President Chun Doo-hwan responsible for the massacre, resulting in his conviction decades after the incident.

A song, titled "Zhuravli" ("Crane"), by a Russian singer Joseph Kobzon was featured in the series. Although many Koreans did not understand the lyrics, it is still one of the most widely recognized song in Korea thanks to the show's popularity. The song actually mourns the Soviet soldiers killed while defending their homeland and who later became cranes. The lyrics blend well with the theme of the show since one of the major plot devices of the show, the Gwangju Massacre, commemorates the dead who were caught in the middle of the tragedy.
