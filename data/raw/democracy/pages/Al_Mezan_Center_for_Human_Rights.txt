Al Mezan Center for Human Rights (ميزان) is a non-governmental organization based in  Jabalia refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Its declared goals are to promote and protect human rights in the OPT with a focus on 'economic, social and cultural rights' (ESCR); to work towards the realization of individual and collective human rights, including the right to self-determination through the channels of international law; to enhance democracy and good governance that respects human rights. The organization has a special consultative status in the United Nations.


== Name ==
Mezan (ميزان) is Arabic for balance or scales, as well as justice and equity.


== Activities ==

The Al Mezan Center for Human Rights states it is dedicated to securing a permanent foundation for the protection of human rights in the Gaza Strip. Although it claims its long-term aim is to foster development of full economic, social, and cultural rights, during the current heightened conflict between Israelis and Palestinians the Al Mezan Center has focused on what it alleges are accelerating violations of basic civil rights and human rights, primarily by the Israeli Defense Forces.
In the role of human rights monitor, the Al Mezan Center documents alleged human rights violations, such as disproportionate military attacks on civilian areas that result in widespread civilian casualties, the practice of imprisonment without trial, political assassination, and official policies condoning brutality and torture that undermine development of civil society.  The center also provides legal aid, advocacy, and capacity-building services and resources and conducts educational activities to raise awareness in the local community about basic human rights, democracy, and the importance of international humanitarian relief.
