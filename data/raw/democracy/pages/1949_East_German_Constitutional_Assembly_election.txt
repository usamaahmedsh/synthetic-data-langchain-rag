Elections for the Third German People's Congress were held in East Germany on 15 and 16 May 1949. Voters were presented with a "Unity List" from the "Bloc of the Anti-Fascist Democratic Parties," which was dominated by the Communist-leaning Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). 


== Overview ==
The ballot was worded "I am for the unity of Germany and a just peace treaty. I therefore vote for the following list of candidates for the Third German People's Congress." with voters having the options of voting "yes" and "no". (German: Ich bin für die Einheit Deutschlands und einen gerechten Friedensvertrag. Ich stimme darum für die nachstehende Kandidatenliste zum Dritten Deutschen Volkskongreß.) In much of the country, the vote was not secret.
According to official figures, 95.2 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots, with 66 percent approving the list. This was the lowest level of support ever recorded for an SED-dominated bloc during the four decades of Communist rule, despite the election taking place under conditions that significantly constrained genuine political competition. In all subsequent elections until the Peaceful Revolution four decades later, the National Front, which succeeded the Democratic Bloc, would consistently claim 99 percent or more of the vote.
