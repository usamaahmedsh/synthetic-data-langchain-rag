Parliamentary elections were held in Algeria on 25 February 1977 to elect members to the new People's National Assembly. They were the first parliamentary elections since 1964, as the previous National Assembly had been dissolved in 1965, and were held as a result of the country's new constitution and electoral law being promulgated the year before.
The new Assembly had 261 members, elected from 160 constituencies (daira). Constituencies with less than 80,000 inhabitants had one representative; constituencies with more than 80,000 residents had one extra representative for every 20,000 inhabitants over 80,000.
As the country was a one-party state at the time, the National Liberation Front was the only party to run in the election. It put forward 783 candidates (of which 39 were women), and claimed all 261 seats (nine of which went to female candidates). Voter turnout was 76%.
