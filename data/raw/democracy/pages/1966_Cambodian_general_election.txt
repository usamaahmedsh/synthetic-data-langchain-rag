General elections were held in Cambodia on 11 September 1966. Only candidates of the Sangkum party were allowed to contest the election, although more than one candidate could run in a constituency. As a result, the party won all 82 seats. The conservative wing of the Sangkum gained a majority. On 18 October the National Assembly of Cambodia nominated Lon Nol as Prime Minister.


== Results ==
Only 28 of the 82 deputies had been previously elected to Parliament, six of whom were members of the conservative wing of the Sangkum.


== Government formation ==
The conservative wing of the Sangkum won a two-thirds majority in parliament, meaning Sihanouk could not prevent the opposition from blocking nominations. As a result, Lon Nol was elected Prime Minister with 59 votes in favour and 23 against.
