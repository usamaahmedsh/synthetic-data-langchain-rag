Partners in Population and Development (PPD) is a Southern-led, Southern-run global inter-governmental organization of 28 developing countries with commitment to promote south-south cooperation (SSC) in the field of reproductive health, population and development. Launched at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) by ten developing countries to support implementation of the Cairo Program of Action (POA), PPD has been awarded Permanent Observer Status at the United Nations and diplomatic status in Bangladesh. PPD has established itself as a key global south-south player in its areas of operation representing about 59% of the world population. 
Since its inception, PPD has contributed significantly to helping its member states improve reproductive health and family planning services, reduce maternal and child mortality and increase the voice of the global south towards addressing the ICPD agenda. The efforts of the Secretariat have contributed to PPD's institutionalization of south-south cooperation globally and established the Secretariat's permanent office building complex in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
With more than 25 years of the implementation of the ICPD Program of Action (PoA), the international community has realized that SSC is needed to tackle the unfinished ICPD agenda and the new emerging issues in Reproductive Health (RH), population and development.
According to their website, the PPD is the "only organization in the world fully dedicated to South-South partnerships."
