Constituent Assembly elections were held in Algeria on 20 September 1962, the first parliamentary elections since independence in July. The elections were held alongside a referendum that confirmed the powers and term length of the Assembly.
The Assembly was to have a one-year mandate to draw up and promulgate a constitution. A single list of 196 National Liberation Front candidates was put to voters to approve, 180 of which were Arabs and 16 of which were of European origin. A reported 99.6% voted in favour, with a turnout of 84%. 
The constitution was approved in a referendum in September 1963, and the mandate of the Assembly was extended by a year in accordance with article 77. However, President Ahmed Ben Bella froze the Assembly's activities and assumed full powers on 3 October 1963.
