The 1930 United States Senate election in Arkansas took place on November 4, 1930. Incumbent Democratic Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson was re-elected to a fourth term in office. He defeated Tom W. Campbell in the Democratic primary.
Because the Republican Party (or any other party) did not field a candidate in the general election, Robinson's primary victory was tantamount to election.
