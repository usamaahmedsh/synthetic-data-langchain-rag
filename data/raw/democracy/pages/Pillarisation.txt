Pillarisation (a calque from the Dutch: verzuiling [vɛrˈzœylɪŋ] ) is the vertical division of a society into separate groups, or pillars (Dutch: zuilen), organized along religious, socio-economic, and ideological lines. The phenomenon is most closely associated with historical examples in the Netherlands and Belgium. 
In a pillarised society, each pillar maintains its own institutions and social organizations. These may include newspapers, broadcasting organisations, political parties, trade unions, farmers' associations, banks, shops, schools, hospitals, universities, scouting groups, and sports clubs. This segregation results in limited social interaction between members of different pillars. In the Netherlands, society was historically divided into four main pillars: Catholic, Protestant, Socialist, and Liberal. The system allowed each community to maintain its own institutions and lifestyle, minimizing conflict among groups. Inter-pillar social relationships, including marriage and friendship, were generally discouraged. 
Pillarisation also reflected the social awareness of groups that had been marginalized or disadvantaged during the 19th century by the liberal bourgeoisie, which promoted Enlightenment ideals as universal norms. The system began to decline in the 1960s and 1970s, as social and political barriers weakened. However, traces of pillarisation remain visible in contemporary Dutch political parties, media institutions, and in certain conservative religious communities, such as those in the Dutch Bible Belt.
Comparable systems of social segmentation have been identified in other countries, including Northern Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Cyprus, Lebanon, and Malaysia.


== Pillarisation in the Netherlands ==
The Netherlands historically developed at least three main social pillars: Protestant, Catholic, and social democratic. Pillarisation in the country was initiated in the late 19th century by Abraham Kuyper, a theologian and politician associated with the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP), a Christian democratic and neo-Calvinist (gereformeerd) organization connected to the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. The movement was grounded in Kuyper’s philosophy of sphere sovereignty, which held that distinct areas of life—such as religion, politics, and education—should operate autonomously within their own spheres.
Although pillarisation declined during the 1960s and 1970s, its influence remains evident in Dutch society, particularly in communities outside the Randstad region, where aspects of pillarised life persist alongside broader participation in civil society.
The Catholic pillar was historically the most tightly organized, reflecting the Catholic clergy’s encouragement of collective organization within confessional institutions. The conservative Protestant pillar and the socialist pillar, which primarily represented the proletariat, were also highly cohesive. The Christian Historical Union (CHU), founded in 1908 and associated with the Dutch Reformed Church (hervormd), aligned itself with the Protestant pillar shaped by the ARP rather than creating a separate structure.
Those outside the three main pillars—primarily middle- and upper-class latitudinarian Protestants and atheists—were sometimes grouped into a liberal or "general" pillar. However, ties among liberal organizations were considerably weaker than within the other pillars. Liberals generally opposed the voluntary segregation of society and often denied that a liberal pillar existed. The political parties commonly linked with this group included the Free-thinking Democratic League (VDB) and the Liberal State Party (LSP). Smaller groups such as communists, humanists, and Protestant fundamentalists also established their own organizations, though on a much smaller scale.
The growth of pillarisation in the Netherlands was supported by two parallel developments: the emancipation of the working and lower-middle classes and the efforts of elites to maintain influence. The working-class emancipation led to the creation of socialist parties, trade unions, newspapers, cooperatives, and leisure organizations that provided comprehensive social support to their members, similar to patterns observed elsewhere in Europe. The rise of the Protestant pillar reflected the mobilization of the conservative, often strongly religious lower-middle class. While the Dutch bourgeoisie tended to espouse liberal or moderate Protestant beliefs, large segments of the lower-middle class followed Kuyper’s neo-Calvinism, which was both more traditional and more accessible to ordinary people than the established Protestant churches.
Kuyper’s doctrine of sphere sovereignty rejected both ecclesiasticism (the idea of church dominance over all social spheres) and statist secularism (the idea of state dominance over all spheres), arguing instead for distinct, autonomous domains within society. In 1879, Kuyper founded the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) as the political expression of his religious movement and as the institutional foundation of the Protestant pillar. 
Meanwhile, elites sought to retain control over emerging social movements: for example, Catholic clergy established confessional trade unions to prevent Catholic workers from joining socialist organizations. The creation of Christian political parties also reflected an effort to counterbalance the expanding influence of left-wing mass movements.

The following table shows the most important institutions by pillar:


=== Depillarisation ===

After World War II, during which the Dutch resistance itself was divided along pillarised lines, political and social groups from across the spectrum—including liberals, socialists, Protestants, and Catholics—began questioning the existing pillarised system. In response, they founded the People’s Movement (Nederlandse Volksbeweging), a unity initiative intended to renew the political landscape through what became known as the doorbraak ("breakthrough") movement. Participants from various ideological backgrounds, including members of the Catholic resistance group Christofoor, sought to overcome divisions between the pillars and create a more integrated society.
Despite these efforts, the entrenched nature of pillarisation limited the movement’s success. To promote unity, the Social Democratic Workers’ Party, the left-liberal Free-thinking Democratic League, and the Christian-socialist Christian Democratic Union merged to form the Labour Party (Partij van de Arbeid, PvdA), a progressive party intended to be open to all citizens. However, the PvdA failed to attract significant support from Catholic and Reformed voters and became primarily associated with the socialist pillar.
In the early years of radio and television broadcasting, pillarisation also influenced the organization of media. While Dutch broadcasters were divided along pillar lines, the separation in television was relatively limited, as all broadcasters shared the Netherlands’ single national television channel (expanded to two channels after 1964), which was viewed by the entire audience.
The 1960s marked a period of major social and political transformation. The pillars began to dissolve under criticism from emerging political movements, notably Democrats 66 (D66) and the New Left (Nieuw Links) faction within the PvdA. Rising mobility, affluence, and educational opportunities enabled greater contact among citizens from different backgrounds, reducing perceived differences between groups. Younger generations increasingly rejected affiliation with pillarised institutions, leading to the gradual decline of the system.
Between 1973 and 1980, the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the Christian Historical Union—both Protestant—merged with the Catholic People’s Party to form the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). The new party first contested the 1977 Dutch general election. Similarly, cooperation between the Catholic trade union (Nederlands Katholiek Vakverbond, NKV) and the socialist trade union (Nederlandse Verbond van Vakverenigingen, NVV) began in 1976, culminating in their merger as the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions in 1982.
Although formal pillarisation diminished, its influence persisted into the 21st century. The Dutch public broadcasting system remains organized along multiple association-based lines rather than as a single entity. The country also continues to maintain both public and religious schools, a division rooted in pillarisation-era education policies.
Certain communities continue to exhibit pillar-like characteristics. As of 2014, members of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated) maintain their own schools, a national newspaper, and other organizations such as a labour union. Several pietist Reformed groups have similarly established their own schools, press outlets, and political movements. Muslim communities have increasingly utilized legal frameworks originally designed for pillarised institutions to create their own educational establishments.
Residual effects of pillarisation are still reflected in voting patterns. For example, regions that were historically Catholic strongholds often show distinctive political tendencies, including higher support for populist parties in contemporary elections.


== Pillarisation in Belgium ==

Pillarisation in Belgium closely resembled that of the Netherlands, though it developed without a Protestant pillar, as the Protestant population was relatively small. There was also no "general" pillar, but a politically organized liberal pillar existed alongside the Catholic and later the Socialist pillars. In 1911, the British sociologist Seebohm Rowntree noted that in Belgium:

There is extraordinarily little social intercourse between Catholics and Liberals, and practically none between Catholics and Socialists. Politics enter into almost every phase of social activity and philanthropic effort, and it is the exception rather than the rule for persons holding different political opinions to co-operate in any other matter. Thus in one town there will be a Catholic, a Liberal and a Socialist trade union, a Catholic, a Liberal and a Socialist thrift society, each catering for similar people, but each confining its attentions to members of its own political party. The separation extends to cafes, gymnasia, choral, temperance, and literary societies; indeed it cuts through life!
In both Flanders and Wallonia, societies were pillarised between Catholic and Liberal political denominations which were subsequently joined by a Socialist pillar. While liberal influence in Belgium—particularly in Brussels—was stronger than in the Netherlands, it remained limited by the liberals' relatively small, middle-class base of support. Liberal trade unions were correspondingly small. The financial daily De Tijd is associated with liberal readers, while Het Laatste Nieuws, a Flemish newspaper, also has historical liberal roots.
Denominational schools, mainly Catholic and a few Jewish, receive partial public funding, though not full parity with state schools as in the Netherlands, so that tuition is almost entirely free. Belgian universities charge comparable, relatively low tuition fees across the board.
During the latter half of the twentieth century, Belgium’s long-standing language struggle led to the division of existing pillars along language lines, creating separate Flemish/Dutch, Walloon/French, and German-speaking segments within the Catholic, Liberal, and Socialist pillars. This linguistic split became the dominant source of societal division. The pillar system remained a central organizing force in Belgian society for a longer period than in the Netherlands. It only began to decline near the end of the Cold War, particularly at the individual level, though its institutional influence persisted.
Political movements that emerged in the late 20th century, such as Vlaams Blok, Vlaams Belang, Groen, and the New Flemish Alliance, did not attempt to build new pillars. 
Traces of pillarisation have also been visible in everyday social life. Musical groups, sports clubs, and recreational associations were often organized along pillar lines. Although weakened in contemporary Belgium, many large social organizations—including trade unions and cooperatives—continue to operate within the traditional boundaries of the pillar system. Elements of pillarisation have continued to shape Belgian politics. For instance, the 1999–2003 Rainbow Coalition led by Guy Verhofstadt was often described using the framework of pillarisation.  


=== Institutions by pillar with their ethnic divisions ===
The following table is limited to the most important institutions and it shows the current division of everyone by the three ethnic groups.

=== Proporz in Austria ===

The Austrian version of pillarisation is the Proporz system (a hypocorism for Proportionalität, German for 'proportionality'). A political structure of the second Austrian republic, it later evolved into a neo-corporatist system characterized by widespread patronage and nepotism that extended into many areas of Austrian society.
The Proporz system was developed and maintained by the two dominant political parties: the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), representing Catholic and conservative interests, and the Socialist Party of Austria (SPÖ), renamed the Social Democratic Party of Austria in 1991. This de facto two-party system collapsed after the 1999 Austrian legislative election, when the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) joined the government. The FPÖ’s earlier marginalization—along with that of its predecessor, the Federation of Independents—had been one of the reasons for establishing the Proporz system, due to their pro-German, far right and individualist views.
The Proporz system emerged from a desire for stable, consensus-based governance during Austria’s post–World War II reconstruction period. It was closely associated with the grand coalitions in which the SPÖ and the ÖVP have shared governmental responsibilities.
As in the Netherlands and Belgium, Austria’s main political blocs created extensive parallel structures within civil society. Many organizations reflected this dual alignment: for example, automobile clubs such as the ÖAMTC (aligned with the ÖVP) and ARBÖ (aligned with the SPÖ), rival factions within the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB) such as the FCG, FSG, and Freiheitlichen Arbeitnehmer (FPÖ), and sports associations like Sportunion and ASKÖ. These "black" (ÖVP-aligned) and "red" (SPÖ-aligned) institutions illustrate the persistence of Proporz as a defining feature of Austria’s social and political organization.


=== Italy ===
A comparable form of pillarisation existed in Italy during the period of the First Italian Republic.
Multiple trade unions were aligned with different political parties and ideologies. The Italian Confederation of Trades Unions maintained close ties with Christian Democracy, while the Italian General Confederation of Labour was associated with the Italian Communist Party. The General Labour Union was linked to the Italian Social Movement, and the Italian Labour Union had connections with the Italian Republican Party and the Italian Democratic Socialist Party.
The state-owned public broadcaster RAI was also divided along party lines. Rai 1 was generally regarded as being close to Christian Democracy, Rai 2 to the Italian Socialist Party, and Rai 3 to the Italian Communist Party.


=== Northern Ireland ===

The term "pillarisation" has also been applied to describe the segregation between the two principal ethno-religious communities in Northern Ireland, particularly between the establishment of Northern Ireland in 1922 and the end of The Troubles (1969–1998). Although both segregation and elements of pillarisation continue to exist, they have been gradually declining.
A distinctive feature of pillarisation in Northern Ireland was the imbalance of power between the two groups. The Protestant–Unionist–Loyalist population held clear political, economic, and social dominance over the Catholic–Nationalist–Republican community. This dynamic has been characterized as a form of pillarisation "without consociationalism", meaning that, unlike in the Netherlands or Belgium, social separation existed without an accompanying system of power-sharing or institutional balance between the communities.

Since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, various efforts have been made to reduce segregation in Northern Ireland. "Cross-community" political parties such as the Alliance Party, the Green Party, and People Before Profit exist and an increasing number of voters now identify as "other" rather than aligning with traditional Catholic or Protestant identities. There has also been a rise in the number of people identifying as atheists.
Despite these developments, elections in Northern Ireland are often characterized as a "sectarian head-count", with concerns growing among some members of the Protestant community about the potential emergence of a Catholic majority.
Historically, other non-sectarian political organizations also operated in Northern Ireland, including the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition.
