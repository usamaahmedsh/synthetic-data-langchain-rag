The author came up with the idea for this work back in 2022, at the height of Russia's war against Ukraine, after the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was blown up. The author realized his idea in Dnipro.
The pipes are painted in national colors – yellow on the outside and blue on the inside – to emphasize national identity.
