The Sukhodilska–Skhidna coal mine (Ukrainian: Шахта «Суходільська-Східна») is a large underground coal mine located in Southeast Ukraine in Luhansk Oblast. Sukhodilska–Skhidna coal mine represents one of the largest coal reserves in Ukraine, having estimated reserves of 157.4 million tonnes. The annual coal production is around 712,000 tonnes.
Bituminous coal is mined using longwall mining at depths between 785 and 1,028 m. The mine began operation in 1980.


== July 2011 mining accident ==
Shortly before 2 a.m. on 29 July 2011 an explosion occurred 3,000 feet (910 meters) underground in the mine. Initial reports indicated that at least 17 people were killed, and nine others were missing, but later all 26 were reported to have died.
Investigators suspect the accident was caused by a powerful explosion of methane. Mykhailo Volynets, the head of the Independent Trade Union of Miners, called the Sukhodilska–Skhidna coal mine "one of the most dangerous in Ukraine" due to buildups of methane and coal dust. The President of Ukraine ordered the government to set up a commission to investigate the accident.
Later that same day, Ukraine experienced a second fatal coal-mining accident when an elevator collapsed at the Bazhanov coal mine.
