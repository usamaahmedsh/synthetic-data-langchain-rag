The United Nations Angola Verification Mission I (I UNAVEM) was a peacekeeping mission that existed from January 1989 to June 1991 in Angola during the civil war. It was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 626 on December 20, 1988.
In the civil war, the Soviet Union and Cuba backed the Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola (MPLA), while South Africa and the United States backed the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA). The MPLA became the stronger party.
UNAVEM I's purpose was oversee withdrawal of the Cuban troops. This mission was a success.
The United Nations created a follow-up mission, United Nations Angola Verification Mission II, in 1991.
