The History of Ukrainian literature includes laws of the historical and literary process, literary genres, trends, works of individual writers, features of their style, and the importance of artistic heritage in the development of Ukrainian literature.
Ukrainian literature has a thousand-year history. Its beginnings date back to the formation of Kievan Rus. However, even in prehistoric times (before the ninth century), the ancestors of Ukrainians had a developed oral art.


== Literature of Rus ==

First works of literature in medieval Rus had a religious character and were influenced by the Byzantine Greek literary tradition. Early examples of written culture in Rus lands include the Ostromir Gospels (1057) and the Tmutarakan stone of prince Gleb Sviatoslavich (1068), as well as the Sermon on Law and Grace by Hilarion of Kiev. The latter has many common features with the most outstanding written monument of Kievan Rus, the chronicle Tale of the Past Years, which is not only a source of historical information but also a textbook of epic songs and legends of the era. 
Didactic literature of the Rus period includes writings by prominent religious and political figures such as Theodosius of Pechersk, Vladimir Monomakh, Kliment Smoliatich, Kirill of Turov and others, as well as hagiographic works, such as the Kyiv Caves Patericon. 
Some Rus chronicles also include elements of epic poetry. Epic tradition of the Rus culminated in The Tale of Igor's Campaign, a poetic masterpiece of medieval literature most likely created in the late 12th - early 13th century. According to Ukrainian literary critic Filaret Kolessa, The Tale is distinct from the rest of old Rus literature due to its entirely secular character, and its creation was likely inspired by traditions of folk poetry. This heroic epic absorbed the best examples of folk art of that time and became the property and pride of the whole Slavic world.
The main literary work created in the territory of modern-day Western Ukraine in the 13th century is the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle. Many of its passages are characterized with a colourful language reminiscent of secular epic literature. The chronicle is a valuable historical source and an important document of medieval European literature.


== Late Medieval and Early Modern Ukrainian literature ==
The Mongol invasion of Rus started a period of cultural decline, which continued for three centuries. Original works of literature created between mid-13th and mid-16th century in the territory of modern-day Ukraine are very rare. The number of compilations and rewritten works also declined during that time. This period is characterized by significant influence of Bulgarian culture on the literature of former Rus.  The language used in written works created in Ukrainian ethnic territories during that era also contains some features influenced by Czech (especially in Galicia) and Belarusian languages. Translations and compilations of Western Catholic literature were also present.

A milestone in the history of Ukrainian and other Slavic literatures was the introduction of bookprinting. Among the first Slavic book publishers was Schweipolt Fiol, a native of Germany, who in 1491 opened the first Cyrillic printing press in Kraków and produced Orthodox religious literature. Judging from linguistic elements present in the books printed by Fiol, it is theoretized that his workers or customers may have stemmed from today's Ukraine.
In the mid-16th century literary tradition in lands of modern Ukraine saw a rise in activity due to the influences of Protestant Reformation. One of the authors inspired by Protestant ideas during that time was Stanisław Orzechowski, a Latin-language writer from a mixed Catholic-Orthodox family born in the Ruthenian Voivodeship of Poland, near the modern-day Polish-Ukrainian border. Orzhechowski's works argued for the protection of Orthodox Ruthenian traditions inherited from old Rus and condemned Catholic practices such as rebaptism and celibacy. 
Another event which contributed to the development of a new literature in Ukrainian lands was the calendar reform introduced by the Catholic Church in 1582. Protesting against decrees prohibiting the Orthodox faithful from celebrating their feasts according to the old calendar, in 1587 Herasym Smotrytsky, rector of the Ostroh Academy, issued a pamphlet in defence of the Orthodox faith and Ruthenian people. Smotrytskyi's literary activities were supported by Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski, an Orthodox Ruthenian prince and voivode of Kyiv. 

An important representative of early modern literature in Ukrainian lands was Ivan Vyshenskyi, an Orthodox monk from Galicia, who issued numerous polemic writings opposing the Union of Brest and defending the Lviv Orthodox brotherhood from Catholic persecution. Vyshenskyi's pamphlets were issued specifically for the population of "Little Rus", as Ukraine was known during that time, and corresponded with notable figures such as bishop Meletius Smotrytsky, and prince Ostrogski. Among Vyshenskyi's followers were Zacharias Kopystensky, Stefan Zyzanii and Yurii Rohatynets, who also created polemic literature in defence of the Orthodoxy. During the 1590s a group of writers emerged in Ostroh, the cultural and educational centre of Ukrainian lands in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Most prominent among them was Demian Nalyvaiko, a fierce critic of the Uniate Church. Their opponent in polemics was Ipatii Potii, Uniate metropolitan of Kyiv. 
Literature of Ruthenian (Ukrainian and Belarusian) lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth also included works of political satire, some of which have been preserved to our day. Valuable memoirs from that time belong to Bozhko Balyka, a patrician from Kyiv, who travelled to Moscow during the Polish-Muscovite War in the early 17th century. Early modern period also saw the spread of poetry in Ukrainian lands, greatly contributed by the works of the Ostroh literary circle. An original genre of literature which emerged in Ukraine during that time were epic folk songs known as dumas, which were usually dedicated to the deeds of Cossacks.


== Ukrainian literature during the 17-18th centuries ==

Economic decline of cities under the pressure of landed gentry, as well the abolition of Orthodox hierarchy by Polish Catholic authorities, led to the decrease in cultural activities among the urban classes of today's Western Ukraine during the 17th century. As a result, the development of Ukrainian literature continued further to the east, in the lands of Dnieper Ukraine centered around Kyiv. Cultural development of that area was seriously influenced by Zaporozhian Cossacks, who used their political influence over the Commonwealth to support Ukrainian Orthodox clergy. This process was especially active during the hetmanate of Petro Sahaidachny. The main centre of literary activities and publishing emerged in Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, represented by authors and publishers such as Pamvo Berynda, Zacharias Kopystensky, Taras Zemka, Yelysei Pletenetskyi, Tymofii Verbytskyi, Spiridon Sobol, and Oleksandr Mytura.

Orthodox brotherhoods presented another important centre of literary activity in early 17th-century Ukraine. In Kyiv and Lutsk their members organized own schools, which provided education in Greek, Latin and Church Slavonic. A prominent author from Kyiv during that period was Kasian Sakovych, rector of the Kyiv Brotherhood School (future Kyiv-Mohyla Academy), known for his panegyric poem written for the burial of hetman Sahaidachny. The renewal of Orthodox hierarchy by Polish authorities in 1621-1622 contributed to a new literary discussion. This period in Ukrainian literature saw the emergence of the idea of Ukrainian Cossacks being a continuation of the old Rus state centered around Kyiv. Cultural orientation of Ukrainian authors during that time can be seen as an intermediary position between the Polish-Latin West and Oriental Muscovy.
A prominent figure of Ukrainian literature in the mid-17th century was Petro Mohyla, Orthodox Metropolitan of Kyiv, who was a creator of several works in the sphere of religious literature. Several works written by poets from Kyiv's orthodox schools were dedicated to the metropolitan during his lifetime. Activities of the Kyiv Brotherhood school, transformed by Mohyla into a collegium, contributed to the establishment of Baroque as the dominant style in the literature of Ukrainian lands during that era. Baroque period saw the emergence of new historical works such as the Hustyn Chronicle, Cossack chronicles of Samiilo Velychko and Hryhorii Hrabianka, as well as the Chronicle of Samovydets, which describe the events of Ukrainian history during the 16th and 17th centuries. Those chronicles inspired two important ideological works, which attained popularity in Ukraine during the Hetmanate and Russian Imperial eras: Kievan Synopsis (1674) by Innokenti Gisel and the History of Ruthenians (first published in 1846). The latter text provided basis for the development of modern Ukrainian national identity. 
Unlike Baroque, the style of Classicism, which came to prominence in the 18th century, didn't develop in Ukraine to a similar extent. Due to the abolition of Ukrainian autonomy in the second half of the century, both the Orthodox clergy and the political elite adopted Russian as their primary language. Classicist poets of Ukrainian origin, such as Ippolit Bogdanovich and Vasily Kapnist, became one of the most prominent representatives of this style in Russian literature. At the same time, the era of Classicism accelerated the process of transition from the old Ukrainian literary language, significantly influenced by Church Slavonic, to the new one, which was closer to speech used by the common people.


== New Ukrainian literature ==


=== Under Russian Rule ===
At the end of the 18th century Ivan Kotliarevsky's burlesque travesty narrative poem Eneida marked the emergence of Ukrainian literary language and the beginning of modern Ukrainian literature. This work depicted ancient epic heroes and gods as the author's Ukrainian contemporaries, reflecting the richness of common Ukrainian speech and giving a valuable insight into the material culture of that era. Kotliarevsky also wrote the first plays in modern Ukrainian language: "Natalka Poltavka" and "Moskal-Charivnyk". The humorous and satirical tone of Kotlyarevsky's works was picked up by other writers, primarily members of the so-called Kharkiv circle (most prominently Petro Hulak-Artemovsky, Hryhoriy Kvitka-Osnovyanenko), as well as Vasyl Hohol-Yanovsky. The first prose works in Ukrainian - "Marusya," "Konotopska vidma," and "Saldatsky patret" - were written by Kvitka-Osnovyanenko, who became the founder of modern Ukrainian fiction, breaking the tradition of using Ukrainian language only in comedic genres.
Starting from the late 1820s, Romanticism was adopted as a new style in Ukrainian literature. Poets of the so-called Kharkiv School of Romantics (Amvrosy Metlinsky, Mykola Kostomarov, Levko Borovykovsky, M. Petrenko, Yakiv Shchoholiv and others) made a great contribution to the development of Ukrainian literature. In Kyiv  Romantic movement was boosted by activities of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Many romantic authors, such as Izmail Sreznevsky, also engaged in ethnographic work, publishing Ukrainian folk poetry, songs, proverbs etc. During that time so-called "Ukrainian schools" appeared in Russian and Polish literatures, most prominently represented by Yevhen Hrebinka and Tomasz Padura respectively.

The most outstanding Ukrainian writer of the 19th century was Taras Shevchenko – a poet, artist, author of prose and dramatic works. He debuted in 1840 with his collection of poems Kobzar, followed by the poem Haidamaky (1841) and play Nazar Stodolia (1843). Shevchenko's latter poems Dream (1844),  Caucasus, Naimychka , To the dead, and living..., Heretic (all 1845) sharply criticized Russian imperial rule over Ukrainians and other subjugated peoples, which eventually resulted in their author's exile by the tsarist government.
Despite the House of Romanov's colonial policy of coercive Russification of Ukraine, which included the 1863 Valuev Circular and 1876 Ems Ukaz, Ukrainian literature continued to develop and achieved significant success during the period of Realism. Prominent authors from Russian-ruled parts of Ukraine during the second half of the 19th century included Leonid Hlibov, Panteleimon Kulish, Marko Vovchok, Marko Kropyvnytskyi, Oleksa Storozhenko, Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky, Panas Myrny, Mykhailo Starytsky. During that period ethnographic works and studies of Ukrainian folklore were published by prominent Ukrainian activists and scientists such as Volodymyr Antonovych, Mykhailo Drahomanov, Alexander Potebnia. Among important Ukrainian authors of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were Ivan Karpenko-Karyi, Ivan Manzhura, Borys Hrinchenko, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, Lesya Ukrainka, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Pavlo Hrabovsky, Mykola Voronyi, Oleksandr Oles, Spiridon Cherkasenko and Arkhip Teslenko, who made a significant contribution to the development of Ukrainian literature under the Russian rule.


=== Under Austro-Hungarian rule ===

In Western Ukraine Classicism with Baroque elements remained a dominant style into the 1830s. During that period local authors oriented themselves on the Russian literary tradition, but failed to achieve significant success. In Carpathian Ruthenia Vasyl Dovhovych created original verses with elements of common speech, and Mykhailo Luchkay followed the travesty tradition widespread in Dnieper Ukraine. 
Starting from the late 1830s Ukrainian authors from Galicia (Eastern Europe) introduced themselves to the Romantic movement. This process was started by the publication of Rusalka Dnistrovaya, the first literary almanac to be published in common Ukrainian language, by members of the so-called Ruthenian Triad: Markiian Shashkevych, Yakiv Holovatskyi and Ivan Vahylevych. Works of literature from that period were published in Zoria Halytska, the first Ukrainian-language newspaper founded in 1848. Other prominent authors in Western Ukraine during the early and mid-19th century were Ivan Hushalevych, Ivan Mohylnytskyi, Mykola Ustyianovych and Yuriy Fedkovych. 
In 1849 studies of Ukrainian literature became part of the curriculum of Lviv University, which contributed to further literary development in Western Ukraine. However, in the 1850s Moscophile ideas started dominating in Galician literature under the influence of Russian historian Mikhail Pogodin. An important representative of Sentimentalism in Carpathian Ruthenia during that time was Alexander Dukhnovych.
In the second half of the 19th century Ukrainian literary revival under Austrian rule was spearheaded by the new generation of authors, most prominently Ivan Franko, Sydir Vorobkevych, Natalia Kobrynska, Olha Kobylianska, Osyp Makovei, Vasyl Stefanyk, Bohdan Lepkyi and others.


== Soviet period ==

After the revolution, the literary process was particularly dramatic and complex in Ukraine, as in the entire USSR. On the one hand, Ukrainian literature at that time was experiencing an unprecedented zenith. On a rich literary palette, various art schools, styles, and trends coexisted – from radical proletarianism, whose theorists promoted the creation of a "purely proletarian culture" by "laboratory means" (V. Blaktyny, G. Mikhaylichenko, M. Khvylvoy) to futurism (M. Semenko) and even neoclassicism, whose representatives were guided by the creation of high harmonious art based on the development of classical samples of World Literature (a group of neoclassicists led by M. Zerov).
In 1925–1928, a "literary discussion" was held – a public discussion about the ways of development, ideologies, aesthetic orientation, and objectives of the new Ukrainian Soviet literature, the place, and role of the writer in society. The discussion arose due to deep differences in understanding of the nature and purpose of artistic creativity among Ukrainian writers, and the ideological and political competition of literary organizations.
However, most of the representatives of this wave of Ukrainian revival died during the Civil War, the Holodomor of 1932–33, Red Terror, and the Bolshevik repressions of the Great Purge of the 1930s. In 1938–1954, about 240 Ukrainian writers were repressed, although many of them were supporters of the Soviet government, fought for it, and became writers after the revolution. Some of them were shot, some died in prison, and the fate of some of them remained unknown after the arrests. The poet M. Rylsky, recognized by the Soviet authorities, was arrested and spent 10 years in the camps on charges of participating in a mythical Ukrainian military organization. Ostap Vyshnya, G. Kosynka, M. Zerov, M. Kulish, Y. Pluzhnyk, and M. Semenko were shot. M. Khvylovy, who tried to save many comrades, committed suicide.  The Experimental Theater "Berezil" was also banned, and its head – the world-famous director Les Kurbas – was arrested and shot. This generation of writers in the history of Ukrainian literature has become known as – "Executed Renaissance."
Despite the rigid framework of the Soviet-style style of socialist realism, Ukrainian writers managed to create literature that has not lost its relevance today. These are, first of all, works by P. Tychyna, M. Rylsky, V. Sosiura, O. Dovzhenko, O. Honchar and others.


== Contemporary Ukrainian literature ==

Modern Ukrainian prose is the Ukrainian literature of recent decades, created by modern writers. the scientific literature does not specify exactly from what point Ukrainian literature should be considered modern. However, the concept of "modern Ukrainian literature" is most often understood as a set of works of fiction – written from the time of Ukraine's independence in 1991 to the present. This distinction is due to the disappearance after 1991 of the generally binding style of socialist realism for artists of the USSR and the abolition of Soviet censorship. Fundamental changes in Ukrainian literature occurred during the years of Perestroika (1985) and especially after the Chernobyl disaster (1986). Some researchers believe that modern Ukrainian literature begins in the 1970s after the generation of the Sixties.
