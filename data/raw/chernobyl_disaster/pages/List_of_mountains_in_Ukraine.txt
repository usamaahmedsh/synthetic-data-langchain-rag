There are two predominant mountain regions in Ukraine: the Carpathians and the Crimean Mountains. Ukraine is located at East European Plain, therefore most of its area consists mostly of rolling hills rather than real mountains. Some high peaks could be found in areas of Podilian Tovtry and Donets Ridge and rarely elsewhere.

Chornohora (lit. 'Black Mountain') is a mountain range in the Carpathians which consists of the highest mountain peaks in the country. Other notable ranges are Maramureş and Gorgany, also located in the Carpathians. In the Crimean Mountains, the highest mountain range, Babuğan yayla, is located closer to the Crimean Southern Coast and is part of the main mountain chain.
