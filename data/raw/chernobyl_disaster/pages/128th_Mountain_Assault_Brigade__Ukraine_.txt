=== Red Army ===
The 128th Mechanized Division was first formed within the then USSR's Red Army as the 1st Turkmenistan Rifle Division on 12 July 1922 in the city of Poltoratsk (now Ashgabat, Turkmenistan). (Other sources give the original name as the 1st Turkmenistan Mountain Division). It was a Turkmen national formation. Serhiy Tumoshkov became the division's first commander. The division was renamed 83rd Mountain Rifle Division on 1 July 1935. On 22 June 1941 the 83rd Mountain Rifle Division was part of the 58th Rifle Corps, Central Asia Military District. Between 1 September and 1 October 1941, the division was assigned to the 53rd Army, still located within the Central Asia Military District. By January 1942 the division, still with 58th Rifle Corps, had been dispatched to Iran as part of the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran.
From 1 January 1943 the division fought near the area of Krasnodar where it was assigned to the 56th Army. After successfully liberating the region of Kuban and the Taman Peninsula, the division was awarded the Guards designation on 8 October 1943 and renamed the 128th Guards Turkmenistan Rifle Division.
On 24 April 1944, for participation in the battles for Crimea, the division was awarded its first Order of the Red Banner. During the month of August, the division participated in battles for the Carpathian Mountains. The division captured Northeast Hungary, what later became Zakarpattya in the Soviet Union, and on 12 October 1944 crossed the border with Czechoslovakia. Units of the division occupied Ostrava, Olomouc and other cities.
Postwar, the division was stationed in Mukacheve and became part of the 38th Army. During October and November 1956, it took part in Operation Whirlwind, the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The division captured Debrecen and Szolnok and Jászberény. Advancing westward, it participated in the storming of Budapest. On 15 December 1956, the division became the 128th Guards Motor Rifle Division at Esztergom. In July 1958, the division was moved back to Mukacheve. In 1968, the division participated in Operation Danube, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. During the operation, eleven soldiers of the division were killed. In May 1976, it was granted the honorific title "Marshal of the Soviet Union Andriy Hrechko".

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
A base belonging to the 128th Brigade was bombarded as part of the initial Russian strikes on military targets on 24 February 2022. The brigade abandoned its base and was deployed to the vicinity of Melitopol. It was eventually pushed 70 miles to the north, where it took up positions to prevent Russian forces from reaching the city of Zaporizhzhia, as of April 2022.
A battalion tactical group of the 128th Brigade under Col. Denys Chaiuk was at training grounds in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast at the beginning of the war. It traveled 200 km in order to reach Melitopol by the next day, covering the retreat of units of the National Guard of Ukraine from the city. It later withdrew to the Vasylivka-Tokmak defensive line, and eventually to a defensive line at Kam'yanske-Orikhiv where it successfully halted the Russian offensive.
In April 2022, units of the brigade took part in the fighting in the Luhansk region. On 7 April, it was announced that soldiers of the brigade had pushed Russian troops 6-10 kilometers away from Kreminna.
The brigade took part in the 2022 Ukrainian southern counteroffensive. In the brigade's native Zakarpattia Oblast on 2 September 2022, a day of mourning was held after the deaths of seven residents of the region who served in the brigade. During  the southern counteroffensive, the brigade recaptured Myroliubivka on 3 October 2022, followed by a string of villages on the right bank of the Dnieper River. This was part of an October offensive operation conducted by one of the 128th Brigade's battalions, along with a battalion of Ukraine's 60th Brigade, which forced Russian troops to retreat from parts of the Kherson Oblast west of the Dnieper River towards the villages of Dudchany and Mylove.
On 18 February 2023 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the brigade was operating and fighting in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 
Lysiuk, the brigade's commander, confirmed to The Guardian in mid-October 2023 that the brigade was still fighting in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. On 3 November 2023 a Russian strike killed members of the brigade while on a ceremony on the occasion of Rocket Forces and Artillery Day, on 5 November Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Kucherenko reported that 28 soldiers had been killed and 53 others wounded. Three days of mourning were held in Zakarpattia Oblast. On 6 November the 128th Brigade itself confirmed the deaths of 19 soldiers in the strike.
