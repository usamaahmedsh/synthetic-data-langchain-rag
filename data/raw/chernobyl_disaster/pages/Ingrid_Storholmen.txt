== Reception ==
Tore Stavlund, writing on Poetry International, observes that "There is a gravity to Storholmen's poetry. From 2000 onwards, across four publications of poetry and one book of prose, she has developed a poetic language and a set of motifs which shirk neither human tragedy, nor the individual’s search for belonging, whether it be through love or family relationships." Voices from Chernobyl consists of several fictionalized accounts told by Chernobyl survivors, based on interviews Storholmen conducted with real victims. Critics noted how the book's lack of internal continuity reflects the chaos in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. Storholmen hoped her book would remind people to remember disasters such as Chernobyl and Bhopal and to be wary of dangerous technology.
