HMS Vittoria was a British destroyer of the Admiralty V-class. She was converted to a minelayer.
During Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War it was torpedoed by the Bolshevik submarine Pantera off the island of Seiskari in the Gulf of Finland on 31 August 1919.
The sunken destroyer was given to the state of Finland on 12 December 1919 together with her sister ship Verulam; however, when salvaging began in 1925, it was found that both ships were broken in two and impossible to repair.
In November 2013, Russian divers rediscovered the wreck at a depth of 30 meters (98 feet), at a location inside what is now Russian territorial waters.
