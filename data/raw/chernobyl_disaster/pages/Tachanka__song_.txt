"Tachanka" (; Russian: Tачанка [tɐˈtɕankə]), also known as the "Song of the Tachanka" (Песня о Тачанке), is a Russian-language Soviet revolutionary song from the late interwar period, composed by Konstantin Listov and written by Mikhail Ruderman in 1937.
When Listov read the poem written by Ruderman, it reminded him of a personal military incident, where he observed a White Army encircling a Red Army battalion and a Red soldier pushing towards the battalion on a tachanka; the soldier successfully reached his allies but was mortally injured. The text describes the unnamed battle in the Russian Civil War and the tachankas that were used by the Red Army at the time.
"Tachanka" was first performed on 18 December 1937 in Moscow Conservatory, and was adapted into a short-film released by film studio Lendoc.
It underwent several lyrical changes over the years, and features in the repertoire of the Red Army Choir and Leon Lishner.
