The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines intangible cultural heritage elements as non-physical traditions and practices performed by a people. As part of a country's cultural heritage, they include celebrations, festivals, performances, oral traditions, music, and the making of handicrafts. The term "intangible cultural heritage" is formally established by the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, which was drafted in 2003 and took effect in 2006. The inscription of new heritage elements on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists for protection and safeguarding is determined by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, an organization established by the Convention. Ukraine ratified the Convention on 27 May 2008.
Since 2012, the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine has also maintained the National Register of Elements of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Ukraine to safeguard the country's cultural elements, which is required by the Convention for the further nomination of elements to the UNESCO lists. In turn, to enter the National Register, elements must play a significant role in the social life of a community and have concrete measures of protection for a period of one to five years. Submissions of elements are reviewed by the Expert Council on Intangible Cultural Heritage, an advisory body that controls the inscription of elements on the Register.
As of November 2025, seven items from Ukraine are inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity Lists. The first Ukrainian element listed – Petrykivka decorative painting – was inscribed in 2013. The egg painting tradition of pysanka is a transnational element shared with Estonia. Three items were nominated for inclusion on the UNESCO lists in 2026: the Embroidery technique 'white-in-white' of the town Reshetylivka in Poltava region; the Rivne region tradition of the Polissia Dudka-Vykrutka; and the Safeguarding practice of the "Tradition of the Generous Evening in Ukraine" through formal and non-formal education. In addition, 117 items are inscribed on Ukraine's National Register. Although all regions of Ukraine are represented in the National Register through elements such as borscht and holubtsi, it does not yet include entries specific to Kherson, Kirovohrad, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, nor to the city of Sevastopol.
