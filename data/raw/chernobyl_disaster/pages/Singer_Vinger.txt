Singer Vinger is an Estonian punk rock band. It was founded in 1985, before that being named Pära Trust (Backside Trust, 1979–1983), Turist (Tourist, 1983–1985), and Aken (Window), among other names. The name Singer Vinger was picked by the authorities because Turist was deemed inappropriate by the Soviet Estonian ministry of culture. Throughout the name changes, the band's leader, main songwriter, and singer has been Hardi Volmer. The main themes in the band's songs are social-critical irony and humour.
