The Order of Freedom and Independence (Korean: 자유독립훈장) is one of the highest North Korean orders. It is divided into two classes: the first class is awarded to commanders and partisan units of brigades, divisions, and higher military groups for bravery, courage, and auspicious command of military operations. The second class is awarded to the commanders of partisan regiments, battalions, companies, and detachments, as well as to civil professionals employed in the industry for the military. The order is awarded with the Order of the National Flag of the same rank.
The order was instituted on 7 July 1950, during the Korean War.
Two variants have been made: one Soviet-made with a twisting mechanism for attachment and a North Korean-made with a pin.
