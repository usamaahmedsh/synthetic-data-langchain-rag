== In literature ==
The epic construction of the Bratsk Dam  is the subject of a long eponymous poem by Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Much later (1976), the impact of the reservoir construction on the life of the villagers upstream, many of whom had to be relocated from the flooded areas, or lost some the best lands of their collective farms, became the motive of Valentin Rasputin's novel Farewell to Matyora.
