The 2007 Zasyadko mine disaster was a mining accident that happened on November 18, 2007 at the Zasyadko coal mine (Ukrainian: Шахта ім. Засядько) in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk.
By November 30, 101 miners were reported dead:
the worst accident in Ukraine's history. At the time of the explosion, 457 miners were in the complex.


== Causes and investigation ==
A methane explosion occurred more than 1,000 metres (3,281 ft) below ground level.
The Zasyadko Mine is considered one of the most dangerous coal mines in the world, An independent mining expert recently claimed that the company management, linked to a powerful local clan, interferes with hazard-measuring equipment on a permanent basis, in order to present underground situation as being within the safety standards, and so to prevent production from closure by the government inspectors. President Viktor Yushchenko blamed the cabinet for failing to “implement safe mining practices” in the coal industry. A criminal investigation is also underway.


== Government reaction ==
Families of the deceased miners were to receive compensations totaling ₴100,000, (approx. $20,000 USD) which constitutes part of the ₴15 million that the Government of Ukraine had set aside for renovation of the mine to prevent future accidents from happening.
On November 19, 2007, President Viktor Yushchenko signed a decree that calls for investigation into Zasyadko mine disaster as well as prevention of such disasters in the future. The President also signed a decree making November 20 a Day of National Mourning.
