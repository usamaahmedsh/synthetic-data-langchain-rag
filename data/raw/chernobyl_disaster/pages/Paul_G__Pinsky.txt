Paul G. Pinsky (born March 5, 1950) is an American educator and politician who served as the Director of the Maryland Energy Administration from 2023 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served in the Maryland Senate from 1994 to 2023, and the Maryland House of Delegates from 1987 to 1994, representing District 22 in Prince George's County.


== Early life and education ==
Pinsky was born in Camden, New Jersey on March 5, 1950, where he attended Moorestown Friends School. He left New Jersey to attend George Washington University in Washington, D.C., where he earned a B.A. degree in public affairs in 1972. While at GWU, Pinsky attended protests in Washington, D.C. that opposed the Vietnam War and the apartheid in South Africa and supporting women's rights. He and his wife attended a national labor demonstration in the 1980s. After graduating, Pinsky worked as an educator for Prince George's County Public Schools from 1976 to 1995 and worked as an organizer for the Maryland State Teachers Association until 2014. From 1983 to 1987, he served as president of the Prince George's County Educators' Association, a labor union that represents over 6,000 professional school employees.
Pinsky has been a member of Progressive Maryland since 2001.


== Maryland General Assembly ==

Pinsky was a member of the Maryland General Assembly from 1987 to 2023, first being elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1986, after defeating incumbent David Bird in the Democratic primary election.
In 1990, after Burlington mayor Bernie Sanders was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Pinsky was one of a handful of progressives asked to organize a "Welcome to D.C. " event for Sanders. Pinsky later served as a delegate to the 2016 Democratic National Convention, pledged to Sanders.
In 1994, Pinsky challenged incumbent Democratic senator Thomas P. O'Reilly. During the primary election, O'Reilly resigned from the state senate to take an appointed post on the state Workers' Compensation Commission. Following his resignation, Democratic Party officials and aides of Senate President Thomas V. "Mike" Miller sought to appoint someone other than Pinsky to fill his vacancy, worrying that he would be "too liberal" and not enough of a team player. Pinsky was appointed to serve the rest of his term. He defeated Hyattsville city councilmember Charles J. Kenny Jr. in the Democratic primary, receiving 74 percent of the vote.
Pinsky was a member of the Maryland Senate from 1994 to 2023. At the time of his resignation in January 2023, he was the longest serving member of the Maryland Senate. Following the resignation of Senate President Thomas Miller in October 2019, Pinsky explored a run for senate president.
In February 2019, Maryland Republicans condemned comments made by Pinsky during a debate on a bill that would return control of school calendars to local school boards as an effort to link governor Larry Hogan to former Alabama governor George Wallace. In an interview later, Pinsky said that he had nothing to apologize for, saying "If the senator conjures something in his head, so be it."

In November 2025, Pinsky announced that he would step down from his role at the end of the month.

The bill passed and became law following a gubernatorial veto override on December 6, 2021.


=== Education ===

During the 2019 legislative session, Pinsky led a three-year effort of getting the Maryland General Assembly to pass the Kirwan Commission's reforms of public schools. In February, Pinsky voted down a bill that would expand the number of schools that can participate in the state's P-TECH program, saying that the program needed to be studied more before it could be expanded. He also supported a bill that would overturn Governor Hogan's mandate requiring schools to start after Labor Day. In April, he supported a bill that would provide an additional $700 million in funding for Maryland public schools over two years.
Pinsky introduced legislation in the 2022 legislative session that would ensure access to high-quality course and extracurricular offerings to students of virtual schools, requires teachers of a virtual class to be employees of the county, and cap the number of students from a single school to attend the county's virtual school to 10 percent.

During the 2021 special legislative session, Pinsky dismissed criticisms from Republicans that accused Maryland Democrats of passing congressional maps of using gerrymandering to draw a map that heavily favors the Democrats, saying that if Republicans opposed gerrymandering, they should support the federal For the People Act. In August 2021, Pinsky attended a rally outside the U.S. Capitol with hundreds of state legislators to pressure the United States Senate to pass the For the People Act.
During the 2022 legislative session, Pinsky introduced legislation that would give candidates the option of receiving public contributions from the state's Fair Campaign Financing Fund if they meet certain low-dollar fundraising thresholds and agree to spending limitations. He also supported legislation that would require vacancies in the Maryland General Assembly to be filled using special elections instead of gubernatorial appointments.


=== Environment ===
In 2008, Pinsky introduced the Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires that greenhouse gases be cut by 90 percent from all businesses in the state by 2050. An amendment introduced by senator Nathaniel Exum and backed by the administration of Governor Martin O'Malley weakened the bill's function by making this an advisory goal.
In 2011, Pinsky was arrested at a civil disobedience protest in front of the White House against the construction of an oil pipeline.
In 2016, Pinsky introduced the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act, which requires the state to cut its greenhouse gases by 40 percent of its 2006 levels by 2030. The bill passed and was signed into law by Governor Hogan on April 13, 2016.
In 2017, Pinsky attended an activist rally outside of the Maryland State House to promote legislation that would ban hydraulic fracking in Maryland.
In 2021, Pinsky introduced the Climate Solutions Now Act, which would increase the state's goal of cutting carbon emissions from a 40 percent reduction from its 2006 levels to a 60 percent cut by 2030. He was critical of an amended version of the bill that reduced the reduction goal to 50 percent introduced by leaders of the Maryland House of Delegates, arguing that the changes "reflect a lack of urgency the leadership in the House of Delegates feels about confronting climate change". After negotiations on Pinsky's bill broke down in the final weeks of the legislative session, Pinsky tried to tack the bill's priorities onto other separate bills. Negotiations on a climate bill continued following the end of the legislative session. Pinsky reintroduced the legislation during the 2022 legislative session, promising alongside delegate Kumar Barve to move quickly on passing the bill to override a gubernatorial veto.
On its 2021 legislative scorecard, the Maryland League of Conservation Voters gave Pinsky a score of 100 percent.
Pinsky is a skeptic of nuclear energy, saying that living through scares like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island has made him unsure of its safety.

=== Gambling ===
In 1987, Pinsky voted against legislation that would return slot machines to eight counties on the Eastern Shore of Maryland under the pretext that they were only used by nonprofit organizations for charitable purposes. In 2003, Pinsky opposed a bill that would legalize slot machines in Maryland and earmark almost half of the revenue for public education, arguing that the track owners' share of the profit was far too generous. In 2012, Pinsky opposed legislation that allow a new casino in Prince George's County and add Las Vegas-style table games at Maryland's five other slots venues, saying that he thinks the county should focus its economic development efforts elsewhere.


=== Guns ===

=== Social issues ===
