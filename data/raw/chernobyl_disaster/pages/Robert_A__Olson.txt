Robert August Olson (April 14, 1917 – July 18, 1987) was an American soil scientist.  He was a professor of agronomy at the University of Nebraska, and one of the first to prove and warn that nitrogen fertilizers could harm crops and pollute groundwater.


== Education and career ==
Olson was born in Fullerton, Nebraska, and grew up in eastern Nebraska.  He was educated at the University of Nebraska, where he received an AB in chemistry and soils, and after service as a naval air navigator during World War II, an MS degree in soils.  His MS thesis was titled The Relation of Soil Properties and Fertilization to Winter Wheat Production in Nebraska, and was advised by R. H. Rhoades.  Upon completion of the master's degree, he was hired in 1948 as a professor of agronomy at the same university, where he remained for most of his career.  He retired and was granted emeritus status in 1986.
Other than teaching at the University of Nebraska–, Olson served as a consultant at the OECD in Paris in 1958 and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in 1962. Between 1967 and 1969 he served as manager of the Food for Hunger Campaign Fertilizer Program for the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.  After the Chernobyl disaster, he helped assess and mitigate the effects of the disaster on agriculture.
He authored over 100 topical publications and book chapters and was associate editor of Soil Science Society of America Journal and soils editor of Agronomy Journal.
