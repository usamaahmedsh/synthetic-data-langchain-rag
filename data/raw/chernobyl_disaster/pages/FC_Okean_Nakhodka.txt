Okean Nakhodka was a Russian football club based in Nakhodka, Primorsky Krai. The club's colours were white and blue.


== History ==
In 1989 Okean won the RSFSR Cup, and in 1991 they won the regional league.
Okean spent 1992 and 1993 seasons in the Top League, being one of the founding members, aided by the fact that the clubs from other Soviet republics walked away from the existing Soviet league system to form their own leagues. They thus became the easternmost club to compete in the Top League (and by extension, all of Europe's top flight leagues, though they never made any European competition), a record they hold until 2017 (when SKA-Khabarovsk won promotion to the top tier of Russian football). The best result they achieved was a 14th position in 1992.
After relegation in 1993 Okean played in the First League in 1994–1996, after which they were relegated again.
Okean played in the Second Division after 1997. The best result was achieved in 2005, when they finished as runners-up. In 2010 they finished 11th or last in East Zone of Second Division and were relegated to the Amateur Football League for 2011, losing professional status.
The club was liquidated in 2015.
