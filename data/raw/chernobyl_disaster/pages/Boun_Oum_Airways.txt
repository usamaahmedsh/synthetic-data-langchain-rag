Boun Oum Airways or BOA, was a Laotian airline owned by Prince Boun Oum. After 1965 BOA expanded using aircraft on loan from Continental Air Services, Inc (CASI). BOA's aircraft did not carry any logo or titles and their Thai pilots were integrated with CASI by early 1967.


== History ==
The CIA created BOA in 1964 by using resources from both Air America and Bird & Son. BOA was ostensibly owned by Prince Boun Oum of Laos and was created with the intention of flying missions in Laos with Asian crews (as opposed to Caucasian crews) allegedly for plausible deniability. BOA was based at Savannakhet, Laos.
Boum Oum Airlines (sic) reportedly lost two Dornier Do28s on 12/03/67 and in 05/67.
Due to its high aircraft loss rate, BOA was fully integrated into the CASI by mid-1967 and officially ceased to exist.
