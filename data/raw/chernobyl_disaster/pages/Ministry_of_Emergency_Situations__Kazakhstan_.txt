The Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Kazakhstan (EMER), formerly known as the Committee for Emergency Situations of Kazakhstan and also known as the EMERCOM of Kazakhstan, is a government agency overseeing emergency services in Kazakhstan. It is responsible for handling emergencies and natural disasters in Kazakhstan.


== History ==


=== Soviet era ===
Taking into account the lessons of the Chernobyl disaster in 1988, the Soviet Council of Ministers created the Permanent emergency Commission of the USSR on elimination of consequences of accidents and natural disasters. Accordingly, the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR on 17 February 1988 established the Permanent Emergency Commission under the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR. Its members included the heads of ministries and departments, major national organizations. 


=== Nationalization ===
On 24 October 1989, the Council of Ministers transformed the Commission into the Commission of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR for Emergency Situations. President Nursultan Nazarbayev on 21 August recognized the commission as one of the factors of national security. The post of Chairman of EMERCOM was introduced in the Security Council of Kazakhstan and the cabinet, and his/her position is equated to the post of Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Earlier that June, the regulations of the commission were approved by the government. On 6 August 2014, the ministry was downgraded to the committee level, with its authority being transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan, with the exception of issues of material reserve and industrial safety. By decree of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on 9 September 2020, it became a separate department within the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The governmental body changed its status since it gained its independence from USSR. Until now, there have been 8 ministers of the Ministry, with one of them appointed to this position twice.
