The Spanish Small Temple (Romanian: Templul Mic Spaniol), also known as the Ca'al Cicu, was a former Jewish congregation and synagogue, located at 37 Banu Maracine Street, in Bucharest, Romania. The synagogue was completed in 1846 and demolished in 1986.

The building was devastated by the far-right Legionaries in 1941. The synagogue was rebuilt after World War II; however, in 1986, along with the Malbim Synagogue and other synagogues, and many other houses, including historical Christian churches, the building was demolished to make room for the Union Boulevard in Bucharest.
