He was sentenced to two years in prison in 1997 for corruption and misuse of defense ministry funds. Before his arrest, he was often called one of the most likely candidates for the post of Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. On the other hand, his name was constantly at the center of various corruption scandals. Communists and ultra-nationalists strongly disliked him for his adherence to the course of the President of the Russian Federation B. N. Yeltsin: in August 1991, he led the so-called defense of the “White House”, and in October 1993, on the contrary, he collected tankers to storm the White House.
