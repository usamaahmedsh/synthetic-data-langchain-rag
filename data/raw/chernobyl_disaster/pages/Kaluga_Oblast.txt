== History ==
The territory of Kaluga Oblast has been inhabited since ancient times. Through the province of Kaluga flows the Tarusa River, which could give an indication of the history and origin of the Russian people. The oldest human sites discovered by archeologists date back to the Mesolithic period (10,000–6,000 BC). The first mentions of Kaluga's towns are associated with events in the 12th century, specifically, the feudal war between the Olegovichi and the Monomakhovichi (Kozelsk —  1146, Serensk —  1147, Vorotynsk —  1155, Mosalsk —  1231).
In the 14th century, Kaluga lands were places of constant confrontations between Lithuania and Moscow. Traditionally, it is considered that Kaluga was established as a frontier settlement to protect the Moscow principality from Lithuania's attacks. Around half of the current province with the western and southern parts and the towns of Kozelsk, Mosalsk, Meshchovsk, Serpeysk, Peremyshl and Vorotynsk were part of Lithuania in the late 14th-15th centuries.

Between 1480–1481, Kaluga's territory was the place of the Great Stand on the Ugra River, resulting in the liberation of Russian lands from the Tatar yoke, and Moscow's transformation into a sovereign state.
In the 16th and 17th centuries, with active development of trade and crafts, the city advanced in the arts of wood-carving and jewelry-making. After the formal [[Pereiaslav Agreement
|union of Russia and Ukraine established]] in 1654, Kaluga's role as a trade intermediary between Moscow and Ukraine contributed also to its economic development.
On August 24, 1776, Catherine the Great issued a decree establishing Kaluga Viceroyalty to unite the Kaluga and Tula Governorates. The center of the viceroyalty acquired a new image. In 1795, during the rule of Paul I, the Kaluga Viceroyalty was transformed into a governorate.
During World War II, Kozelsk housed a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp for Poles, captured during the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, who were then murdered in the Katyn massacre in 1940. In 1941, the territory was captured by Nazi Germany, and then was liberated from German occupation by the Soviet Army's 10th, 16th, 33rd, 43rd, 49th, 50th, and 61st Armies, the 20th Tank Brigade, 1st Air Army, 1st Cavalry Corps, and the Normandy squadron.
The modern oblast was founded in accordance with the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on July 5, 1944. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kaluga Oblast became a federal subject of the Russian Federation. In March 1996, the Charter of Kaluga Oblast was adopted.
