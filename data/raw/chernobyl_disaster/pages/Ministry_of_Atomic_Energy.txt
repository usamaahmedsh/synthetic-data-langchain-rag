The Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom; Russian: Министерство атомной энергетики СССР) was a government ministry in the Soviet Union.
Created soon after the Chernobyl disaster, the ministry assumed responsibility for all nuclear energy in the USSR while the control of individual atomic stations remained with the State Committee for the Utilization of Atomic Energy (GKAE).
