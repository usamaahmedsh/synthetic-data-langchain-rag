St. Andrew Memorial Church (Ukrainian: Церква‑пам’ятник Святого Андрія Первозванного) is a Ukrainian Orthodox cathedral in South Bound Brook, New Jersey. It is the mother church of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA and was built as a memorial to victims of the Holodomor, the Stalin‑era famine of 1932–33, and to all Ukrainians who died fighting for liberty and national independence. The church stands at the centre of a 100‑acre Metropolia Centre that houses the church’s administrative offices, St. Sophia Seminary, a library and archive, museums, and St. Andrew Cemetery.


== History ==
The memorial church was conceived by Archbishop Mstyslav (Skrypnyk), who later became the first Patriarch of Kyiv and All Ukraine. During the Second World War he lamented the destruction of churches and cemeteries in Soviet Ukraine and proposed building a memorial church in the diaspora to honour the dead. In 1950 the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA acquired land in Somerset County for a new Metropolia Centre. Ukrainian‑Canadian architect George Kodak (also known as Yurii Kodak) was commissioned to design a Cossack Baroque structure inspired by St. Andrew's Church, Kyiv. Ground‑breaking took place on July 21, 1955; the first burial in the cemetery occurred in 1964, and the church was consecrated on October 10, 1965.


== Architecture and interior ==

St. Andrew Memorial Church is a three‑domed structure built in the Ukrainian Cossack Baroque style. Its tall, slender silhouette evokes the churches of eighteenth‑century central Ukraine. The iconostasis separating the sanctuary from the nave was carved and painted by the Ukrainian artist Petro Cholodny, and the interior was decorated in 1980 and again in 1996 by artist Boris Makarenko. Additional mosaics and icons by Petro Cholodny the Younger and woodcarvings by Andreas Darahan adorn the interior.


== Grounds and facilities ==
The cathedral occupies the centre of a campus that includes administrative offices, a seminary, library and museum facilities, and St. Andrew Cemetery. Between the church and the historic Fisher House is the Holy Transfiguration Chapel and an Apostolic Prayer Trail of fifteen icons representing the twelve apostles, St. Paul, St. Volodymyr the Great, St. Olha and the Transfiguration; the trail and chapel were blessed on September 28, 2002 during the fiftieth anniversary of the property’s purchase.  

Behind the church stands the Holy Resurrection Mausoleum, designed by Archbishop Mstyslav and architect Yurii Kodak‑Vasylchenko. It temporarily housed the church museum for 35 years before construction resumed in 2000; the mausoleum was officially dedicated on St. Thomas Sunday (April 22, 2001). The crypt of Patriarch Mstyslav I is located beneath the altar and is surrounded by crypts for clergy and prominent lay leaders.


== Monuments and memorials ==
Several monuments stand on the church grounds:

The Metropolitan Vasyl Lypkivsky Monument is a bronze statue honouring Metropolitan Vasyl Lypkivsky; it was designed by sculptor Petro Kapschutschenko and dedicated on October 23, 1983.
The St. Olha Monument, erected on August 16, 1987 by the United Ukrainian Orthodox Sisterhoods, commemorates St. Olha as “Equal to the Apostles” and was also sculpted by Kapschutschenko.
A Memorial to the Victims of the Holodomor–Famine was established in 2004 to commemorate the women and children who perished in the 1932–33 famine.
The Ukrainian‑American Veterans National Monument was dedicated on October 3, 2015. Designed by sculptor John Jaciw, it consists of two granite pillars and honours Americans of Ukrainian descent who served in the U.S. Armed Forces.
The Great Memorial Cross in the cemetery is a ten‑metre‑high white granite cross designed by Petro Cholodny Jr. It bears the state coat of arms of Ukraine and the insignia of the Ukrainian army; at its base lies the original grave plate of Symon Petliura, transferred from Paris in 1970.


== Community and events ==
St. Andrew Memorial Church functions as the spiritual heart of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA. The parish choir, under the direction of Dr. Michael Andrec, sings ancient Kyivan chants and music by Ukrainian composers. The Sisterhood of the Protection of the Mother of God supports parish life through food sales, catering and charitable work.
Thousands of pilgrims visit the Metropolia Centre each year on the first Sunday after Easter (St Thomas Sunday) to honour victims of the Holodomor, the Chernobyl disaster and those who died defending Ukraine and the United States. After the Divine Liturgy, clergy and faithful process to the Great Memorial Cross for a memorial service before visiting family graves. In August 2025 the cathedral hosted a Divine Liturgy marking the 34th anniversary of Ukraine’s independence; the service, presided over by Archbishop Daniel and Metropolitan Antony, included memorial prayers for fallen soldiers and was concelebrated by the newly appointed pastor, Very Rev. Vasyl Pasakas, and Protopresbyter Emeritus Yuriy Siwko. The community also observes the feast of the Prophet Elijah by blessing vehicles; in 2025 more than one hundred cars and motorcycles were blessed on the church grounds.


== St. Andrew Cemetery ==

St Andrew Cemetery, located behind the church, is the largest predominantly Ukrainian cemetery in the United States. Dedicated in 1954, it covers much of the Metropolia’s 100 acre property and contains more than 8,000 burials, including bishops, clergy, soldiers, politicians and cultural leaders of the Ukrainian diaspora. A section of the cemetery holds the graves of twelve hierarchs of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA, including Patriarch Mstyslav; another section contains memorials to political leaders Andriy Livytsky and Stepan Vytvytsky and human‑rights advocate Pyotr Grigorenko. The cemetery also includes plots belonging to the Fisher, La Tourette and Van Nortwick families; Hendrick Fisher, whose family farm originally occupied the site, brought the first copy of the Declaration of Independence to Somerset County and read it publicly on July 7, 1776.
