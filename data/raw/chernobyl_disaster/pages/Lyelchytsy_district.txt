== History ==
The district was created on 17 July 1924 during early Soviet administrative reforms and frequently changed status in the first three decades of its existence. Originally formed from the Buynavichy and Lyelchytsy townships (volosts) of the abolished Mazyr Uyezd, the district belonged to the newly established Mazyr Okrug of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR) until 1930, when Mazyr Okrug was dissolved. From 1930 to 1935 the district was a first-order subdivision of the BSSR.
At the time of its creation in 1924, the district had 12 village councils, 147 settlements, 4,913 farms, and 27,664 residents. The village of Lyelchytsy contained 306 farms and 1,659 residents.
In 1935, the Mazyr Okrug was reinstated and Lyelchytsy rejoined. New administrative reforms in 1938 introducing regions dissolved Mazyr Okrug again, created the Polesia Region, and transferred Lyelchytsy to the new region. The settlement of Lyelchytsy was granted urban-type settlement status in 1938.
During the German occupation of World War II from 1941 to 1944, the district was annexed to the Reichskommissariat Ukraine with its administrative center in Rivne. After the war, the district returned to Polesia Region, to which it remained until 1954, when the present-day Gomel Region was created.
The district was dissolved for several years in the 1960s, being abolished in December 1962 and reinstated in January 1965. It has been a district of Belarus since its independence from the USSR in 1991.

It is bordered in the north by Zhytkavichy and Pyetrykaw districts, in the east by Mazyr and Yelsk districts, in the west by Stolin district of Brest region, and in the south by the Zhytomyr and Rivne oblasts of Ukraine.

The district's population has been in decline since the 1970s, though the urban settlement of Lyelchytsy has grown over the same period.
