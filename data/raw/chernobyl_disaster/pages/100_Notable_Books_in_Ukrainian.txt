The list of the 100 Notable Books in Ukrainian 'From Skovoroda to the Present Day' was compiled in 2019 by members of PEN Ukraine and the online magazine The Ukrainians to show the abundance and genre variety of Ukrainian literature and draw attention to significant works which, due to certain reasons, were forgotten or little known.
All works are characterised by a particular authorial style, offer new ideas and meanings and influence the development of the Ukrainian language and the formation of Ukraine. The list includes works in Ukrainian written between the 18th and 21st centuries. The list includes poetry, prose, drama, essays and memoirs, but excludes academic editions. A work is a novel, story, novella, short story, poem, as well as collections of stories, novels and poems, established by an author as one complete work. Each author is represented on the list with only one work.
The authors of the list emphasise that this list is not a canon of Ukrainian literature, as it does not represent a large and important layer of ancient literature, as well as works in other languages, which are an important part of Ukrainian literature.
The list is sorted alphabetically by the author's surname in Ukrainian.
