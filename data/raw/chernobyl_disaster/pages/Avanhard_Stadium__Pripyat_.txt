Avanhard Stadium (Ukrainian: Стадіон «Авангард») is an abandoned football stadium in Pripyat, Ukraine. It was built to become the home ground of FC Stroitel Pripyat. Due to the Chernobyl disaster it was never realized. It was named, like several other grounds, after the Ukrainian sports society trade union. The town of Pripyat was evacuated following the Chernobyl disaster on 26 April 1986, which occurred a few kilometers away.
