== Benjy Parker ==
Benjamin Richard Parker (often called Benjy by his sister) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is from the alternate future MC2 universe, and is the younger brother of Mayday Parker / Spider-Girl, and son of Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker / Spider-Man.
Benjamin was born after a complicated pregnancy. Because of his father's artificially altered genetic code, Ben was at a high risk of being born with some kind of genetic abnormality: deformity, disability, or perhaps even mutant powers. Due to the risk to Mary Jane's health, her obstetrician advised her to consider abortion. However, remembering that she faced similar risks when pregnant with her daughter May, Mary Jane decided to proceed with the pregnancy. Ben was born while his sister fought Seth, and to his family's relief, was apparently a perfectly healthy, normal little boy. He was named Benjamin in honor of his uncle Ben Reilly and great-uncle Ben Parker, while his second name, Richard, is in honor of his grandfather Richard Parker.
Benjamin seems to display some superhuman abilities. He is able to balance a block toy while simultaneously spinning his arm quickly. He is also seen dangling the block from his finger on a web-like string.  May discovers Ben crawling on the ceiling of their home. He is once possessed by a miniature version of the Carnage symbiote.  After his sister frees him from the symbiote by using the ultrasonic weaponry of the villain Reverb, his father notices that the baby's ears are bleeding, and realizes that Ben lost his hearing, likely because Ben's ears are far too underdeveloped to withstand the sonic waves. The doctors in the hospital try to determine whether Ben's hearing loss is permanent. May is deeply upset over this and blames herself. Nevertheless, Ben still seems to be his usual, happy self. Since discovering her baby brother crawling on the ceiling, she fears that due to his exposure to the symbiote, his abilities were somehow activated early (as hers only came about in her teens).
Normie Osborn agrees to fund an operation to restore Benjamin's hearing. The procedure is successful, giving him most or all of his hearing back. Normie carefully studies Benjy's body as he goes through it and discovers that while he was already developing his abilities, the symbiote exposure sped up the process. Peter begins to fear that Benjamin may be more powerful than he and his sister. This is strongly implied to be true when Ben spins organic webs to save both himself and Mary Jane after being thrown off a bridge by the Green Goblin, something neither Peter nor May can do. Despite being a baby, he is also strong enough for Mary Jane to hold on to without hurting him.
In the 2014/2015 crossover event Spider-Verse, Benjy's family is under attack from Daemos, a relation of the 616 Spider-Man's former nemesis Morlun. During the attack, Mary Jane, Mayday's boyfriend Wes, and Peter are apparently all killed and their home destroyed. Mayday flees with Ben and is rescued by visiting Spider-Men from other dimensions who are trying to save as many Spiders as possible from similar attacks by Morlun and Daemos' family, who call themselves "The Inheritors". Mayday and Ben are taken to a safe zone where the Spiders plan their next course of action. The safe zone is eventually compromised and Ben is captured by The Inheritors. It is revealed that Ben is vital part of a prophecy that will help bring about the downfall of The Inheritors and involves "The Other" (Kaine), "The Bride" (Silk) and "The Scion" (Ben himself). Benjy is eventually saved by Ben Parker- his great-uncle, and Spider-Ham. In the final fight, uncle Ben takes Benjy to safety and Spider-Ham takes Benjy's place to catch the Inheritors off-guard. Afterwards, it is revealed Benjamin's mother and Wes survived the Inheritor attack, but unfortunately, his father did not. Benjamin makes a few cameo appearances in 2015's Web Warriors series, looked after by Mayday, Mary Jane, Uncle Ben and often visited by Anya Corazon. Benjamin is referenced several times by his sister Mayday in the event Spider-Geddon. After the latest battle with The Inheritors concludes, Mayday comments that her brother is very likely still the Scion of the Spider-Scroll Prophecy. Her alternate world sister Annie May Parker, Spiderling, informs her that The Other is still in play too and is closer than she knows. On Mayday and Benjamin's Earth, it is revealed that The Other resurrected their father.

== Teresa Parker ==
Teresa Parker (also addressed to as Teresa Durand) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man: Family Business #1 (April 2014). She is the long lost younger sister of Peter Parker / Spider-Man and daughter of Richard and Mary Parker.
After their parents' deaths, Peter was sent to live with their Aunt May and Uncle Ben while Teresa, whose birth had been kept a secret, was adopted. Many years later, Teresa was personally recruited into the C.I.A. by Nick Fury. Teresa first came into Peter's life after saving the latter from several mysterious gunmen sent by the Kingpin. Following this adventure, Teresa left the C.I.A. to join a S.H.I.E.L.D. division called the Gray Blade under Nick Fury Jr., specializing in international hostage rescues and intel gathering, before becoming a fugitive after learning of a program named "Project Twilight", an exhaustive plan to take down both superheroes and supervillains. After deleting all traces of the project from Gray Blade's systems and hiding the only known backup in nanobots in her bloodstream, Teresa sought Peter's assistance in confronting the Kingpin once again, who was involved in the operation. Later on, she helped Spider-Man stop an attack by the Vulture. Since Teresa had been spotted by Gray Blade operatives with Spider-Man, they arrested Peter himself due to his alter-ego being supposedly a bodyguard. When Peter then attempts to get Teresa out of New York, they are attacked by numerous criminals sent by the Tinkerer, ahead of an alien armada.
After traveling to the past of an alternate timeline, to retrieve information to stop the coming invasion, Teresa joined Peter in this journey, contacting Fury and confirming that she was in fact the Parkers' daughter and Peter's sister. After returning to find an alternate timeline where Peter quit being Spider-Man, Teresa joins forces with Peter in restoring the correct timeline. Peter then-after finally introduces Teresa to Aunt May. Months later, her S.H.I.E.L.D. partner and lover David Albright is apparently been tortured and murdered by the Chameleon for information, then-after which point Teresa seeks Peter's help to help find, intercepted a meeting with Foreigner, whom had used Albright's information to acquire doses of the Infinity Formula to help Silver Sable's efforts to save Symkaria from its newest civil war. Despite learning of the Chameleon's noble motives and Albright's corruption, Teresa flees in pursuit, leaving Peter alone, apprehending Chameleon after the fall of Doctor Doom.
Teresa later visits Chameleon at the prison he is serving time in, and discovers he was one of many similar agents trained in a special facility by the Finisher, the man who arranged the murder of Richard and Mary Parker. It is implied in the ensuing conversation that Teresa may be a Chameleon agent herself. The Finisher offers to reveal to Teresa the truth of her own origins, provided that she delivers a clairvoyant device to him that Peter had helped develop. Fearing that she is not truly a Parker, Teresa is tempted, but ultimately decides to embrace who she believes herself to be and destroys the Clairvoyant when Peter entrusts her with it, keeping it out of The Finisher's hands.


== Pathway ==
Pathway (Laura Dean) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She first appeared in Alpha Flight #48 (July 1987), and was created by Bill Mantlo and Jim Lee.
Laura Dean's parents were mutant-phobic and decided to abort Laura's twin fetus because it was a mutant. While still a fetus, Laura protected her twin sister by using her mutant abilities to send her to another dimension, dubbed "Liveworld".
Laura grew up withdrawn from the world. In an attempt to cure her, her parents sent her to the New Life Clinic, which was actually run by the villain Scramble. Laura managed to escape but was later caught by Bedlam and forced to become a member of his team of Derangers. During the clash with Alpha Flight, Laura swapped places with her twin, whom she had named Goblyn, in Liveworld.
After Alpha Flight defeated Bedlam, Goblyn and Laura were admitted into Beta Flight under the misbelief that they were the same person. However, this was sorted out when Alpha Flight travelled to Liveworld and there encountered the Dreamqueen. When they returned to Earth, and Alpha disbanded, Laura and Goblyn went to live with Purple Girl.
They re-joined Beta Flight when Talisman dispatched them on a quest for Northstar, thanks to Laura's ability to open portals to other dimensions. The two stayed on when the team was once again funded by the government and Department H was re-formed. However, both were severely injured when Wild Child went insane and attacked them. Laura sent Goblyn instinctively to Liveworld and had to return with Beta Flight to save her.

== Perun ==
Perun (Valeri Sovloyev) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in Captain America #352 (April 1989) and was created by Mark Gruenwald and Kieron Dwyer.
Perun is a Russian superhero who serves in Russia's government-sponsored super-team, the Winter Guard, alongside Fantasma, the Red Guardian, Vostok, and Crimson Dynamo. He wears a helmet and red cloak similar to those of Thor. He had long hair and a beard, with a great deal of body hair. Perun is an avatar of the Slavic god Perun inhabiting the body of Valeri Sovloyev.
Perun evidently first joined the Russian super-team when it was known as the Supreme Soviets. When the Soviets attacked their predecessors, the Soviet Super Soldiers, Perun is disguised as Thor with Fantasma's magic and nearly kills Ursa Major with his lightning.
Perun and his team, subsequently renamed the People's Protectorate, are featured in The Avengers, working with the Canadian Alpha Flight and the American Avengers.
Perun and his team, now called the Winter Guard (a name it has retained ever since), come into conflict with the Hulk and the Pantheon over the kidnapping of Igor Drenkov, a Russian spy. The Hulk believes Drenkov to have been responsible for his, the Hulk's, creation. Drenkov is put through a re-creation of the incident, which causes great distress. The Hulk easily defeats Perun and takes his weapons, using them to temporarily entrap Vostok. The confrontation ends in a stalemate, for Drenkov had gone mad with guilt and nobody was sure what to do.
When a group of aliens calling themselves Starblasters tries to push the moon away from Earth, Quasar assembles a group with some of the most powerful heroes of the world, recruiting Perun, Carol Danvers, Black Bolt, Hyperion, Ikaris, Darkstar, Vanguard and Monica Rambeau.
Perun and fellow Slavic god Chernobog later join the Winter Guard.


=== Ultimate Marvel version ===
In the Ultimate Marvel imprint, Perun is a member of the Liberators, described as a "Soviet Thor". His appearance is vastly different from his mainstream appearance; he is clean-shaven and has no visible head hair. His powers are seemingly derived from a force-belt similar to that of Thor. Like his mainstream counterpart, he carries a hammer and sickle (the latter of which was dropped by Gregory Stark for loss of Soviet symbolism, but decided to keep the hammer to be Fury's own Thor).
Perun was originally an unnamed soldier who was given the same equipment as Thor. Alongside the other members of the Liberators, Perun attacks and rapidly subdues the forces of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the weakened Ultimates. Strategic locales all across the United States are taken. The Liberators kill thousands of soldiers and citizens alike. Perun personally incapacitates Quicksilver with a lightning strike.
Perun and the Crimson Dynamo attack Air Force One capturing U.S. President George W. Bush. The plane and the passengers are brought back to the White House in Washington D.C. This is where most of Perun's teammates are killed in battle. He is seen wandering the streets, trying to find someone to surrender to.
Despite their invasion failing, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Nick Fury, and Dr. Gregory Stark decided to give Perun a second chance, instead of him being executed in his home country. Perun was spared a chance for Avengers operation, but is later killed by the vampiric Nerd Hulk (a clone of the Hulk) in Ultimate Avengers 3. His hammer is later used by Captain America in a last-ditch effort to save the Triskelion and its inhabitants, using the hammer to teleport it to Iran. With all the vampires dead thanks to sunlight, Captain America then beheads the vampiric Hulk clone in retribution.


== Pestilence ==
Pestilence is the name of several characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Some of them are members of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. 


=== Plague ===
Plague was originally a member of the Morlocks with disease-inducing abilities. She was saved from the Mutant Massacre by Apocalypse, and joined the Horsemen of Apocalypse, becoming Pestilence. The character was created by Chris Claremont and Paul Smith and first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #169 (February 1983).
She fell to her death after Molecula accidentally knocked her off her flying steed.


=== F.R. Crozier ===

This Pestilence is an adaptation of Francis Crozier, an Ulsterman who was second in command in John Franklin's expedition to the Northwest Passage and later disappeared after taking command of the expedition from Franklin.
In 1845, F.R. Crozier was appointed doctor and chief science officer for an Arctic expedition for the fabled Northwest Passage. Six months after the departure of the expedition, the ships became trapped in ice. The captain set forth with a party in search of help and was never seen again. Crozier led the remainder over the ice, only for much of the crew to die of exposure. Crozier ingested an elixir he had prepared before, which induced a state of suspended animation that his men mistook for death. His plan was to remain where he fell, allowing the ice to preserve him until the weather warmed enough to revive him, however, his remaining crew buried him and he was trapped in permafrost for 148 years, while conscious.
When the demigoddess Snowbird was pregnant with her first child and Shaman used his power to beseech spirits for a place of power for the birth, he came to Crozier's resting place. However, Shaman's vengeful daughter Talisman, under the corruption of her powers, had ordered the spirits to take them to a place of death. She wanted to show Shaman up through his failure to save Snowbird's child, and her triumph in binding the spirit. Snowbird's baby was possessed by Crozier, calling himself Pestilence. Talisman, however, was unable to control Pestilence as had never truly died. Pestilence attacked Alpha Flight and tore Talisman's mystical circlet from her head. Pestilence summoned the spirits of the Great Beasts to the battle, but was defeated by Shaman who had donned the circlet of power, becoming the new Talisman. Pestilence fled the battle. 
Pestilence went south, in possession of the baby, leaving behind him a trail of strange death, until he reached a mining town in Klondike. He was followed by the child's father, Douglas Thompson, who also died of Pestilence's plague, just before he told Snowbird and Talisman about his location. Alpha Flight again battled Pestilence, until he seized control of Snowbird in the form of Sasquatch, forcing her to kill him, releasing Pestilence to seek another host body. In trying to keep Snowbird from being possessed, Vindicator slew Snowbird, but was too late, as, after Snowbird's and her family's funeral, Pestilence rose from Snowbird's grave, and again attacked Alpha Flight. When hard-pressed, Pestilence's spirit tried to possess yet another, but this time Vindicator was able to trap his spirit in the void held within the medicine bag formerly belonging to Shaman.
It is later revealed that Pestilence had found a new host, but he was caught in "some sort of disintegrator blast".
Pestilence had a number of supernatural abilities of unknown origin, perhaps deriving from his being buried at a place of power for over a century . He had the power to spontaneously generate life forms symbolic of disease and death, including maggots and flies. He could control the spirits of the dead, transform his appearance into that of other people, generate disease, cause instantaneous but temporary rapid aging and had the power to draw upon the "bodily decay" of other living beings to rejuvenate himself. Pestilence had extensive knowledge of chemistry beyond what was commonly known in the 19th century.

== Petra ==

Petra is a fictional character appearing in the comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appears in the limited series X-Men: Deadly Genesis #1 (November 2005), and was created by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Pete Woods. She is one of the "Missing X-Men".
Petra was the first of her family to be born in the United States. Her mother, father and brother emigrated from Denmark while the former was pregnant with her. They lived the typical American life in the suburbs of New York City for most of her childhood. Shortly after her thirteenth birthday, Petra's family was killed by a rockslide while on a camping trip, and Petra unknowingly used her mutant powers of earth manipulation to avoid getting hurt. After spending weeks in Child Protective Services, Petra was sent to live in New Jersey in a foster home. She was placed in a home that had five other children that were forced to share the same bedroom. Her foster mother was old and uncaring, and her foster father was too caring while trying to hold and touch her all the time.
One day on an outing to Central Park, her foster father tried to touch her yet sank knee-deep into the ground. It was then that Petra realized that she was a mutant, and she ran away. She found a cave and hid there for days crying, knowing that with her abilities she could have either killed or saved her family. She camped in Central Park for a couple of years, using her power to manipulate rock caves into shelters to avoid being arrested and sent to juvenile detention centers. When she was sixteen, she discovered another useful aspect of her ability: she could turn coal into diamonds by concentrating hard enough. For a year, she used this aspect of her power to make diamonds of varying sizes to sell to pawn shops so she could buy food and survive. One day, however, a pawn shop employee said he was going to call the owner of the store, but he called the police.
Running to her rock shelter, the police found Petra before she could hide, and took her into custody after a brief battle. When she awoke, a female guard informed her that she was being released into the custody of Moira MacTaggert who was there to help Petra. This at first frightened Petra because she had never known anyone to try to help her because of her abilities, only hurt her. After some time with MacTaggert, Professor X took Petra alongside Sway, Darwin, and Vulcan to rescue the original X-Men team trapped on the mutant island Krakoa. Petra instinctively used her powers to bury Vulcan and Darwin, and then gets incinerated by a volcano creature created by Krakoa.
When the X-Men establish Krakoa as a mutant nation, Petra was among the mutants resurrected via Krakoa's resurrection protocols. She, Sway, and Vulcan are shown to reside in the Summer House.


=== Powers and abilities ===
Petra is a "terrakinetic" or "geo-morph", having the ability to psychokinetically manipulate, control, levitate and reshape the earth. She can use this power to cause minor earthquakes and create shapes out of solid rock.


=== Petra in other media ===
A character based on Petra named Christy Nord appears in Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Kari Wahlgren as an adult and Danielle Judovits as a child. This version is the geokinetic daughter of Christoph Nord who lives on a farm near the U.S.-Canadian border. In "Past Discretions", she attacks Wolverine under the belief that the latter killed her father before learning Wolverine was tasked by Weapon X to kidnap Christoph. Though he stopped upon realizing this would make Christy an orphan, Sabretooth completed the mission. In "Stolen Lives", Christy is abducted by a brainwashed Christoph before being rescued by Wolverine and Mystique. Emma Frost later undoes Christoph's brainwashing, allowing the Nords to reunite.

== Phobos ==

Phobos is the name of two fictional comic book characters appearing in books published by Marvel Comics characters, based on the Greek mythological deity of the same name. The first appeared in Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #32 (August 1991) in a story written by Roy Thomas and Jean-Marc Lofficier.
The second and current Phobos first appeared in the 2006 Ares: God of War mini-series (written by Michael Avon Oeming; art by Travel Foreman). He is the son of Ares, step-brother to Hippolyta, and a member of the Secret Warriors.
Due to the nature of gods in the Marvel Universe, in addition to the retcon surrounding the current Phobos (see below) the relationship between the two has not been explicitly explained.


=== Original ===
The original Phobos first appeared in the "A Gathering of Fear" storyline in Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #32 (August 1991) written by Roy Thomas and Jean-Marc Lofficier. He reappeared in "The Great Fear" storyline in DS:SS #39 (March 1992).
Phobos and his brother Deimos are sons of Ares and Nox (posing as Venus) but were killed by Thor and Hercules in their first appearance. Later the Fear Lords release so much fear that Nox is able to bring her sons back, creating them from the Darkforce but they were eventually defeated again. Phobos meets his final fate when Amatsu-Mikaboshi assaults Olympus and kills him.


=== Alexander ===
The current Phobos, Alexander, first appeared in the Ares limited series in 2006 written by Michael Avon Oeming. Here, he is manipulated by Amatsu-Mikaboshi into becoming a warrior until his father, Ares, saves him many years later, a young adult with god-like powers. This ending is ignored for future storyline purposes. The character returns, retconned by Brian Michael Bendis and reduced to a ten-year-old boy with no specialized training in Mighty Avengers #1, then reappears in the Secret Invasion crossover, in Mighty Avengers and the Secret Invasion limited series. Once Dark Reign started, he began appearing regularly in Secret Warriors.
The current Phobos is a young boy named Alexander Aaron. In the 2006 Ares: God or War mini-series, Alexander is taken from his father, Ares, by Zeus, and then kidnapped by the Japanese god Amatsu-Mikaboshi. Mikaboshi, in an attempt to destroy the Marvel pantheons, trains and manipulates Alex for at least five Olympian years–which vary substantially from human years in that years can pass to the gods while simultaneously only a few days or months passing for humans – under the guise of a mother-figure who eventually turns him into a deadly swordsman. He is saved from the evil deity when the combination of Zeus and Ares's influences broke his brainwashing. Their salvation apparently eliminates his skills.
Brian Michael Bendis then retconned these events in Mighty Avengers. When Alex / Phobos is first approached by fellow Secret Warrior Daisy, he is once again a young boy, untrained, and aware that his father is the god Ares (Mighty Avengers #13). (The general story of Mikaboshi destroying the Marvel pantheons and Zeus' sacrifice remains canon however). It is at this point that Daisy reveals to Alex that he is Phobos. Afterwards he begins to gain fear like powers, having inherited the original's abilities. However, in Mighty Avengers #13 he scared off a couple of boys, and after that he lied to Daisy that he doesn't have any powers, but she doesn't believe him. After talking with her he says 'that explains so much' because he realises then that he's new Phobos, and was born mortal, but after drinking Mikaboshi's blood he became god and now he has fear powers and Daisy told him who he really is (new god of fear). In that issue Ares tells him that he's an Avenger right now and he cannot worry about his grades.
During the Secret Invasion storyline, Alex is recruited by Nick Fury for his team of Secret Warriors. Post-invasion, he remains a member of the team and has shown evidence of additional pre-cognitive powers. However, his father has noticed his absence upon receiving a truancy notice. In the aftermath of Utopia, Ares followed Alex and Daisy to one of Fury's base, where he discovers his son's affiliation with the former S.H.I.E.L.D. director. Fury tells Ares that his son has potential. Ares ultimately accepts his son's decision, meaning that he doesn't need to hide his allegiance anymore. Phobos later pilots a Fury Life Model Decoy (LMD) to assist Black Widow and Songbird but they are captured by the Thunderbolts. As soon as Norman Osborn shoots the LMD in the head, Phobos reveals himself, inflicting Osborn with the fear that he will lose his mind soon enough. During Siege, Phobos tried to tag along with the other secret warriors to help the Asgardians, but Nick Fury would not let him, because he knew his father would die and he didn't want him to witness it. When the fiasco was over, Thor confronted Phobos telling him that Ares was dead and he offered to take him to see his next of kin in Mount Olympus. However, he declined his offer. Thor offered that if he ever changed his mind, he would take him there. Although he had mixed feelings with his dad, he still felt sad that he died.
Phobos is now in Elysium after having been stabbed and killed by Gorgon wielding the sword Godkiller. His last appearance had his father proud of his actions as they were reunited in the afterlife.


=== Powers and abilities of Phobos ===
Both versions of Phobos control the power of fear, a power that has been seen to cause victims to run for their lives as well as attack their partners. Certain characters have proven immune to this ability (i.e. Nick Fury and Gorgon); they cite that they lack fear as the reason. The current version of Phobos (Alex) was at one time a highly trained swordsman and possessed strength and endurance similar to other Olympian gods in the Marvel universe, however this has since been ret-conned. Secret Warriors #10 re-establishes his training with a sword. He was denied use of it by his father Ares, who required him to be proficient in all forms of arms before returning his sword. Currently he, like the previous Phobos, can instill fear in others. Additionally, he has shown evidence of pre-cognitive powers. When utilizing his fear based powers, Alex's eyes glow. The color has shown to vary between white and red. Whether this is simply due to the artist's rendering or the level of power usage is unknown.


=== Relationship between the two Phobos ===
According to the Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica, the original Phobos and the current Alex are two separate characters. More specifically, they are half-brothers. The Phobos profile indicates that the original Phobos (and his brother Deimos) were killed during Mikaboshi's invasion of Olympus, and that Alexander inherited the fear-based powers of his slain older half-brother following his return to Earth.


=== Reception of Phobos ===
In 2019, CBR.com ranked Phobos 9th in their "Marvel Comics: The 10 Most Powerful Olympians" list.
In 2022, Sportskeeda ranked Phobos 9th in their "10 best Greek gods from Marvel comics" list.

Piecemeal is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.


=== Gilbert Benson ===
Young Gilbert Benson was a mutant with the ability to absorb different energy frequencies and store them within his body. His mother, the armored mutant mercenary known as Harness, forced Gilbert to travel across the world with her to absorb the dispersed energy of Proteus.
Absorbing the energy, Piecemeal grew into a monstrous amalgamation of Gilbert and Proteus and set about warping reality across Scotland. Eventually the X-Factor team convinced the amalgamation that it could never be happy, and it opted to end its own existence.


=== Cyborg ===
Piecemeal was a cyborg created in a secret Amazon laboratory by a scientific team supervised by the Red Skull. Piecemeal was assembled from a combination of human and animal corpses and high-tech weaponry for the purpose of being the ultimate killing machine. Before the Red Skull could fully program Piecemeal's mind, the Hulk attacked the laboratory, but Piecemeal escaped in the confusion. The mindless Piecemeal wandered through the Amazon before stowing away on a cargo plane en route to Scotland. A retired Pantheon member residing on Loch Ness later summoned the Hulk when Piecemeal began attacking tourists and draining their minds. Piecemeal battled the Hulk–during which he revealed his ability to duplicate the Hulk's appearance and powers–and was apparently killed.

Pogg later fought against the Krakoan mutants in the battle after the tournament. Following Amenth's defeat, Pogg traveled to Earth. He briefly battled the X-Men during an attempted robbery on Gameworld, though he was pacified by a gift of mysterium in exchange for never fighting the X-Men again and owing a favor to Forge.
Though he appears to be a large multi-armed, crocodile-like beast, this is actually an organic suit. Pogg Ur-Pogg's true body is that of a small, weak, goblin-like creature. In combat, he wields a khopesh-like sword.

== Portal ==

=== Publication history ===

The character first appeared as Charles Little Sky in Avengers #304 (June 1989) and as Portal in Darkhawk #5 (July 1991).


=== Fictional character biography ===
Native American Charles Little Sky was born in Hartsdale, New Mexico. As a teenager, he manifested his dimension-spanning powers during a confrontation between the Avengers and Puma, the superhuman protector of Little Sky's tribe. Little Sky fled the reservation he lived on, moving to New York City where he took a job as a construction worker. He was followed by Puma, who had set out in pursuit of Little Sky out of fear that the powers he'd soon manifest would prove dangerous. When Puma finally tracked him down at Ellis Island, Little Sky's powers activated for the first time, opening a portal to the dimension where the U-Foes had been exiled, freeing them. The U-Foes attempted to kill Little Sky to keep him from using his powers to banish them again, and the Avengers and Puma were forced to team up to protect him. During the fight, Little Sky escaped, using his powers and began traveling the dimensions.
Along the way he picked up a variety of weapons, including a gun that fired 'energy harpoons,' and learned to control his powers. In one dimension he encountered Kistur, the leader of an intergalactic gang of criminals who was armed with one of the android Darkhawk bodies created by Dargin Bokk.  Kistur asked Little Sky to join the gang so they could use his powers to plunder other dimensions. Little Sky refused and Kistur tried to kill him, but Little Sky fought back and ended up accidentally shooting Kistur's Darkhawk amulet, the focal point of his powers, out of his chest. The loss of the amulet killed Kistur's Darkhawk body, and Little Sky removed and donned Kistur's body armor for further protection.  Worried that Kistur might revive, Little Sky attempted to destroy the amulet, but when that failed, he discarded it in another dimension. Little Sky eventually managed to return to Earth, opening a portal to a museum in New York City that Chris Powell and his family were touring. Powell transformed into his Darkhawk persona, and Portal, mistaking Powell for a reborn Kistur, attacked. Darkhawk managed to incapacitate Portal, who was taken in federal custody by a Guardsman. Portal had been injured during the fight and was placed in a hospital under the guard of Captain America. The U-Foes wanted Portal to take them to a dimension they'd once happened upon while they were exiled from Earth, and they attacked the hospital. Captain America, Darkhawk and Daredevil defeated the U-Foes, but Portal revived and after explaining how he had acquired parts of his armor from an opponent resembling Darkhawk, escaped to another dimension during the fight.
Portal surfaced again to retrieve his weapons and equipment from a federal research center, battling some Guardsmen. Portal was targeted by the Brotherhood of Mutants led by Toad, whose member Sauron brainwashed Portal into assisting them. He was rescued by Darkhawk, Spider-Man, and Sleepwalker, after which he escaped again into another dimensional warp. Portal would later return as Darkhawk's ally, protecting New York in his stead at a time when Darkhawk seemed to be dying and needed time to recuperate. During that time, Portal was targeted by Shaper, a superhuman snuff artist who'd targeted Darkhawk for death. Shaper ended up going after Portal instead when Portal began using Chris Powell's amulet to become the Darkhawk in Chris's place. Meanwhile, members of the Mahari race, another alien species from the same home world as Kistur, took control of the Darkhawk ship in a plan to avenge Kistur. They reanimated Kistur in a redesigned Darkhawk android as Overhawk, and went after Portal's family. In the end, Portal and Darkhawk managed to prevent them from destroying the Earth.
Charles is one of the few mutants who retained their superhuman powers after the M-Day. He is shown as the director of A.R.M.O.R. and he used his powers to transport Machine Man and Jocasta to the Marvel Zombies universe. He collects Jocasta after Machine Man retrieves a sample of the still-living Vanessa Fisk's tissues, but is forced to leave a badly damaged Machine Man behind. After fending off the Zombies that invaded A.R.M.O.R., with the help of Jocasta, Machine Man and the 616-Earth Morbius, Portal discovered that some of them managed to escape. He then approved Morbius' project to reform the Midnight Sons to destroy the living dead.


=== Powers, abilities, and equipment ===
Portal is a mutant capable of opening rifts in space passing through extra-dimensional warps to transport himself and others. His portals allow instantaneous travel between different vibratory-attuned planes of reality, or "dimensions". Opening a portal without preparation will give him access to another dimension completely at random. Portal is capable of using his powers for teleportation, traveling instantly across about a few miles within a single dimension. Trying to transport himself more than a few miles in one jump, however, will destabilize the portal and send him off into another dimension, even if he is trying to stay anchored in one. Dimensional warps created by Portal cease to exist when he is rendered unconscious.
Portal has also been shown to be able to home in on other people who have gone through one of his portals, opening a new gateway to retrieve or follow them if necessary. He used that ability to rescue Spider-Man from the dimension he had thrown the wall-crawler into while under Sauron's control. Portal is also armed with a wide variety of weaponry, including a huge gun that shoots 'energy harpoons' (fires concussive force blasts capable of leveling an office building), a hand-weapon (capable of firing a fast-hardening adhesive substance which impedes physical movement of target), a wheel (a 1⁄2-inch-thick (13 mm) throwing disc which can separate into components with independent guidance systems, each of which contains a burst of concussive force equal to several hand grenades). He also has a suit of body armor composed of alien materials that he stole from a dead Darkhawk android that has been outfitted to allow him to survive in space. Portal carries a supply of adhesive ammunition contained in his belt, and a directional mechanism that focuses his warp power. Little Sky also has a quantity of gymnastics training. He is highly skilled in the use of his own weaponry, and a skilled motorcyclist.

== Post ==
Kevin Tremain was a mutant captured and studied by the Mandarin. His first appearance was in X-Men (vol. 2) #50. On a secret mission, the Six Pack attacked the secret base Tremain was held in. Tremain was mortally injured; Cable tried to save his life, first by using his telekinesis to keep Tremain's body together, and finally by giving him a blood transfusion. Although it seems he survived this trauma, Cable seemed to think Tremain had later died.
Years later, Tremain resurfaced as Post, the lowest of Onslaught's emissaries. Post had superhuman size, strength, stamina, and sturdiness. He was also a mathematical genius. After being infected with the T-O virus via blood transfusion from Cable, Post became a cyborg, who was also able to generate energy discharges, cloaking fields, biogenetic scanners and teleport himself to remote locations.

Malcolm Powder first appeared in Alias #6 (April 2002), created by Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos. Powder was a high school student and a fan of Jessica Jones.
He made his first appearance by breaking into Jessica's apartment and answering her phone. Jessica kicked him out. Later, while Jessica was looking for a Rick Jones (not the famous one), Powder showed up again asking for a job as her personal part-time secretary. He was kicked out once again.
Powder arrived again, this time asking Jessica about the secret identities of Captain America and Daredevil. He asked for a job, and Jessica agreed under the condition that he find information on Mattie Franklin, who was missing. To Jessica's surprise, Powder showed up with a girl named Laney, who claimed her brother was dating Mattie around the time she disappeared. He was last seen answering Jessica's phone as her secretary.

Powderkeg is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.


=== Publication history ===
Powderkeg first appeared in Captain Marvel Special #1 and was created by Dwayne McDuffie and Mark D. Bright.


=== Fictional character biography ===
Little is known about the man who became Powderkeg. He was a mercenary hired to steal high-tech circuitry for Brazilian crime lord Kristina Ramos. He ran afoul of Captain Marvel II (Monica Rambeau) who had thought she lost her powers after stopping a mutated Marrina. She encounters Powderkeg and used her new powers to defeat him. Powderkeg fights the Avengers during a failed mass prison escape occurring at the Vault ("Venom Deathrap: The Vault"). During the incident, he follows the leader of the breakout, Venom. Teamed with Mentallo and Vermin, they temporarily defeat Iron Man and Hank Pym. The entire breakout is soon neutralized by technological means, with energy pumped through Mentallo.
Powderkeg is later recruited by Doctor Octopus to join his incarnation of the Masters of Evil during the Infinity War. The Masters of Evil confront the Guardians of the Galaxy in the Avengers Mansion. Everyone becomes embroiled in a fight against evil doubles of both teams. Magus, the villain behind the Infinity War, had recruited an army of super-powered doubles to defeat and absorb Earth's superpowered resistance. Both groups work together to survive the assault. Doctor Octopus wants to continue his assault on the Mansion and on the Guardians. Powderkeg and his other allies disagree, unwilling to turn on those who they had fought besides minutes earlier. The Masters turn on Octopus, pursuing him out of the Mansion.
At some point, Powderkeg is captured and imprisoned, where he would later team up with a number of other villains against the She-Hulk, although they are defeated. He has appeared in Brand New Day as one of the patrons of the Bar With No Name. At some point in time between then and the fall of Norman Osborn, he was captured and sent to the Raft, where, during a visit by the Avengers Academy, there was a power failure caused by team member Hazmat. The power failure enables the prisoners to riot. Powderkeg almost crushes Hazmat and Mettle, but the timely intervention of Tigra saved them. He is put back in his cell in the end.

== Presence ==
Presence is the name of a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
As a younger man, Sergei Krylov was a Belarusian nuclear physicist born in Minsk, BSSR. His twin children, Nikolai Krylenko and Laynia Petrovna, were taken from birth by the Soviet government to be trained as soldiers, after their mutant natures manifested.
Sergei eventually became one of the most influential men behind the scenes of the Soviet government. However, despite being a scientific genius, he was also quite mad. He caused a Chernobyl-like nuclear disaster in the "Forbidden Zone" using cobalt radiation baths and a nuclear blast, which transformed Tania Belinsky into his super-powered thrall as the second Red Guardian. The nuclear energy transformed Sergei into a superhuman being as well, and he could now generate nuclear energy within his own body for various uses. Sergi began calling himself "The Presence". The Presence and Red Guardian battled the Defenders when they came to find her. The Presence left when she regained her free will and spurned him. Soon after, the Presence battled a giant mutated amoeba in the "Forbidden Zone", and was then reunited and reconciled with Red Guardian.
The government now wanted the threat of the Presence eliminated. His own children had been trained by the government as super-powered soldiers and, unaware of their true relationship, were sent to kill him. Alongside the Red Guardian, Presence encountered the Hulk, Professor Phobos, and the Soviet Super-Soldiers in the "Forbidden Zone". Darkstar and Vanguard learned that the Presence was their father and turned against the Soviet regime, and saved the Presence from Phobos. To save the Soviet Union from the radiation of the Forbidden Zone, an irradiated Soviet wasteland, the Presence and the Red Guardian absorbed the radiation into themselves and left for outer space, where they claimed they would transform themselves into inert matter. The twins became agents on their own, fighting for the good of the people, and sometimes working with their father.
The Presence was revealed to be held prisoner with Red Guardian (now calling herself Starlight) on the Stranger's laboratory world. The pair returned to Earth with the Jack of Hearts. The Presence attempted to kill Eon, but was instead trapped in the "Quantum Zone" dimension by Quasar. It was revealed in flashback how Maelstrom had persuaded the Presence to attack Eon. The Presence was eventually rescued from the "Quantum Zone" by Neutron, and teamed with him to seek vengeance on Quasar. The Presence learned of the Soviet Union's collapse, and returned to Russia with the intent to create a "new order". Later, the Presence sent Starlight to capture the Black Widow and Darkstar.
Vanguard was ultimately killed in a battle while he and Darkstar were aiding Quasar. Darkstar blamed Quasar for her brother's death and fled back to Russia. When she encountered her father, Darkstar shared her feelings with him, and the Presence forced Quasar to flee Earth on the threat of killing Quasar's loved ones. Sergei visited his son's memorial and sought to revive him by shifting his atoms to microscopically enter Vanguard's body.  There he discovered a trace of Vanguard's mutant energy remained, keeping him faintly alive. The Presence managed to use this energy to resurrect his son, but nearly exhausted his own power, and was cast adrift in the subatomic reality he had entered.
While in subatomic exile, the Presence discovered new aspects of his power and atomic particles, and when he had sufficiently regenerated, resumed his normal size and returned to the Forbidden Zone. There he embarked on a plan to unite all of the former Soviet Union by transforming its people into a race of zombie-like radioactive beings living under a communal mind. He managed to convert several Siberian scientists, Vanguard and the rest of the Winter Guard, and the Avengers, who investigated the disturbance, leaving only Thor and the seemingly-immortal Firebird to stand against him. As Thor threatened to kill the Presence, Starlight, as the Presence's companion, ultimately offered their surrender and used her own power to revive those who had been transformed and remand herself and the Presence to Russian custody; she did not share his vision, but their powers meant that they would only ever have each other for company, and so she wished to keep him alive. In the final struggle of the Kang War, the Presence and Starlight aided in the struggle to destroy Kang the Conqueror's Damocles Base space station, with Starlight blackmailing the Presence for assistance by threatening to leave him if he attempted anything more than simply doing his job and subsequently returning to his cell.
In the 2010 Darkstar and Winter Guard limited series, The Presence was apparently destroyed permanently when the Russian superhero Powersurge sacrificed his life to defeat him after he once again tried to conquer Russia after Starlight left him for good to join the People's Protectorate, where she fell in love with his son, Vanguard.
In Deadpool and the Mercs for Money, the Presence is briefly revived by Umbral Dynamics (a corporation secretly led by Caroline Le Fay) by harvesting the power of several superhumans with radiation-related powers. After a fight with the new Mercs for Money and Deadpool, the Presence is killed again by Negasonic Teenage Warhead who drains his power.

== Lee Price ==

Lee Price is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was created by Mike Costa and Gerardo Sandoval, and first appears in Venom (Vol. 3) #1. Lee Price was an Army Ranger discharged after losing two of his fingers in an explosion. Unable to find gainful employment due to his disability, Lee was hired as an enforcer for Black Cat's criminal organization. Lee was almost killed in an arms-deal gone wrong, but was saved by the Venom symbiote, who he dominated using his military training. Lee intended to keep the symbiote a secret and use it to rise through the ranks of Black Cat's gang, but his identity was discovered by a pair of corrupt FBI agents who attempted to blackmail him into becoming a mole. Lee was double-crossed by fellow enforcer Mac Gargan, who was suspicious of him and bore a grudge against the symbiote from his time as its host. Confronted by Spider-Man, Price attempted to escape with the symbiote. However, Spider-Man and the symbiote's former host Eddie Brock, now an agent for the FBI's Anti-Symbiote Task Force, managed to help it break free of Lee's control and it abandoned him to be arrested.
Lee's lawyer was able to get him exonerated by arguing that the crimes he'd committed had been due to the symbiote's influence, and Lee promptly attacked Andi Benton and stole her symbiote, taking the alias Maniac and using it to establish his own crime syndicate--the Inklings. Spider-Man, Venom, Andi, Black Cat, and Flash Thompson--now bonded to the Anti-Venom symbiote--set aside their differences to stop Lee from seizing control of all of New York's crime families, though he remained bonded to the weakened Mania symbiote. Imprisoned again, Lee was killed by Cletus Kasady disguised as Eddie Brock in order to extract his symbiote. 
During the Blood Hunt event, the vampiric alien Threkker reanimated Lee's corpse--as well as the remnants of the Mania symbiote still present in his body--to serve as bait for symbiotes. The Venom symbiote rebonded to the zombified Lee to defeat Threkker, but was separated from him by Meridius--an evil future version of Eddie Brock. Meridius used the reanimated remnants of the Mania symbiote to create the K-Chemical version #44, which he attempted to use to conquer the Earth. Although Meridius was destroyed and the "Zombiote" plague stopped, Lee remained locked in a vault in one of Alchemax's laboratories.

== Prodigy ==

Prodigy is the name of several characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.


=== Ritchie Gilmore ===

Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Prodigy first appeared in Slingers #0  (Sept. 1998), and was created by Joseph Harris and Adam Pollina. Prodigy was one of the feature characters in the 2011 six-issue limited series Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt. Prodigy eventually joined the Avengers Initiative.
Ritchie Gilmore is a typical jock, captain of his college wrestling team, and one of the most popular guys in school. But Ritchie wants more from life; he wants to be stronger and more powerful. The Black Marvel gives him the Prodigy costume, and the chance to be something better. The costume had been imbued with power: it gives Ritchie superhuman strength, he can leap so far and high that it appears that he is flying, and his cape even allows him to glide. Black Marvel makes Ritchie the leader of his new team, the Slingers. However, he is cold and unfeeling towards his teammates, not even showing concern when Dusk falls to her death, and is not shocked when she comes back to life. Prodigy feels that he should not have to help his team, and that they need to learn how to handle things on their own. Once, he leaves the Slingers in a collapsing tunnel, saying that if they are truly heroes, they would be able to survive. He is just as prone to beat his friends as his enemies. When he feels that Ricochet challenges his authority, he attacks him, and is only prevented from seriously injuring him by Hornet's intervention. Hornet also has to blast Prodigy with his laser "stingers" to keep him from killing a gang member. Prodigy learns that Black Marvel had made a deal with a demon called Mephisto to give him his costume, and that the demon had collected his "mentor's" soul as payment. While the other three members of his team go to save Black Marvel, he abandons them. But when Ricochet is confronted with an illusion of his dead mother, Prodigy comes back to snap him out of his trance. Prodigy admits that his heart was filled with hate, and he lets that hatred go, and helps his friends free Black Marvel's soul. The team disbands, but Prodigy apologizes for his actions before he leaves, and says he needs to check on his grandmother, as she had been missing quite a while.
Prodigy returns very drunk standing on a rooftop and openly defies the Superhuman Registration Act during the Civil War storyline. Iron Man soon arrives on the scene along with agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Prodigy declares Iron Man a traitor and then attacks him. Prodigy is defeated by Iron Man and apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Prodigy succeeds, however, in sending a message to the people of the Marvel Universe. It is considered the first act of Civil War. Prodigy is later shown, where he is one of the inmates imprisoned in the Negative Zone; where he was seen by Peter Parker (during his tour with Iron Man) in regards to the status of those that refused to register.  Prodigy is one of the heroes that is freed from his cell when Hulkling, under the guise of Hank Pym, opens the cells.  He joins Captain America's side to fight Iron Man.
Prodigy next appears as one of The Initiative's new recruits. One of the stipulations of his release from jail is that he takes responsibility for his drunken actions against Iron Man, then appear to fully support the Initiative. Hank Pym talks to him about his drinking 'problem' which Gilmore denied, yet one of the first things he does is go out and buy beer for the group, although he doesn't allow the under-age Batwing to drink. During the Secret Invasion storyline, Prodigy is one of the many heroes who fight rampaging powered Skrulls in Times Square. After the invasion, Prodigy is placed on a probationary period, rather than being assigned to an Initiative team.
After agreeing to work for Norman Osborn as seen in the Dark Reign storyline, Prodigy is placed on the Heavy Hitters. However, eventually he becomes disillusioned with the reorganization of the Initiative under Osborn, who had placed criminals on Initiative teams and publicly seceded his team from the Initiative. Part of this was team member 'Outback' who was in reality the violent thief 'Boomerang'. Prodigy waits for Osborn's reprisal out in the open, intending for the fight to be caught on camera. Force of Nature attack him, and are soon joined by the U-Foes, Freedom Force, members of the Shadow Initiative, and some members of the Hood's army. Justice offers to help, but Prodigy wants to do this alone. Then he is ganged up on by the Initiative members while his teammates Telemetry and Nonstop upload footage of the combat to YouTube. Prodigy was held at Prison 42. Osborn insisted he be treated well so the public will eventually forget about him. After Osborn is removed from power following the Siege of Asgard, Prodigy is released and honored for his resistance against Osborn. He has joined the motivational speaker circuit, but he's also trying to reunite the longtime fractured roster of Slingers.
During the Fear Itself storyline, he takes an office job. Then, Steve Rogers has him assemble a new incarnation of the Avengers Initiative, to deal with the fear and chaos that was happening. At the end of the story-arc, he gets a promotion, only to find out his "promotion" is storage arrangement.


==== Powers and abilities ====
Prodigy's costume is mystically infused with power, giving him vast superhuman strength, speed, and stamina. He can leap incredible distances and when he jumps, it appears that he is flying. His golden costume is completely bulletproof, and can withstand most physical assaults. His cape functions as a hang glider, and enables him to glide on air currents.
Prodigy is also adept in the skills of collegiate wrestling. He himself is the captain of the wrestling team at Empire State University. He often employs these grappling techniques when he fights. Prodigy has used submission moves as well, which may stem from the trend of collegiate wrestlers competing in MMA.

He had a hand in the origin of Wolverine as part of the Weapon X Project. Thorton first appeared in Marvel Comics Presents #73 and was created by Barry Windsor-Smith. Windsor-Smith intended the Professor to be the head of the Weapon X project, but after he had written and drawn several installments of the "Weapon X" serial in which the Professor first appears, Chris Claremont told him that he had always wanted Apocalypse to be the one responsible for Wolverine's adamantium, so he added scenes where the Professor reports to an unseen superior to the later installments.
Because he is referred to only as "The Professor" in the "Weapon X" serial and has obvious physical similarities to Professor X (a narrow skull, baldness, etc.), there was considerable speculation that the character was a young Professor X. Though no in-universe connection between the two was ever established, in an interview shortly before "Weapon X" was published, Windsor-Smith hinted that the similarity was intentional: "... one [character] is called the Professor, who, by sheer coincidence, looks just like Professor X." [emphases in original]
In 1972, Thorton experimented on numerous mutants including Sabretooth and Mastodon. He hired Carol Hines as his assistant and the scientist Abraham Cornelius. His experiments on Wolverine are responsible for his adamantium-laced skeleton. He is also connected to the creation of Alpha Flight on to developing super-soldiers for the US government. During the adamantium-lacing process, the physical trauma causes Wolverine to regress to violent animal behavior, prone to attacking anyone who comes near. In a virtual reality simulation, Thorton's mysterious "master" takes control of Wolverine and has him attack everyone in the facility, cutting off Thorton's right hand and killing him. Afterwards Wolverine escapes for real and confronts Thorton. Though the outcome of this encounter is not shown, when Thorton next appears, in Wolverine vol. 2 #49 and 50, he has a metal hook in place of his right hand.
Years later, Thorton and Carol Hines lure Wolverine into an abandoned warehouse in Canada which was once the secret location for the Weapon X program. Codenamed Project X, Wolverine discovers Weapon X was funded by the CIA and sheltered in Canada. Thorton activates a robotic android named Shiva, which is programmed to destroy all of Project X's test subjects, starting with Wolverine. Another Project X test subject, Silver Fox, steps forward to interrogate Thorton at gunpoint. He tries to grab the gun from Silver Fox and she shoots him fatally. Romulus was in control of Weapon X and gave orders to Truett. Although it is said that Romulus had known Logan in a past life, it is unclear if he knew of Logan while he was young and living at the Howlett estate if this he did then he would have known of Truett's connection to Logan.

== Protégé ==

Protégé is a cosmic entity from an alternate future of the Marvel Universe.
The character, created by Jim Valentino, first appeared in Guardians of the Galaxy #15 (August 1991) as the childlike ruler of the Universal Church of Truth of the alternate future of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Valentino modeled him after his son Aaron at seven years old. He is depicted as a superhuman of unlimited potential, with the ability to duplicate not only super-powers, but also the skills of others simply by observing the ability being used.
Later, Protégé uses its abilities to duplicate the powers of the Living Tribunal, nearly usurping its place in Marvel's cosmology. When attempts to defeat Protégé fail, The Living Tribunal states that any and all realities rest on Protégé's shoulders. Protégé itself claims to have become the new One-Above-All. Scathan the Approver, a Celestial, saves all realities by judging against Protégé. The Living Tribunal then absorbs Protégé into itself to prevent him from endangering all realities again.

== Pulsar ==

Pulsar, originally code-named Impulse, is a member of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard. Created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum, the character first appeared in X-Men #107 (October 1977). An energy being in a containment suit, Pulsar is capable of flight and the projection of energy blasts. Like many original members of the Imperial Guard, Pulsar is the analog of a character from DC Comics' Legion of Super-Heroes: in his case Wildfire.
Impulse was amongst the first of the Imperial Guard encountered by the team of superhuman mutants known as the X-Men who sought to rescue Shi'ar empress Lilandra Neramani from her brother D'Ken. Following their emperor's orders, the Guard clashed with the X-Men on a nameless Shi'ar Empire planet and were on the verge of winning when the band of interstellar freebooters known as the Starjammers arrived to turn the tide of battle in the X-Men's favor. After the battle, Lilandra takes over as Majestrix, and the Guard swears allegiance to her.
The character is seemingly killed by Vulcan in the Emperor Vulcan storyline. Vulcan, a powerful mutant intent on conquering the Shi'ar Empire, fights the Guard, killing Cosmo and Smasher (and seemingly Impulse, Neutron, and Titan) before he is defeated by Gladiator, who puts out his left eye. It is later revealed that Impulse either survived Vulcan's attack or was replaced by someone from the Subguardian ranks, because he reappears in the War of Kings storyline. Beginning with the "Infinity" crossover, the character's name is changed to Pulsar.
Pulsar has many further adventures with the Imperial Guard, including being involved in the trial of Jean Grey and the return of Thanos.


== Pulse ==

Pulse (Augustus) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Pulse is a mutant who retained his powers post-M-Day. Pulse first appeared in X-Men vol. 2, #173 (September, 2005).
Sometime after having Gambit was not right for her. Mystique's plan to rid Rogue of Gambit involved sowing discord in the couple's romance and, once the pair was soon to be no more, introduce Rogue to Augustus. Given the dialogue between Mystique and him, in which Mystique says that she "wanted to see for [herself] that [Augustus] is the man she hopes he is," it can be assumed that the associates did not yet know each other well.
Augustus and Mystique were next seen, stealing paintings from a house. Mystique asks what he does with all of the money he gets from selling stolen goods on the black market, he replies that he invests the money into stocks he knows will soon crash, as he gets some kind of sick pleasure out of losing other peoples' money. Mystique replies, "Time you were safely married, Augustus."  Augustus is worried about Gambit's reaction, and comically remarks upon the authenticity of how Cajun he really is.  Mystique then reveals she is certain that of all the men she checked out to be Rogue's new romance, Augustus is the one who can "make my daughter happy."
Mystique and Augustus make their way back to the Xavier Institute and Mystique announces she is joining the X-Men after what happened last time—before making it very clear that she is going to set Augustus up with Rogue. In a moment alone, Augustus and Rogue sit down in a tree to talk to one another. At first, Rogue is defensive and declares that no matter what her "crazy mother" told Augustus, she and Gambit are happy together. She explains that they, of course, have their problems, and Augustus replies that he doesn't have problems. Continuing on, Augustus says that Mystique wants Rogue to be happy. Rogue replies that she isn't, and explains her power to him. He tells her not to worry about it and his eyes begin to glow. Rogue looks down at his hand and notices that nothing has happened to him; she asks how long his hand has been there without anything happening. He replies, "Don't worry about that, either."
Outside of Apocalypse's temple, Mystique suggests that they use Pulse to neutralize Apocalypse; the X-Men argue over the idea. Rogue interrupts, stating that they should ask Augustus if he can do this to Apocalypse. He smiles coyly and replies that he "doesn't know." Later in the issue, Gambit is revealed to be the new Horseman of Death. In his time as a Horseman, Gambit twice attempted to kill Rogue so as to break his ties to his former life. Both times, Pulse was able to save Rogue by neutralizing Gambit's powers and physically overcoming him. Afterwards, Pulse attempted to woo Rogue; at first, Rogue seemed somewhat accepting of the idea, but once Pulse made a comment about Gambit, Rogue rejected him, stating that she "never [wants] to worry about romance again." As Rogue left, Mystique commented on his poor timing. Pulse told her to go away, and his current status is unclear. Since Decimation he was one of the few mutants to retain his powers and was forcibly relocated to the mutant camp for the 198.
Augustus produces a disruptive pulse from his eyes which can disable systems and people, including mutant and non-mutant powers, and scramble electronic systems. His power also creates a masking effect that shields his mind from psychics.

== Purge ==

Purge is a fictional mutant in the Marvel Comics Universe. He was created by Chris Claremont and Aaron Lopresti, and his first appearance was in Excalibur vol. 3 #3.
Little is known about Purge before he made his appearance on the desolate island of Genosha. He was one of the few survivors after Cassandra Nova programmed her Wild Sentinels to decimate the island, killing over 16 million mutants.
Somehow he found other survivors and allied himself with Unus the Untouchable and his gang. Inside of the gang, he mostly worked with Hub and Hack and the three of them began to doubt if Unus' exclusive, clique-like strategy was the best way.
When a mentally ill Scarlet Witch removed the mutant gene from over 90% of the mutant population during the "Decimation" storyline, Purge was one of the many who lost his powers. However, Quicksilver — as an act of penance for his part in the worldwide depowering during the "Son of M" miniseries — stole some Terrigen crystals from the Inhumans in an attempt to repower some mutants. He started his mass efforts in Genosha and effectively restored the abilities of many on the island including Hub, Hack, Unus, Wicked, Freakshow, and Callisto. During a confrontation with the Inhumans, the group's abilities were amplified beyond control and quickly faded after they were taken to the hospital.
Before M-Day, Purge had the powers of superhuman strength, agility, and resilience.
