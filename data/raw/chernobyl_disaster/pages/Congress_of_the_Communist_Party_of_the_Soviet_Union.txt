The Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Russian: Съезд Коммунистической партии Советского Союза, romanized: S"ezd Kommunisticheskoy partii Sovetskovo Soyuza) was the supreme decision-making body of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Its meetings served as convention of all party delegates and their predecessors.
Between the congresses the party was ruled by the Central Committee. Over the course of the party's history, the name was changed in accordance with the current name of the party at the time. The frequency of party congresses varied with the meetings being annual events in the 1920s while no congress was held at all between 1939 and 1952.  After the death of Joseph Stalin, the congresses were held every five years.
