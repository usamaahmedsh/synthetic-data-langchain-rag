== History ==
The ministry was established on 29 August 2019 when Mykhailo Fedorov was appointed as Minister of Digital Transformation in the Honcharuk Government.
In September 2019, it was stated that the ministry's most important project was the so-called "state in a smartphone" project that was aiming that 100% of all government services should be available online with 20% of services provided automatically, without the intervention of an official, and 1 online fill-in form to receive a package of services "in any life situation" by 2024. On 5 November 2019, Minister of Digital Transformation Fedorov wrote on Facebook that the "state in a smartphone" project would not be founded by the state budget in 2020 (but he hoped it would be in 2021) but that it would rely "on an effective team and international technical assistance, public-private partnerships, volunteering." The following day Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk stressed that each government ministry had planned expenditures for digitization and that the Ministry of Digital Transformation did have a separate budget and thus the state budget was sufficient to launch the "state in a smartphone" project in 2020. On 21 March 2023, Fedorov continued his ministerial post, but with an extended portfolio: Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Education, Science and Technology - Minister for Digital Transformation.
