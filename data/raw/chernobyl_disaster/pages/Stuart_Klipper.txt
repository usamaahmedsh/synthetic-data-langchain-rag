Stuart Klipper (born 1941 in Bronx, New York City) is an American photographer.


== Biography ==
He lived in Stockholm, Sweden, but then moved to his current residence in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1970.
He lived in Brooklyn Heights as well as the near to it Cobble Hill neighborhood (also in Brooklyn, New York) soon after graduating from the University of Michigan in 1962, and before he moved to Minneapolis in 1970.
Klipper has made six journeys to Antarctica to take photographs. He has also worked in Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, Alaska, and the area of Lapland irradiated by the Chernobyl disaster. Klipper became one of approximately 400 people to have stood at both the South Pole and the North Pole on July 15, 2009, when he visited the North Pole.
Other major forays have taken Klipper across the deserts of Israel and Sinai as well as the tropical rain forests of Costa Rica. Klipper's work has also taken him to Northern Australia, Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.
He has logged thousands of miles traveling at sea while photographing on all of the Earth's oceans and seas.
For over 30 years, Klipper traveled through the 50 United States, capturing photographs that crystallize the defining characteristics of American regions. He also photographed major physics and astronomy research installations throughout the United States and the Anasazi ruins of the Southwest.
Klipper has also photographed the cemeteries of World War I and memorials of the Western Front.
Klipper's photographs have been exhibited in and collected by major museums from both the United States and overseas. These include New York City's Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Art Institute of Chicago, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Walker Art Center, The Jewish Museum, The Israel Museum, The Victoria and Albert Museum, the Bonn Kunsthalle, and the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden.
The Guggenheim Foundation, The Bush Foundation, the McKnight Foundation, and the Minnesota State Arts Board have all awarded Klipper multiple grants.
