The Namie-Odaka Nuclear Power Plant (浪江・小高原子力発電所, Namie Odaka genshiryoku hatsudensho) was a planned nuclear power plant in Minamisōma and Namie in the Fukushima Prefecture, Japan.   It was a project of the Tōhoku Electric Power Company. Preliminary ground work had been completed by the time of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.  The plans were canceled after urging from local lawmakers in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and due to strong local opposition. On January 31, 2017, Tohoku Electric decided to donate the site of about 1.2 million square meters to Namie Town free of charge.
