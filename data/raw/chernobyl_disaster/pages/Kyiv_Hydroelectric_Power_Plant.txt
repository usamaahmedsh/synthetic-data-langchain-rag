Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant (Ukrainian: Київська ГЕС, romanized: Kyivska HES, lit. 'Kyiv Hydroelectric Station') is a run-of-river power plant on the Dnieper River in Vyshhorod, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine. The 288 m (945 ft) long dam creates the Kyiv Reservoir with the purpose of hydroelectric power generation and navigability with the dam's associated lock. The first of 20 generators in the power station was commissioned in 1964, and the last in 1968. Together with the Kyiv Pumped Storage Power Plant, it creates a hydroelectricity generating complex. It is operated by the Ukrhydroenergo. Turbines for the plant were produced by the Kharkiv Factory Turboatom, and generators by the Kharkiv Factory "Elektrovazhmash".

On 24 February 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Andrii Nikonchuk died defending the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant from Russian air raids. On 26 August 2024, an energy facility of the complex was damaged in a Russian attack. The attack hit one of the hydroelectric dams. Throughout the war, concerns have been raised over the effects of flooding caused by a possible dam collapse on the Kyiv area in case of an attack.
