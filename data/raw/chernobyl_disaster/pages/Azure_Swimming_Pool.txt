The Azure Swimming Pool (Ukrainian: Басейн Лазурний) is one of the indoor swimming pools in the abandoned city of Pripyat, Ukraine, which was affected by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.


== History ==
The complex was built in the 1970s and remained in use until 1998 (12 years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster); during those 12 years the swimming pool was mainly used by Chernobyl liquidators. The swimming pool was considered to be one of the cleanest places in Pripyat. However, the swimming pool and the adjacent indoor basketball court have been abandoned and left to decay since its closure in 1998.
