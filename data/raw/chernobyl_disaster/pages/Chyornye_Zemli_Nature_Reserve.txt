Chornye Zemli Nature Reserve (Russian: заповедник Чёрные земли) (also) is a Russian 'zapovednik' (strict nature reserve). The name in Russian means "Black Lands".  The main part of the reserve is located in the Caspian Depression, northwest of the Caspian Sea.  It was originally created in 1990 to protect the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica). In the meantime, the economy of Kalmykia collapsed and the numbers of saiga have crashed due to poaching for meat and horns (Chinese medicine) and desertification caused by overgrazing by domestic animals. The reserve also has colonies of egrets, cormorants, and rare pelicans.   The reserve is situated in the Chernozemelsky District of Republic of Kalmykia.  It was created in 1990, and covers 1,219 km2 in two locations, with a 900 km2 buffer zone.
Since 1993 to 2021, Cherny Zemli Nature Reserve was designated as one of UNESCO biosphere reserves.
