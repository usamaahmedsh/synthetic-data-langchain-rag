UNESCO's Memory of the World International Register lists documentary heritage – texts, audio-visual materials, library and archive holdings – that have been judged to be of global importance. The register brings that heritage to the attention of experts and the wider public, promoting the preservation, digitization, and dissemination of those materials.
The first inscriptions were added to the register in 1997. As of 2023, 496 pieces of documentary heritage had been included in the register. Of these, 274 are from the Europe and North America region. These include recordings of folk music; ancient languages and phonetics; aged remnants of religious and secular manuscripts; collective lifetime works of renowned giants of literature; science and music; copies of landmark motion pictures and short films; and archives documenting significant political, economic, and social changes.
