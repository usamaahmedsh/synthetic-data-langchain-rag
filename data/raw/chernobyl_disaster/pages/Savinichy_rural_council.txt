It was created in 1965 from 15 settlements of the Yanowka rural councl (renamed to Vysokae rural council) (Аляксандраўка, Будзішча, Гарадзешня I, Гарадзешня II, Горкі, Гразівец, Дзяражня, Замашэнне, Кашаноўка, Кіследзь, Rysin, Савінічы, Студзянец, Цітаўка, Шышкоўка).
In 1970 the Savinichy forestry was organized, to manage the forests of the territory.
After the Chernobyl disaster most of the population of the rural council was  resettled. In 1992 it was abolished and its territory was included into the Tsimanava rural council. The forestry administration, preserving  its name, moved to Tsimanava rural council.
