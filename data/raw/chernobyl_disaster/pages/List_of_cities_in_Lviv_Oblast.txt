There are 44 populated places in Lviv Oblast, Ukraine, that have been officially granted city status (Ukrainian: місто, romanized: misto) by the Verkhovna Rada, the country's parliament. Settlements with more than 10,000 people are eligible for city status, although the status is typically also granted to settlements of historical or regional importance. As of 5 December 2001, the date of the first and only official census in the country since independence, the most populous city in the oblast was the regional capital, Lviv, with a population of 732,818 people, while the least populous city was Uhniv, with 974 people. In 2024, following the passage of derussification laws, the city of Chervonohrad was renamed Sheptytskyi. The center of the city of Lviv and two wooden churches in Drohobych and Zhovkva are also among the eight World Heritage Sites in Ukraine recognized by UNESCO.
From independence in 1991 to 2020, nine cities in the oblast were designated as cities of regional significance (municipalities), which had self-government under city councils, while the oblast's remaining 35 cities were located in 20 raions (districts) as cities of district significance, which are subordinated to the governments of the raions. On 18 July 2020, an administrative reform abolished and merged the oblast's raions and cities of regional significance into seven new, expanded raions. The seven raions that make up the oblast are Drohobych, Lviv, Sambir, Sheptytskyi, Stryi, Yavoriv, and Zolochiv.
