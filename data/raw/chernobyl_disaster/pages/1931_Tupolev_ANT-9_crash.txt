The 1931 Tupolev ANT-9 crash was an aviation accident involving a Tupolev ANT-9 aircraft, which occurred in the Naro-Fominsky District of Moscow Oblast, Soviet Union, on Sunday, July 12, 1931.


== Accident ==
The aircraft was transporting a military commission headed by Deputy Chief of Staff of the RKKA, Vladimir Kirillovich Triandafillov, and was piloted by the experienced Stepan Timofeyevich Rybalchuk. Early in the morning, with fog present, Rybalchuk decided to proceed with the flight despite the poor weather conditions (reportedly due to vanity in some accounts). The flight was conducted at low altitude. In the vicinity of the Alabino platform, the plane struck trees, crashed to the ground, and was destroyed. All eight people on board—three passengers and five crew members—perished.
