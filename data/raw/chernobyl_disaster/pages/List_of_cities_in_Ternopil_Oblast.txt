There are 18 populated places in Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine, that have been officially granted city status (Ukrainian: місто, romanized: misto) by the Verkhovna Rada, the country's parliament. Settlements with more than 10,000 people are eligible for city status, although the status is typically also granted to settlements of historical or regional importance. Cities are the highest ranking category of populated places in Ukraine's settlement hierarchy.
Prior to 2020, four cities in the oblast were designated as cities of regional significance (municipalities), which had self-government under city councils, while the oblast's remaining 14 cities were located amongst the oblast's 17 raions (districts) as cities of district significance, which are subordinated to the governments of the raions. On 18 July 2020, an administrative reform abolished and merged the oblast's raions and cities of regional significance into three new, expanded raions. The three raions that now make up the oblast are Chortkiv, Kremenets, and Ternopil.
As of 5 December 2001, the date of the first and only official census in the country since independence, the most populous city in the oblast was the regional capital, Ternopil, with a population of 227,755 people, while the least populous city was Pidhaitsi, with 3,280 people.
