== Gallery activity ==


=== The Triptych gallery ===
Yuri Komelkov's gallery activity started with his purchasing the Triptych gallery (2003).
It's the first private gallery in the capital, founded in 1988 by 5 co-founders (Olexander Milovzorov, Volodymyr Isupov, Nelli Isupova, Nataliya Pikush and Nina Lapchik), artists, who set the central focus of its activity (fine and decorative art). For its popularity among artists, the writer Andriy Kurkov called it "the cornerstone of Andriyivskyy Descent". Its exhibitions got into the headlines. For instance, Den covered Lyudmila Bruyevich's exhibition, Zerkalo Nedeli wrote about Nelli Isupova's exhibition. The gallery exhibitions were also covered in foreign reports. Latvian daily Diena (Riga) announced Yanis Meletskis' exhibition, which was held under the aegis of Embassy of Latvia in Ukraine (1998).
At the moment of its being purchased, the gallery had a rich history but was in a poor condition. The new owner of the gallery restored the building and performed a full rebranding of the gallery. The institution started hosting regular expositions, participating in international projects, organizing annual plein-air events and publishing artists' catalogues. Fine arts (painting, sculpture, graphics) have become the main focus of the gallery. It was the first time that cutting-edge business technologies were used in the gallery activity of the capital. The large-scale work commenced by the owner of the gallery was aimed at creating Ukrainian business elite's demand for works of art.
2004 was a starting point for a series of grand projects characterized by a synthesis of publishing and gallery components. The book "Decorative art of Ukraine of the end of XXth century. The 200 names" was the first stage of the like-named project. The second stage was represented by the exhibition "The contemporary professional decorative art. Image transformation" in the Ukrainian House (2003). Over 1000 exhibits were displayed there. It was the most attended artistic event of the year. The art project was under the patronage of the president of Ukraine (2003). The final third stage was realized at the international level. It was presented in Paris by an exhibition at UNESCO headquarters, at festivities dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Ukrainian full membership in UNESCO (2004). The event was highly appraised by the Director-General of UNESCO, Kōichirō Matsuura, in his letter to the President of Ukraine. The project "200 names" travelled around Western Europe (France, Belgium, Netherlands).
To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, there was created an art project entitled "Bridge" — two like-named exhibitions in Kyiv and Paris, at UNESCO headquarters (France, 2006). The Triptych gallery represented Ukraine at one of the largest art fairs of Europe "Art Karlsruhe" (Karlsruhe, Germany; 2006). For several years the gallery participated in the International Contemporary Art Fair "Art-Manezh" (Moscow, Russia; 2006–2010).The gallery was represented at the International Artistic Forum "Art Vilnius '09" (Vilnius, Lithuania; 2009). It also took part in a major European art fair "20th Istanbul Art Fair" (Istanbul, Turkey; 2010).
The gallery also participated in domestic events, such as "Art Kyiv Contemporary" (Kyiv, 2006–2014), "Actual art week 2010" (Lviv).
The first artistic plein-air of the Triptych, entitled "The Glass House" (2003) was held in the Crimea, at Cape Aya. The second and the third plein-air events were held in Sozopol (Bulgaria, 2005–2006), in the territory of the former ancient Greek colony Apollonia Pontica. The third plain-air was attended by 15 artists. The results of the plein-air events were covered in catalogues.
After the presentation of the album-catalogue "Ivan Marchuk", the Triptych gallery hosted the largest exhibition of the artist's works, which occupied four floors of the Ukrainian House (2005). In 2013 the gallery hosted "Small sculpture salon", which exhibited 104 compositions by 25 sculptors.
The expositions were quite popular with central periodicals. For instance, Den wrote about varnishing days of such artists as Petro Bevza, Katerina Kosyanenko, Mykola Muravsky, Yana Katsuba, Vladyslav Shereshevsky, Oksana Stratiychuk, Ivan Marchuk. Khreschatik published reports on expositions of Vachagan Norazyan, Borys Firtsak, Matviy Vaisberg, Glib Vysheslavsky and Vira Vaisberg. Kommersant Ukraina wrote about Zviad Gogolauri's exhibition. Kapital announced Anatoly Kryvolap's varnishing day. Gazeta po Ukrainski published report on festivities dedicated to 25th anniversary of the gallery.
The Triptych gallery became a subject of academic studies. Oleg Minko's exhibition was considered in the collection of scientific papers of the Modern Art Research Institute of Ukrainian Academy of Arts. The exposition activity of the gallery is also mentioned in foreign catalogues, published in Poland (Lublin), Turkey (Istanbul).


=== Art-Blues Gallery ===
The company Art-Blues was established by Yuri Komelkov in 2002. It is a member of a business-related group, a group of companies called Foxtrot. The contemporary art gallery Art-Blues named after the company's owner, was founded in 2004. Its activity is coincident with that of the Triptych.
