== Early career ==
Iain Sutherland's parents were the Scottish artists David Macbeth Sutherland and Dorothy Johnstone. He was born in Edinburgh in 1925 and was educated at Fettes College, The University of Aberdeen and Balliol College, Oxford. Sutherland served with the Royal Artillery from 1944 to 1947, and entered the Diplomatic Service in 1950. After initially training in Russian, he was posted to Belgrade in 1956, became Head of Chancery in Havana, Cuba, in 1959 and was posted to Washington in 1962 immediately after the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was appointed Consul-general in Jakarta in 1967 and was head of the Foreign Office's South Asia department from 1969 to 1973 before being appointed as Minister in Moscow in 1974. After a sabbatical and fellowship in International Affairs at Harvard University, Sutherland was appointed British Ambassador to Greece in 1978 until 1982. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1982 New Year Honours.
