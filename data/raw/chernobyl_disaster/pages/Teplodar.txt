The city of Teplodar was founded on 15 May 1981. The intent of the city was to provide housing for the workers of an atomic thermal power station very close to the city which would provide power for Odesa. The development of the city was halted in 1986 after the Chernobyl disaster. In 1997 the construction of the station was completely canceled.
Until 18 July 2020, Teplodar was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Odesa Oblast to seven, the city of Teplodar was merged into newly established Odesa Raion.
