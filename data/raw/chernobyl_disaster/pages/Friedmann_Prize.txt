The Friedmann Prize is a Soviet and Russian physics prize, awarded for outstanding work in cosmology and gravity, as well as earth sciences. It is named after the Russian cosmologist Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann.
Between 1972 and 1990 the prize was awarded by the USSR Academy of Sciences for the best scientific work in the field of meteorology. It was re-established by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1993. It is generally awarded to a single scientist once every three years.
