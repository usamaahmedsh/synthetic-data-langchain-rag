Stroitel Football Club Pripyat (Russian: Футбольный клуб «Строитель» Припять, romanized: Futbol'nyy klub "Stroitel'" Pripyat'), also known as Budivelnyk Football Club Pripyat (Ukrainian: Футбольний клуб «Будівельник» Прип'ять, romanized: Futbol'nyy klub "Budivel'nyk" Pryp'yat') was a Soviet and Ukrainian football club (team) from Pripyat, Kyiv Oblast. Founded in the 1970s, it competed only at republican level competitions in Ukraine. Before the Chernobyl disaster the team was playing at a small stadium in Pripyat. In 1986, a new home ground, the Avanhard Stadium (Ukrainian: Стадіон «Авангард») was built but never used due to the disaster.


== History ==
The team, which name Stroitel means "builder", was founded in the middle of the 1970s with construction of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station along with the atomgrad Prypiat. Many players of the new club were from the village of Chystohalivka, 4 km (2.5 mi) south of Prypiat. The idea for establishment of the team belonged to Vasiliy Kizima, the director of the Construction Administration of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. At first the team was called as Komanda posyolka Pripyat (the Pripyat town team). In 1981 Kizima invited Anatoliy Shepel to coach the team, and the team obtained its first name "Budivelnyk" (Stroitel). The team was owned by the town of Pripyat, while the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had its own football team, which was called Enerhetyk Prypiat. However, the ChNPP employers played for either team.
The team competed in district (raion) and regional (oblast) competitions. In 1981, it entered the KFK competition of Ukrainian SSR.  Please note, at Soviet football league system such republican football competitions (KFK championship) in 1971–1989 were conditionally at fourth tier just below the USSR Championship Vtoraya Liga, yet republican competitions, particularly football KFK, were administered by all 15 union republics individually. Since 1978 every winner of the Ukrainian football competitions among KFK were gaining promotion and obtaining the status of teams of masters.
The club achieved its best result in 1985 by reaching the second place in its group. The team never qualified for the final stage of the competition. In 1981–1983, for three years in the row, Stroitel was awarded the title of the Kyiv Oblast championship champions.
Stroitel was preparing for a cup semi-final against FC Borodyanka on the day of the Chernobyl disaster, Saturday 26 April 1986. Following the disaster, some players of Budivelnyk participated in the post-disaster clean-up and became known as "Liquidators" (as liquidators of the Chernobyl disaster results). When the city of Pripyat was abandoned after the disaster, the new city of Slavutych was founded near Chernihiv at the end of the same year to replace it. The football club was moved there, changing its name to FC Stroitel Slavutych in 1987. Its activities ceased after the end of 1988 season.
Players who also worked at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant were receiving 25 Soviet rubles per game. According to Volodymyr Semykopov who played forward for Budivelnyk, the team always used formation 4-4-2.

== Infrastructure and equipment ==
The team used balls manufactured by the Hungarian company "Artek", since the balls from the Soviet manufacturers were of poor quality.
Beside the city central stadium, Avanhard Stadium, that was planned to be officially opened on 1 May 1986 (the International Labor Day, the second most important holiday in the Soviet Union), Prypiat had an indoor arena where footballers were practicing and polishing their skills.
