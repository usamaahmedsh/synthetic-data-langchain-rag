He held this post for eighteen years.

The former schools of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Ordzhonikidze, Saratov and Kharkov were repurposed to train the troops. Special motorized police units were created.

On December 24, 1986, he was relieved of his post after the Tu-134 hijacking in Ufa International Airport by servicemen of the 521st escort regiment of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs Matsnev and Yagmurzhi and the murder of several people, as well as a number of conflicts on this basis with the new Minister of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union, Aleksandr Vlasov. He was appointed military inspector-adviser to the Group of General Inspectors of the Soviet Ministry of Defense. Since 1992, he has been retired.
