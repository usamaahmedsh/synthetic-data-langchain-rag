There are 16 populated places in Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine, that have been officially granted city status (Ukrainian: місто, romanized: misto) by the Verkhovna Rada, the country's parliament. Settlements with more than 10,000 people are eligible for city status, although the status is typically also granted to settlements of historical or regional importance. As of 5 December 2001, the date of the first and only official census in the country since independence, the most populous city in the oblast was the regional capital, Cherkasy, with a population of 295,414 people, while the least populous city was Monastyryshche, with 9,463 people. In 2024, following the passage of derussification laws, the city of Vatutine was renamed Bahacheve.
From independence in 1991 to 2020, six cities in the oblast were designated as cities of regional significance (municipalities), which had self-government under city councils, while the oblast's remaining 10 cities were located amongst 26 raions (districts) as cities of district significance, which are subordinated to the governments of the raions. On 18 July 2020, an administrative reform abolished and merged the oblast's raions and cities of regional significance into four new, expanded raions. The four raions that make up the oblast are Cherkasy, Uman, Zolotonosha, and Zvenyhorodka.
