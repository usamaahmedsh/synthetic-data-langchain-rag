Founded in 1923, Aeroflot, the flag carrier and largest airline of Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), has had a high number of fatal crashes, with a total of 8,231 passengers dying in Aeroflot crashes according to the Aircraft Crashes Record Office, mostly during the Soviet era, about five times more than any other airline. From 1946 to 1989, the carrier was involved in 721 incidents. On the other hand, from 1995 to 2025, the carrier was involved in merely 11 incidents, out of which only 3 caused any fatalities. In 2013, AirlineRatings.com reported that five of the ten aircraft models involved in the highest numbers of fatal accidents were old Soviet models.
Aviation columnist Patrick Smith stated that Aeroflot's raw crash totals including the Soviet Union era may not give a total picture of the airline's safety record, because the airline was divided into pieces after the conclusion of the Soviet era; according to Smith, the size of Aeroflot's Soviet era operation was the equivalent of all of the large airlines in the United States at the time combined. In the Soviet Union, there was only one airline, that being Aeroflot.
Following is a list of accidents and incidents Aeroflot experienced from 1932 to the present.
