The unit is the successor of the 122nd Mobile Detachment which was formed in 1979 and was heavily involved in the Chernobyl Disaster cleanup. In late 1986 the unit was reformed as the 3rd Mobile Disaster Management Regiment which in 1989 formed the basis of the 1st Mobile NBC Protection Brigade. 
On January 25, 2024, the brigade was awarded the honorary title of "Guards" for mass heroism and bravery, fortitude and courage demonstrated by the brigade personnel in combat operations to defend the Fatherland and state interests in armed conflicts.
