== Political positions ==


=== Perspective on Politics ===
Kobrin said in a 2018 interview that allies exist in politics instead of friends, and ours could not get this. They were unaware that everyone who opposed the reds was an ally rather than a temporary opponent. For this reason, white people—Denikin's volunteer army, Kolchak, and gold seekers in general—had something in common despite their disparate political ideologies: they opposed Bolshevism. He went on to say that historians should study history, while politicians should study politics.


=== Great Patriotic War ===
Kobrin said in a 2020 interview that there was, in reality, more than one conflict for him. They refer to this as the Great Patriotic War that the people fought since it was the conflict that separated them from World War II and was fought by the Stalinist dictatorship. In actuality, the people prevailed in the Great Patriotic War while Stalin lost his Second World War. It was evident from the moment he produced "1941" that the Communist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were the two regimes that started World War II. Also, both systems competed for global dominance.
