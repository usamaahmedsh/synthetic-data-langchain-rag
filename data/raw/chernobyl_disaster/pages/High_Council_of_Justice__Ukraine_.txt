== History ==
The High Council of Justice (Ukrainian: Вища рада юстиції) was firstly introduced into Ukraine's legal system with the adoption of the 1996 Constitution.
On January 15, 1998, the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) adopted the law "On the High Council of Justice" (Ukrainian: "Про Вищу раду юстиції"). After that the majority of the initial Council members were appointed by the respective bodies.
The first official session of the council was held on March 31, 1998, and Valeri Yevdokimov was elected its first chairman.
In January 2017, the new law "On the High Council of Justice" (Ukrainian: "Про Вищу раду правосуддя") entered into force which re-established the council with the new Ukrainian name ("Вища рада правосуддя"), the new functions and change to its composition. In particular, the Council assumed from the Verkhovna Rada the functions to appoint judges and give consent to detain or arrest judges. The council also became responsible for disciplining and dismissing judges.
In 2021, the Ethics Council was legally defined by law No. 1635-IX, "On amendments to certain legislative acts of Ukraine concerning the procedure for selection (appointment) to the positions of members of the High Council of Justice and the activities of disciplinary inspectors of the High Council of Justice". In November 2021, the composition of the Ethics Council was set, with three Ukrainian members, Supreme Court judge Lev Kyshakevych, Kyiv Court of Appeal judge Yuriy Tryasun, and retired judge Volodymyr Siverin; and three international members, British retired judge Anthony Hooper, United States retired judge Robert J. Cordy and former Estonian prosecutor-general Lavly Perling. In June 2022, the Council started confirming, appointing and refusing members of the High Council of Justice. Anti-corruption organisations including AutoMaidan objected to the council's decisions.
On 1 June 2023 the High Council of Justice appointed all members of the new High Qualification Commission of Judges (HQCJ), which has been dysfunctional since the termination of the previous composition on October 19, 2019.
