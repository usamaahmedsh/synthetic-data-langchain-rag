This article presents a list of military occupations, both historic and contemporary, but only those that have taken place since the customary laws of belligerent military occupation were first clarified and supplemented by the Hague Convention of 1907.
As currently understood in international law, "military occupation" is the effective military control by a power of a territory outside of said power's recognized sovereign territory. The occupying power in question may be an individual state or a supranational organization, such as the United Nations.
