The Contemporary Historical Examination of Current Operations (CHECO), was a series of historical documents created by the United States Air Force History Office from 1964 through 1979, about operations in Southeast Asia, during the Vietnam War. The series produced over 200 reports – many have been declassified in the early 1990s.


== History ==
Project CHECO was an Air Force effort to document aerial operations in Southeast Asia, with emphasis on new forces, tactics and techniques, materials, and methods. The project was established by the Air Staff in June 1962, at the request of Lieutenant General Thomas S. Moorman, the vice commander of Pacific Air Forces. It was under the command of Headquarters Pacific Forces and the 2nd Air Division; which was redesignated 7th Air Force in April 1966. Over the course of 15 years, over 250 reports were established on topics that included command arrangements, training, air base defense, special operations, conventional air operations, and many others.
