== Education ==


=== Ophthalmology residency and fellowship ===
In July 2019, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai merged their ophthalmology programs to launch the largest ophthalmology residency program in the nation, with 10 residents per year.
The three-year ophthalmology residency training program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and offers matriculated residents clinical and surgical training as well as a range of research opportunities. Students accepted into the NYEE residency program participate in a one-year internal medicine program at Mount Sinai Beth Israel where they spend three months rotating in ophthalmology, and nine months in medicine, prior to starting their residency.
NYEE's Ophthalmology fellowships program offers ophthalmic subspecialties including cornea and external disease, glaucoma, retina, pediatric ophthalmology, uveitis, and ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery.


=== Otolaryngology residency ===
Following a merger between independent programs at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, the Otolaryngology Residency Program is the largest program in the country with six residents per training year. Subspecialties include otology-neurotology, rhinology, facial plastics, head and neck surgery, laryngology, pediatrics, and sleep.


=== Microsurgical education center ===
The Jorge N. Buxton, MD Microsurgical Education Center at New York Eye Infirmary of Mount Sinai is the center of ophthalmic and eye nose and throat education at NYEE. The microsurgical center provides ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists and plastic surgeons with opportunities for hands-on experience in a variety of surgical procedures before they surgically treat patients.
The Continuing Medical Education program supports the continuous professional development of physicians. Accredited by Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, the program includes live and enduring continuing medical education courses open to physicians and trainees nationally.


== History ==
The hospital was founded by Edward Delafield and John Kearny Rodgers. In 1816, upon graduating from the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons and completing their training at New York Hospital, the two native New Yorkers traveled to Europe to continue their medical studies. It was during their studies at the London Eye Infirmary, later famed as the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital (Moorfields) that Rodgers and Delafield realized how little attention ophthalmology received in the Americas and set about to change that. Upon their return to New York in 1818, they made the first survey of eye diseases in city. Finding a glaring lack of eye care provided to the poor, except in dire circumstances, and little interest in the medical community or city authorities in offering competent eye care, Delafield and Rodgers opened the New York Eye Infirmary. Founded on August 14, 1820, the first Infirmary was located at 45 Chatham Street (which is now 83 Park Row), across from City Hall and near the Five Points neighborhood.
On April 21, 1821, the first bylaws and rules and regulations were drawn up, and a Board of Directors, called "The Society of the New York Eye Infirmary," was formed. Early supporters of the Infirmary included prominent New Yorkers such as Colonel William Few – who became the first President of the Infirmary Board from 1821 to 1828, Philip Hone, Benjamin Strong and David Hosack – the founder of Bellevue Hospital, who contributed funds and helped raise money for the fledgling clinic. The hospital was incorporated by the New York State Legislature on March 22, 1822.


=== Name changes ===
At the time of its incorporation, on March 22, 1822, the hospital was named The New York Eye Infirmary. Although NYEE treated ear conditions since its inception, the otology department received official recognition in 1864 by an act of the state legislature and the name was legally changed to The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.
Following the 2013 merger between Continuum Health Partners, Inc., and The Mount Sinai Medical Center, the hospital name was officially changed to New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai.
In 2022, the facility was reported to be closing and up for sale, with the specialty emergency department already closed.


=== Main campus and prior locations ===
Delafield and Rodgers opened the New York Eye Infirmary on August 14, 1820 at 45 Chatham Street (which is now 83 Park Row), across from City Hall and near the Five Points neighborhood. To accommodate a growing volume of patients, NYEE's main campus expanded several times between 1878 and 1903 to include new pavilions: Abram Du Bois Pavilion (1894), James N. Platt Pavilion (1901), and the William C. Schermerhorn Pavilion (1903), designed by Robert Williams Gibson. NYEE expanded its footprint in 1968, with the opening of the North Building on East 14th Street and Second Avenue. In 1974, a new building to house Residents expanded the campus at 321 East 13th Street.

== Community outreach ==
In 2009, the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary worked in partnership with departments at Continuum Health Partners, Inc., on "Project Chernobyl", to diagnose and treat thyroid cancer associated with radiation exposure from the Chernobyl disaster, which can take decades to develop. Thyroid cancer is a risk among some 200,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union who now live the New York area.
The infirmary is a member of the Partners in Preparedness Program with the  New York City office of Emergency Management. It welcomes volunteers for opportunities ranging from administration to patient services.


== In popular culture ==
In 1903, Helen Keller delivered a speech at the dedication of the infirmary's Schermerhorn Pavilion.
The interior of the old infirmary was used in The Godfather for the scenes in which Mafia Don Vito Corleone is in the hospital after being shot, and his son, Michael Corleone, attempts to protect him against gunmen trying to kill him.
