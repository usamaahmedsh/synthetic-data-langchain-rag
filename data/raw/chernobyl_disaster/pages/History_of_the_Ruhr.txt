The actual boundaries of the Ruhr vary slightly depending on the source, but a good working definition is to define the Lippe and Ruhr as its northern and southern boundaries respectively, the Rhine as its western boundary, and the town of Hamm as the eastern limit.
In the Middle Ages, local power was vested primarily in the counts (Grafen) of Berg, Mark and Cleves. The left bank of the Rhine was held by the Archbishop of Cologne. The Hellweg was an important trade route crossing the region from Duisburg to Dortmund and beyond as far as the rivers Weser and Elbe. The most important towns of the region were concentrated along the Hellweg.
As a result of the Congress of Vienna, the entire area came under the control of Prussia (the state had already gained possessions there). This event was almost concomitant with developments which would eventually make the region one of the most important industrial areas in the world.
In 1946, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia came into being centred on the Ruhr.  Nowadays, its hitherto important coal and steel industries have drastically declined and the region is in a state of re-adjustment.


== Carboniferous period ==

During the Carboniferous Period, in the Paleozoic era, which began 360 million years ago and ended 300 million years ago, layers of slate, coal and sandstone were formed. 400 to 300 million years ago, new mountains were uplifted during the Variscan mountain-building period.
During the Silesian period, layers were deposited which became seams of coal over a period lasting millions of years. During this period there was a constant shifting between marshy conditions and overflowing seas such that the depositing of plant material and sediment from the sea resulted in the current situation of coal layers separated by stone layers.
The main representatives of flora in the coal marshes were of the genus Lepidodendron and genus Sigillaria, tree-like plants, which belong to the plant classification Lycopodiophyta. Members of both genus reached heights of up to 40 meters with a trunk diameter of over a meter.


== Cretaceous Period ==

In the Cretaceous, 135 million to about 66 million years ago, the region was submerged under a tropical ocean. In its waters lived ammonites. On the floor of the sea, a thick layer of marl formed. The sediments covered the layers of carbon and contained also the shells of giant ammonites.


== Quaternary ==
The Ice Age brought changes between warm and cold weather. During the Drenthe Stadium of the Wolstonian Stage, an ice sheet over Northern Germany covered the Ruhr and reached as far as the northern hills of the Central Uplands. The shape of the middle and lower Ruhr valley is due to meltwaters and the powerful force of the ice. Meltwater from the glaciers flowed westwards through the Ruhr valley. Where Essen lies today, this flow was temporarily hindered by a barrier of ice and rocky debris, forming an enormous lake which filled the valley at Schwerte.


== Pre-history ==
80,000 B.C. – The region of the present-day Ruhr was already settled during the  Neanderthal period, around 80,000 years ago. During the building of the Rhine-Herne Canal in 1911,  stone tools and traces of encampment with bones from woolly rhinoceros, bison and mammoth were found in Herne. Humanoids also settled elsewhere in the Emscher valley. Similar finds in the 1960s were made in Bottrop.
8700 BC. – In November 1978 stone-age flint instruments were found on the Kaiserberg in Duisburg which belong to the later phases of the last Ice Age and can be dated to about 9000 to 8000 BC. The oldest remains of modern humans in the area of the current Ruhr stem from the early Middle Stone Age. They were discovered in Spring 2004 in the Blätterhöhle in Hagen-Hohenlimburg.
6000–4500 BC –  several settlements are known in the regions of  Bochum, Hagen and Dortmund from the Linear Pottery culture and the Rössen culture. In Spring 2004, the skeletons of several humans from the Michelsberg culture were discovered in the Blätterhöhle in Hagen-Hohenlimburg. Among them was the skeleton of a 17–22-year woman. These finds are the single source of information for burials from this period in the current Rhine-Ruhr district.


== Antiquity ==

100 BC – Threat to the Celtic inhabitants by the Germanic Sicambri
12 BC – Construction of the Roman camp Asciburgium on the present-day boundary between Moers and Duisburg, the Kastell Werthhausen in present-day  Duisburg-Rheinhausen and the legionary camp  Vetera at Birten left of the  Rhine and therefore on the boundary of the district and the later province of Germania Inferior.

== Early Middle Ages ==
695 – At the end of the 7th century, Christian missionaries from France are active in the neighbouring districts of the Frankish Bructeri. A wave of Saxon settlers certainly halted the religious conversion.

The Königshof in Duisburg is extended to a Königspfalz.
971 – Mathilde, granddaughter of Otto I becomes abbess of Essen Abbey.

Furthermore, he gives over his castle and his fortune to the young order. Gottfried thereby becomes the last of the mighty counts of Cappenberg. His younger brother Otto of Cappenberg was godfather of Frederick I of Staufen. In 1155, Otto received as a gift from the recently crowned king the famous Cappenberg bust reliquary, a reliquary in the form of a bust of Frederick.
1123 – Kamp Abbey becomes the first Cistercian monastery in the German-speaking area.

1254 – Battle on the Wülferichskamp east of Dortmund
1283–1289 – War of the Limburg Succession. The weakened position of the ducal power, i.e. the Archbishop of Cologne, after the Battle of Worringen in 1288, hardens the powerful position enjoyed by the counts. In the Ruhr, this applies especially to the participants in the conflict – the  counts of Berg and Mark, but also indirectly to the neutral Count of Cleves.
1290 – Duisburg is 'mortgaged' to the Count of Cleves – it  ends up finally under the possession of Cleves (presumably because the Emperor did not have enough finance at his disposal to buy it back).

During action in the territory of Dortmund,  the Steinerne Turm is besieged and damaged.
1486 – Two Landtag sittings agree to the raising of a special  tax in the Grafschaft Mark for the benefit of  Duke John II of Cleves. The relevant account book, the Schatboick in Mark, contains a note of all tax obligations and thereby contains much information on the district.

1583–1589 – The Cologne War is waged across large regions of the Vest Recklinghausen, which thereby suffered badly from the war. The background to the war are the demands of the Archbishop and Elector of Cologne, Gebhard I of Waldburg, over the equality of the confession, connected with the intention to transform the Electorate of Cologne into a secular principality.
1587 –  Dutch-occupied Ruhrort was besieged and conquered by Spanish troops during the  Eighty Years' War.
1598 – The Spanish send troops into Vest Recklinghausen and the County of Mark. Among other towns, Recklinghausen was taken by General Francisco de Mendoza and his 24,000 soldiers. In 1599, his troops are before the town of Dortmund and the surrounding area is plundered. During the Eighty Years' War involving the Netherlands, the bordering areas of the Lower Rhine and Westphalia are crossed repeatedly by both Spanish and Dutch troops. Castrop, for example, suffers greatly from plundering.

1756–1763 – Seven Years' War. This was a major international conflict in which Prussian was aligned with Britain (and Hanover) among others, against France, Austria and Russia. Prussia was very nearly brought to its knees but appears to have been saved by the death of the Russian Empress Elizabeth and the more conciliatory attitudes of the new czar, Peter III. In 1758, the Battle of Rheinberg preceded the more crucial Battle of Krefeld during which Hanoverian/Prussian troops pushed the French army across the Rhine.
1758 – On 18 October, a new nine-meter high blast furnace of the  St Antony Smeltery in Osterfeld (in present-day Oberhausen) was used for the first time. The first ore-based production in the district.

These locks were necessary to circumvent obstacles such as weirs and were constructed in tandem with other measures such as widening and dredging needed to make the Ruhr navigable. It became extremely well used, primarily for coal, although traffic fell off with the later construction of railways and the advance of the coalfield northwards. At this time, coal was being extracted from shallow  drift mines in the vicinity of the river. Of particular importance, a toll road, the Aktienstrasse, carried coal to the river at Mülheim an der Ruhr.

The new method of brine production produced such an increase in production that by the following year  The saltworks was already occupying third place among all salt-producing companies in Prussia for its productivity.


== First half of the 19th century – Industrial Revolution ==
The Industrial Revolution advances in the Ruhr. At the start of the 19th century, the steam engine is used there for the first time, and Napoleonic measures abolish feudal influences. When the entire area comes under Prussian hegemony in 1815, further advances are made in transportation and encouragement of industry. By the 1830s, the important deep-lying coking-coal seams of the Emscher Basin are reached for the first time, railways make their appearance and in 1849 smelting iron ore with coke is successfully carried out for the first time in the Ruhr.

1801 – The annexation of the left bank of the Rhine by the French was recognized in the  Peace of Lunèville on  9 February 1801.

1815 – Vienna Congress at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Prussia regains its possessions in Westphalia and on the Rhine, to which are added the former Duchy of Berg and the territories of the former  Reichsstadt (imperial city) and Grafschaft Dortmund. As a result, all territories on the Ruhr, Emscher and lower Rhine are united under one regime. The area to the East belongs to the  Prussian   Province of Westphalia and  that to the West to its  Rheinprovinz.
1816 – The Year Without a Summer (on 25 June there was even a fall of snow) brings hunger.
1816 – The Bochum Mining College is founded. Leading personnel for the mines are trained there.

1839 – Even while the railway was still being built in the northern part of the Ruhr, the Cologne banking house of Camphausen und Schaafhausen started to interest themselves in the resulting potential for growth in the Emscherland. The Cologne Mining Association was founded as an early Aktiengesellschaft of Ruhr mines (including shaft mines) in Northern Essen, among them the Carl Mine.

1849 – For the first time in the Ruhr, coke was used for  steel production  – in the Frederick William Smeltery in Mülheim.


== Second half of the 19th century – industry booms ==
The advances made in the first half of the century were built upon, producing a significant advance in production. In 1850, the district produced 2 million tonnes of coal, by 1913 it produced 114 million tonnes. Likewise, in 1850 it produced 11,500 tonnes of cast iron which rose by 1913 to 8.2 million tonnes. Coal production moved northwards as steam engine technology allowed the exploitation of deep coking coal seams (the earlier mines, generally nearer the River Ruhr, had tended to be drift mines exploiting the anthracite lying nearer the surface). 'Vertical' concerns came into being, with collieries, cokeries and ironworks under common ownership, and it was not uncommon to have all constituents located on the same site or close together.

1854 – In Hattingen, the Henrichshütte is founded. Initially, ore is available in the immediate neighborhood. Later  the Ruhr Valley Railway transported  ore and coal to the works. In Hörde a blast furnace using coke was also employed for the first time. It was meant to work with the local Kohleneisenstein, a mixture of Eisenstein with clay and coal.
1855 – Under the supervision of William Thomas Mulvany the sinking of the first shaft of the Hibernia Mine in Gelsenkirchen is begun. As a technical innovation, tubbings was used for the shaft lining. In the following years, Mulvaney had a hand in the opening of several mines in the Emscherniederung, among them  the Shamrock Mine in Herne und the Erin Mine in Castrop. The money came from Irish and Belgian financiers. Their coal was transported over the Cologne-Minden Railway.
1856 – A railway along the right bank of the Rhine connects Oberhausen with Arnhem in the Netherlands.

1867 – August Thyssen with several relatives founds das Eisenwerk "Thyssen-Foussol & Co." in Duisburg. (This is dissolved in 1870 and a new company founded in Müheim in 1871. Thyssen was involved in several organizations which were only later unified under one holding company)
1869 – The industrialist Alfred Krupp starts building the Villa Hügel  in Southern Essen. In the  'Grundbuch der Stadt' he enters the  estate as a family house with garden. Four years later, the building is finished.
1870–1871 – The Franco-Prussian War is won by the united German states. Founding of the German Reich.
1871–1873 – The so-called Gründerjahre. The French reparations lead to a building boom. In the Ruhr, numerous mining companies are founded with the help of the capital flowing in from France.
1873 – Crisis (Gründerkrise) – because of speculation by German investors, capital from the French reparations flowed into Ruhr mining companies, without the additional capital requirements from the mine share certificates being covered. Steel production in the Ruhr dropped by 13%.
 1882 – On 24 February 1882 fifteen Rheinish and Westfälish steelworks formed themselves into a cartel to protect themselves from competition.
1889 – A mass strike of miners spreads from Bochum to encompass the entire Ruhr. The workers demand a share in the profits of the companies whose production was stabilising after the years of the Gründerkrise. In the same year, the first  permanent miners' union, the "Alten Verband" was founded in Dortmund-Dorstfeld. In 1894, a Christian union was also founded and in 1902 a Polish miners' union.
1892 – The Grillo Theatre is opened in Essen.
1893 – Formation of the Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate with its head office in Essen, as an association of a large number of Ruhr mines. Its aim is to regulate production, marketing and prices. Sales are organized at a central point.
1893 – In Essen the first electric tram in Rhine-Ruhr starts operating.

1895 – The later Social Democratic Reichstag Member Otto Hue becomes editor of the Berg- und Hüttenarbeiterzeitung of the Alten Bergarbeiterverbandes. Soon Hue, because of his job, becomes known as the Sprecher der Bergarbeiter (speaker for the miners).

1913 – Under the influence of the work of Karl Imhoff on the cleaning-up of the Ruhr, the Ruhrreinhaltungsgesetz (law concerned with cleaning up the Ruhr) is introduced. At the same time, the work of the Ruhrtalsperrenvereins (the dams) is regulated by the  Ruhrtalsperrengesetz (law concerned with the damming of the Ruhr). Both laws contribute significantly in ensuring the water supply of the growing conurbation.
1914 – Opening of the Rhine-Herne-Canal, which becomes the most-used inland canal in Europe. It makes a connection between the Rhine at Duisburg and Herne, from where it connects to the Dortmund-Ems-Canal.

1936 – Jewish business owners were dispossessed, like for example the Gebr. Alsberg.
1938 – During Kristallnacht, the  synagoges in most Ruhr towns were destroyed, such as the  Alte Synagoge in Dortmund. The construction of the Old Synagoge in Essen is so robust that it proves impossible to blow it up without damaging the surrounding buildings – therefore the building remained standing, although its interior was desecrated and burnt out.
1938 – In Drewer Mark in Marl, the Chemischen Werke Hüls is founded. It is largely a subsidiary of IG. Farben. During the Third Reich, synthetic rubber, Buna, was produced there for tyres. Slave labor was also used for production.
1939 – The Second World War began on 1 September.
1943 – Allied Bombing of the Ruhr destroys over 65% of houses in several cities, such as Dortmund and Duisburg. In Essen more than half the houses are destroyed. Thousands of people lose their lives. The centres of towns along the Hellweg zone lie almost completely in rubble.
