This timeline of Spanish July 1936 coup lists events which took place during 4 days between July 17 and July 20.
While the start date is non-controversial, in historiography there is no agreement as to the end-date. It is widely accepted that technically speaking, the coup failed and the conflict assumed the format of a civil war. However, it is not clear at which point the coup might be considered over, and almost all works present the coup as an early stage of the general phenomenon known as the Spanish Civil War. Some works suggest that the coup turned into war on July 19; others advance the date of July 20; some claim that the August/September airlift turned the failed coup into the war, and some point even to November 1936, when the Nationalists were defeated at the gates of Madrid. As this entry is supposed to provide possibly detailed timeline, it is limited to the first 80 hours of the conflict.
Hours are stated in WET, used in Morocco protectorate and most of Spain at the time; this applies also to events in the Canary Islands, the region which used UTC−01:00. Time is rounded to full-hour or half-hour, unless the exact hour is known.
