== Awards of the President of Ukraine for Courage ==
Before August, 1996, personal bravery had been honoured with Awards of the President of Ukraine for Courage: the Star for Courage and the Cross for Courage instituted on April 29, 1995. On August 21, 1996, they were transformed into three classes of the Order for Courage. Recipients of Awards of the President of Ukraine, such as the Star for Courage and the Cross for Courage, are considered to be equal to the recipients of the Order for Courage and they are recognised as holders of the Order for Courage retaining the right to wear decorations that have been granted. Granting the Star For Courage and the Cross for Courage was discontinued following the institution of the Order for Courage.
