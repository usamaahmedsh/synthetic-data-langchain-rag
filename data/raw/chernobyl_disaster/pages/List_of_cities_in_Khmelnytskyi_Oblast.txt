There are 13 populated places in Khmelnytskyi Oblast, Ukraine, that have been officially granted city status (Ukrainian: місто, romanized: misto) by the Verkhovna Rada, the country's parliament. Settlements with more than 10,000 people are eligible for city status, although the status is typically also granted to settlements of historical or regional importance. As of 5 December 2001, the date of the first and only official census in the country since independence, the most populous city in the oblast was the regional capital, Khmelnytskyi, with a population of 253,994 people, while the least populous city was Derazhnia, with 10,446 people. For its contributions to the country's defense during the Russian invasion, one city in the oblast, Starokostiantyniv, was awarded with the honorary title Hero City of Ukraine in 2025.
From independence in 1991 to 2020, six cities in the oblast were designated as cities of regional significance (municipalities), which had self-government under city councils, while the oblast's remaining seven cities were located amongst twenty raions (districts) as cities of district significance, which are subordinated to the governments of the raions. On 18 July 2020, an administrative reform abolished and merged the oblast's raions and cities of regional significance into three new, expanded raions. The three raions that make up the oblast are Kamianets-Podilskyi, Khmelnytskyi, and Shepetivka.
