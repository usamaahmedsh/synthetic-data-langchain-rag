Caesium (55Cs) has 41 known isotopes, ranging in mass number from 112 to 152. Only one isotope, 133Cs, is stable. The longest-lived radioisotopes are 135Cs with a half-life of 1.33 million years, 137Cs with a half-life of 30.04 years and 134Cs with a half-life of 2.0650 years. All other isotopes have half-lives less than 2 weeks, most under an hour.
Caesium is an abundant fission product (135 and 137 are directly produced) and various isotopes are of concern as such, see the sections below.
Beginning in 1945 with the commencement of nuclear testing, caesium radioisotopes were released into the atmosphere, where caesium is absorbed readily into solution and is returned to the surface of the Earth as a component of radioactive fallout. Once caesium enters the ground water, it is deposited on soil surfaces and removed from the landscape primarily by particle transport. As a result, the input function of these isotopes can be estimated as a function of time.

== Caesium-131 ==
Caesium-131 decays purely by electron capture to the ground state of stable xenon-131 with a half-life of 9.69 days; its detectable radiation is the X-rays of xenon, with a maximum energy of 34.5 keV. It was introduced in 2004 for brachytherapy by Isoray.


== Caesium-133 ==
Caesium-133 is the only stable isotope of caesium. The SI base unit of time, the second, is defined by a specific caesium-133 transition. Since 1967, the official definition of a second is:

The second, symbol s, is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, ΔνCs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be 9192631770 Hz, which is equal to s−1.


== Caesium-134 ==
Caesium-134 has a half-life of 2.0650 years. It is produced both directly (at a very small yield because 134Xe is stable) as a fission product and via neutron capture from nonradioactive 133Cs (neutron capture cross section 29 barns), which is a common fission product. It is not produced by nuclear weapons because 133Cs is created by beta decay of original fission products only long after the nuclear explosion is over.
The combined yield of 133Cs and 134Cs is given as 6.7896%. The proportion between the two will change with continued neutron irradiation. 134Cs also captures neutrons with a cross section of 140 barns, becoming long-lived radioactive 135Cs.
Caesium-134 undergoes beta decay (β−), producing stable 134Ba after emitting on average 2.23 gamma ray photons (mean energy 0.698 MeV).


== Caesium-135 ==

Caesium-135 is a mildly radioactive isotope of caesium with a half-life of 1.33 million years. It decays via emission of a low-energy beta particle into the stable isotope barium-135. Caesium-135 is one of the seven long-lived fission products and the only alkaline one. In most types of nuclear reprocessing, it stays with the medium-lived fission products (including 137Cs which can only be separated from 135Cs via isotope separation) rather than with other long-lived fission products. As an exception, molten salt reactors create 135Cs as a completely separate stream outside the fuel (after the decay of bubble-separated 135Xe). The low decay energy, lack of gamma radiation, and long half-life of 135Cs make this isotope much less hazardous than 137Cs or 134Cs.
Its precursor 135Xe has a high fission product yield (e.g., 6.3333% for 235U and thermal neutrons) but also has the highest known thermal neutron capture cross section of any nuclide. Because of this, much of the 135Xe produced in current thermal reactors (as much as >90% at steady-state full power) will be converted to practically stable 136Xe before it can decay to 135Cs despite the relatively short half-life of 135Xe. Little or no 135Xe will be destroyed by neutron capture after a reactor shutdown, or in a molten salt reactor that continuously removes xenon from its fuel, a fast neutron reactor, or a nuclear weapon. The xenon pit is a phenomenon of excess neutron absorption through 135Xe buildup in the reactor after a reduction in power or a shutdown and is often managed by letting the 135Xe decay away to a level at which neutron flux can be safely controlled via control rods again.
A nuclear reactor will also produce much smaller amounts of 135Cs from the nonradioactive fission product 133Cs by successive neutron capture to 134Cs and then 135Cs.
The thermal neutron capture cross section and resonance integral of 135Cs are 8.3 ± 0.3 and 38.1 ± 2.6 barns respectively. Disposal of 135Cs by nuclear transmutation is difficult, because of the low cross section as well as because neutron irradiation of mixed-isotope fission caesium produces more 135Cs from stable 133Cs. In addition, the intense medium-term radioactivity of 137Cs makes handling of nuclear waste difficult.

== Caesium-136 ==
Caesium-136 has a half-life of 13.01 days. It is produced both directly (at a very small yield because 136Xe is beta-stable) as a fission product and via neutron capture from long-lived 135Cs, though because of the lower cross-section (see above) and sort half-life, is much less abundant in spent fuel and vanishes quickly. It is also not produced by nuclear weapons because 135Cs is created by beta decay of original fission products only long after the nuclear explosion is over. Caesium-136 undergoes beta decay (β−) to 136Ba.


== Caesium-137 ==

Caesium-137, with a half-life of 30.04 years, is one of the two principal medium-lived fission products, along with 90Sr, which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel from several years up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the Chernobyl accident and is a major health concern for decontaminating land near the Fukushima nuclear power plant. 137Cs beta decays to barium-137m (a short-lived nuclear isomer), which in de-excitation to its stable ground state barium-137, usually emits a gamma ray. This process is responsible for all the gamma emission from caesium-137.
137Cs has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot yet be feasibly disposed of in this way unless advances in neutron beam collimation (not otherwise achievable by magnetic fields), uniquely available only from within muon catalyzed fusion experiments (not in the other forms of Accelerator Transmutation of Nuclear Waste) enables production of neutrons at high enough intensity to offset and overcome these low capture rates; until then, therefore, 137Cs must simply be allowed to decay.
137Cs has been used as a tracer in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of 3H.


== Fission-produced isotopes of caesium ==
The heavier isotopes have half-lives of seconds or minutes. Almost all caesium produced from nuclear fission comes from beta decay of originally more neutron-rich fission products, passing through isotopes of iodine then isotopes of xenon. Because these elements are volatile and can diffuse through nuclear fuel or air, caesium (thus its higher-Z decay products) is often created far from the original site of fission.
