The Kiev Military District (Russian: Киевский военный округ (КВО), romanized: Kiyevskiy voyennyy okrug (KVO); Ukrainian: Червонопрапорний Київський військовий округ, romanized: Chervonoprapornyi Kyivskyi viiskovyi okruh, lit. 'Red Banner Kyiv Military District', abbreviated КВО, KVO) was a military district of the Imperial Russian Army and subsequently of the Red Army and Soviet Armed Forces. It was first formed in 1862, and was headquartered in Kiev (Kyiv) for most of its existence.


== Imperial Russian Army formation ==

The Kiev Military District was an imperial military district, a territorial division type utilised to provide more efficient management of army units, their training and other operations activities related to combat readiness. The district originally covered the Kiev Governorate, Podolia Governorate (less Balta County), and Volhynia Governorate.
Assigned formations included the 10th Army.
In 1888, the Kharkov Military District was merged into the Kiev Military District.
With the start of World War I the district was transformed into the 3rd Army. In April 1917, Poltava and Kursk governorates were transferred under the administration of the Moscow Military District.
After the October Revolution in Petrograd, the district came under jurisdiction of the Ukrainian People's Republic and existed until the early February 1918 advance of the Petrograd-Moscow Russian Red Guards forces of the Antonov's Task Force that was charged by Vladimir Lenin to "fight counter-revolution in the Southern Russia", but was in fact invading Ukraine in what would become known as the Ukrainian–Soviet War.
The district was not reinstated during the brief Bolshevik period in 1918 nor after the establishment of the independent Ukrainian State.

Units stationed in the District were the 1st Guards Army and 6th Guards Tank Army. 69th Air Army was active from the early 1950s to at least 1964 in the district (see ru:Колесник, Василий Артёмович).

Then-Colonel Nikolay Antoshkin was chief of staff of the VVS KVO at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, and led helicopter operations to respond to the accident, dropping tonnes of sand and lead onto the exposed reactor core.
