Mordechai Twersky (c. 1770–1837), known as Motele, was a Ukrainian rabbi. He was the son of Rabbi Menachem Nachum Twersky of Chernobyl and the second rebbe of the Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty. The family surname is Russian for "native of Tver",  although Hasidic tradition connects it with the city of Tiberias. Seven of his eight sons were rebbes, from whom several branches of Hasidism emerged, including Skver, Chernobyl and Rachmastrivka.
