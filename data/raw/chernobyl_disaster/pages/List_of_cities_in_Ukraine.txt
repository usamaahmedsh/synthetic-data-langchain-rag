There are 463 populated places in Ukraine that have been officially granted city status (Ukrainian: місто, romanized: misto) by the Verkhovna Rada, the country's parliament, as of 23 April 2025. Settlements with more than 10,000 people are eligible for city status although the status is typically also granted to settlements of historical or regional importance.
Smaller settlements are rural settlements (Ukrainian: селище, romanized: selyshche) and villages (Ukrainian: село, romanized: selo).
Historically, there were systems of city rights, granted by the territorial lords, which defined the status of a place as a misto or selo. In the past, cities were self-governing and had several privileges.
The list of cities is roughly ordered by population and the 2022 estimates are compared to the 2001 Ukrainian census, except for Chernobyl for which the population is an unofficial estimate. The cities with special status are shown in italic. The average population size is 62,000.
