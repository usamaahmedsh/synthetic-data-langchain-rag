The Generation of '36 (Spanish: Generación del 36) is the name given to a group of Spanish artists, poets and playwrights who were working about the time of the Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939).
The Generation of '36 was a literary movement that suffered harsh criticism and persecution that followed from the division of neighbours into winners and losers in the various battles of that struggle, as well as from the physical hardships and moral miseries arising from social instability and political chaos. 
Ricardo Gullón listed some of the authors associated with this movement since he was closely associated as a contributor and a literary critic of the genre.
The Generation of '36 had membership criteria that were not rigid, but the label provides a convenient portfolio of the cultural and literary style of the contemporary period, covering individual works, literary collections, magazines, journals newspapers and other publications that document the experiences of creative people working during the difficult and frightening civil war.
