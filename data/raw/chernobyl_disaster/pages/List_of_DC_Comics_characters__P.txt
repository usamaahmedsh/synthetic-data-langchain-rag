During their battle, Powers is exposed to the gas and subjects himself to radiation treatments to save his life, which interacts with the gas and causes his body to become radioactive and translucent.

Within the stories' context, Mikhail Arkadin is a nuclear technician who worked at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. During the meltdown that occurred there, Arkadin's metagene was activated and he gained the ability to convert matter into energy. He was subsequently recruited by Major Zastrow of the Red Shadow as one of the Soviet Union's official superheroes. However, he is forced to wear a containment suit to prevent himself from destroying everything he touches.
In 1986, John Ostrander became the writer of the Firestorm title following Gerry Conway's departure from DC Comics. His first major story arc pitted Firestorm (Ronnie Raymond) against the world, as the hero (acting on a suggestion from a terminally ill Martin Stein) demands that the U.S. and the Soviet Union destroy all of their nuclear weapons. After tussles with the Justice League and most of his enemies, Firestorm faces off against Pozhar in the Nevada desert, where both have an atomic bomb dropped on them. The two are fused into a new Firestorm controlled by the disembodied, amnesiac mind of Martin Stein.
It is later revealed that Firestorm is a fire elemental and that Stein had originally been intended to be the fire elemental by himself: the inclusion of others in the Firestorm entity, such as Raymond and Arkadin, had been accidental. Stein becomes the sole Firestorm and leaves Earth, leaving Raymond and Arkadin powerless.
In "The New 52" reboot, Arkadin helped Stein invent the Firestorm Protocols.
In Doomsday Clock, Pozhar appears as a member of the People's Heroes and closes Russia's borders to all foreigners, be they metahuman or not.

== Molly Preacher ==


== Prestor Jon ==


== Preus ==
Preus is a supervillain who first appeared in The Adventures of Superman #625 (April 2004) and was created by Joe Kelly and Talent Caldwell as part of their "Godfall" arc.
For years, Preus had proudly served the Citizen's Patrol Corps, a police force that kept the peace in Kandor under the Kryptonian banner of El, their "creator". Due to the compression of time, more than a century had passed inside the bottle city (compared to only a handful of years outside it) during which Preus and his fellow Kandorians had come to worship "The Superman" as their "god in heaven" above. The Corpsman was also a devout xenophobe, who dispensed justice against "non-K" (Kryptonian) dissidents that threatened their way of life, especially a citizen named Kal-El, who tainted Paradise when he seemingly murdered several Kandorians.
Preus swore a solemn oath to make the murderer pay, not realizing that Kal-El was the Superman that he and the others had worshiped for so long. He was also unaware that the "victims" were constructs created by an alien telepath, Lyla, who had brainwashed Kal-El into believing that Kandor was a never-exploded Krypton. Eventually shattering the illusion, Superman escaped Kandor and confronted Lyla back in Metropolis. Preus followed them, but exposure to Earth's air and yellow sun drastically affected him, giving him strange, new powers equal to Superman's while amplifying his already-unbalanced racist views.
Convinced that Kal-El had defiled the legacy of "The Superman", Preus swore to assume that responsibility himself and that all of the impure would die by his hand. His xenophobia led him to a group of white supremacists in the American desert, who he forced into worshiping him and his views. However, in time, the people of "God's Peake" (as the camp was called) came to worship Preus as their cult leader. His increasing prominence eventually led both the Martian Manhunter and Jimmy Olsen to investigate, only to have both of them captured by Preus and his men.
This forced a confrontation with Superman, who, at the time, was dealing with the effects of Gog's synthetic yellow kryptonite, which had significantly aged and weakened Superman in a short period of time. So weakened, Superman was barely able to deal with Preus' legions alone and quickly found himself outclassed by Preus.
A last-ditch gambit using kryptonite to try and weaken Preus failed, as Preus revealed a previously unknown resistance to kryptonite. He was finally defeated when Superman attacked and destroyed a key portion of Preus' armor, rendering him unconscious. Afterwards, Preus was injured from that attack and had to be hospitalized. His current whereabouts are unknown. He was last seen as a weakened Superman tried to fly him to S.T.A.R. Labs for treatment. Preus disappeared after Superman was engaged by an army of Gogs.


=== Powers and abilities ===

The Puzzler is a name used by three supervillains in the DC Universe.


=== First version ===
The concept and original character, created by Jerry Siegel and John Sikela, first appeared in Action Comics #49 (June 1942). 
The original Puzzler is an unnamed non-costumed criminal who is skilled in parlor games and puzzles and operates a protection racket in Metropolis. The character, along with most of the Golden Age Superman material, was later assigned to the universe of Earth-Two in the DC Multiverse, before being removed from continuity during Crisis on Infinite Earths.


=== Second version ===
The name of the Puzzler was reused in Superman (vol. 2) #187 (December 2002) as the supervillain identity of Valerie van Haaften, a new version of the character whose body was composed of living "puzzle pieces". In the first appearance, as "Puzzler", she admits that she is a large fan of Superman's, and initially attempted to join several super groups to no avail. Thus, she decided that she would become a villain to gain his attention. Her body is composed of multiple large "puzzle pieces" that she can fully control, even when they are not directly attached to her. Superman disperses her with his super breath.
The Puzzler reappeared in Superman: Up, Up and Away! during the "One Year Later" story arc as an assassin hired by Intergang to kill Clark Kent. When she sees Superman, she decides to attempt to kill him instead to become famous. During the fight, she reveals she has been "upgraded" to have pieces that are nearly indestructible. Her "puzzle pieces" are much smaller and appear to be able to hit with greater force than her previous appearance.

In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new character called the Puzzler under an alias of "Agent Evans" appears as a member of A.R.G.U.S. He is later revealed to be a descendant of Vandal Savage.

Originally, the episodes were going to feature the Riddler (portrayed by Frank Gorshin) and were titled "A Penny for Your Riddles" and "They're Worth a Lot More", but they were reworked due to Gorshin being in the midst of a contract dispute with the series' producers as he no longer wanted to portray the Riddler.
An unidentified incarnation of the Puzzler makes non-speaking cameo appearances in Justice League Unlimited as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society.
