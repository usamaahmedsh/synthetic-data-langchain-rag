No Nukes: The Muse Concerts For a Non-Nuclear Future was a 1979 triple live album that contained selections from the September 1979 Madison Square Garden concerts by the Musicians United for Safe Energy collective. Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Bonnie Raitt, and John Hall were the key organizers of the event and guiding forces behind the album.
This was the first official appearance of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's live act on record, and their "Detroit Medley", a staple of the encores of their regular shows, achieved considerable album-oriented rock airplay.  In 2021, Springsteen officially released a compilation of songs he performed in his sets from the shows as the live album The Legendary 1979 No Nukes Concerts.
Otherwise the album did not get much radio attention, as many of the artists held back their best-known material from appearing on it or emphasized collaborative performances.  The album was certified a gold record by the RIAA in September 1980. It was reissued as a two-CD set by Elektra Records in October 1997.
The No Nukes film was also released in May 1980 from this event, although it contained somewhat varying contents from this album.


== Controversy ==
A controversy sparked after the performance of Jamaican reggae singer Peter Tosh wearing Palestinian clothing (thawb and keffiyeh) and openly smoking marijuana. Tosh's appearance was considered a provocation towards the Jewish community in New York City, as the concerts took place during the Jewish New Year holiday. Despite his performance being advertised to appear in the accompanying film and on the triple live album, Tosh was removed from both releases.
