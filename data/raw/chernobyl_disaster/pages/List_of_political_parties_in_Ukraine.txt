There have been numerous political parties active in Ukraine in the past and present. Currently, as of 1 January 2020, there are 349 officially registered political parties in the country.


== Active ==


=== Parties represented in the Verkhovna Rada ===


==== Official factions ====
Political parties in Ukraine need to hold at least fifteen seats in parliament in order to be recognized as official parliamentary factions.


==== Parliamentary groups ====
In the Verkhovna Rada, parliamentary groups are formed by deputies during a session of parliament. Usually, parliamentary groups are made up of independent deputies or deputies from parties that did not gain enough seats in parliament to form an official faction. Sometimes, they can also be formed through the splintering of official factions. Two parties in the current session of parliament, For the Future and Dovira, were originally formed as parliamentary groups after the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election but later expanded into full-fledged political parties.


==== Parties without faction status ====
Because of the use of first-past-the-post single-mandate electoral districts in Ukrainian parliamentary elections, it is possible for a political party to get fewer than fifteen seats in parliament, meaning that it is not recognized as an official faction. While these deputies were elected as representatives of their respective parties, and continue to be affiliated with their political parties during their time in office, they officially sit as independents. Often, they join parliamentary groups in order to gain more influence over the legislative process (while maintaining their affiliation to their original party).


=== Parties represented in Oblast Councils ===
Ukraine is made up of 24 oblasts, as well as two cities with special status (Kyiv and Sevastopol) and one autonomous republic (the Autonomous Republic of Crimea). All of these entities have oblast Councils (or city councils in the case of Kyiv and Sevastopol), which function as regional legislatures, and are the second level of government after the Verkhovna Rada. In total, there are 1,780 seats across all oblast Councils in Ukraine. These parties have representation on at least one oblast Councils, but no seats in parliament.


=== Parties with local representation ===
These political parties have no seats in parliament or any regional legislature, but do have local representation on city or town councils, mayorships, or other municipal bodies. Many of these parties are local organizations and operate only in a specific city or oblast.


=== Other parties ===
Currently active political parties in Ukraine with no seats in parliament nor in Oblast Councils.

=== Banned parties ===

On 20 March 2022, in the midst of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the suspension of eleven political parties with claimed ties to Russia, which would last until the end of martial law in Ukraine. Two of the suspended political parties, Opposition Platform — For Life and Opposition Bloc, have a significant presence in national politics, while the remaining nine parties are marginal.
In June 2022 various court proceedings tried to ban the parties suspended on 20 March 2022. Of all the  parties suspended on 20 March 2022 only the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine and Opposition Platform — For Life actively opposed its banning. In September 2022 the final appeals against the parties' ban were dismissed by the Supreme Court of Ukraine, meaning that the parties were fully banned in Ukraine.


=== Former parliamentary parties ===

A faction of nonpartisan deputies under the name Reforms for the Future existed between 16 February 2011 and 15 December 2012. A faction of nonpartisan deputies under the name For Peace and Stability existed between 2 July 2014 and 27 November 2014. From 1998 to 2000, there was another parliamentary faction Labour Ukraine that existed without its political party until it was registered by the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice in June 2000.
The Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union) was prohibited in 1991, however its members were not excluded from the Ukrainian parliament. They formed a parliamentary faction of the Socialist Party of Ukraine. For the 1994 parliamentary elections however the ban on communist parties was lifted and there were two parties with similar ideologies running for parliament the Socialist Party of Ukraine and the Communist Party of Ukraine that was reestablished in 1993.

=== Defunct political alliances and blocs (1998–2012) ===
The idea of electoral blocs as a loose association of parties was introduced in 1998, however it did not become popular right away. The real success of electoral blocks came in 2002 when the Bloc of Victor Yushchenko "Our Ukraine" gained the most parliamentary seats. The electoral blocs system was liquidated in 2011 forcing registration of individual parties for the next 2012 parliamentary elections. The longest existing political blocs were Our Ukraine and Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko.
The association of parties however was transformed into a new concept of an "umbrella party" when several parties temporarily unite under such party that becomes a core party of informal electoral bloc. Below is the list of official electoral blocs in 1998 - 2012 that led to creation of their own parliamentary factions.

Bloc of SPU-SelPU (1998–2002)
Our Ukraine (2002–2012; Bloc of Viktor Yushchenko, Our Ukraine-People's Self-Defense Bloc)
For United Ukraine (2002–2006)
Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko (2002–2012)
Bloc of Volodymyr Lytvyn (2007–2012)
