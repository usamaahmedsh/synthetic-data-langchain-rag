The Most is a History Channel television series, hosted and narrated by Mike Rowe, and produced by Weller/Grossman Productions. The show covers many subjects and has a "Most Moment" at the end of every episode. The subjects of the series have to do with the "Most" of something. For example, the most isolated place in space (Mir), the most infamous symbol (swastika), or even the "most" largest island (Greenland). In addition, the stories are arranged into categories such as "close calls".
The Most details the "most" in history — the people, places, and events of the past that had significant impact when they occurred, and how they stood the test of time.
