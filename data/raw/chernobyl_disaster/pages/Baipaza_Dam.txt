The Baipaza Dam (Russian: Байпазинская ГЭС; Tajik: Нерӯгоҳи барқи обии Бойғозӣ) is a concrete face rock-fill dam on the Vakhsh River about 9 km (5.6 mi) southeast of Yovon in Khatlon Province, Tajikistan. A purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power generation and it supports a 600 MW power station.  The first three 150 MW Francis turbine-generators were commissioned in 1985, the fourth in 1986. Its reservoir also holds water for the irrigation of some 40,000 ha (99,000 acres) in the Yovon and Obikiik Valleys to the west. This is accomplished by a 7.3-kilometre-long (4.5 mi) tunnel which runs from the right back of the reservoir and through a mountain to the valley.
