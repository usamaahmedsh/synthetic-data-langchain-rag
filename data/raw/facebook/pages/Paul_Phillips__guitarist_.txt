I won't be airing any dirty laundry in public. That's not who I am. I just want to thank each and every one of you for your support throughout the years at shows and on my facebook page here. It means a lot. I've always tried to make myself accessible to you and have always tried to never let you down when I got up on that stage. However, there is nothing I can do".
