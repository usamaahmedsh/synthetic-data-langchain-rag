== Gameplay ==

A Good Snowman Is Hard to Build is a grid-based puzzle video game that tasks players with helping a featureless monster to build snowmen. Snowmen are built by stacking three snowballs of decreasing size. Rolling small or medium-sized balls over snowy ground increases their size. Building all snowmen in a room unlocks adjacent rooms which are all part of a hedge maze.
Players can undo one move at a time or reset a room.

A Good Snowman Is Hard to Build was created by UK-based independent developers Alan Hazelden and Benjamin Davis. Its prototype was developed using Puzzlescript, an open-source HTML5 puzzle game engine, in 2014. The commercial release was written in Haxe and OpenFL and released for Linux, OS X, and Windows-based personal computers on 25 February 2015. A version for Android and iOS mobile devices was released on 9 December 2015. A Nintendo Switch version released on 2 September 2021.
For the game's 10th anniversary in 2025, the Itch.io release of the game permanently moved to a 'Pay What The Temperature Is' pricing model, where the price would be $1 for every degree Celsius it is in London according to OpenWeatherMap's tracking, updated every hour. For example, if the temperature was 2.5 degrees Celsius, the price would become $2.50. If the temperature in London drops below freezing the game will become freeware.
