Tandem is a mobile language-exchange app for iOS and Android that connects learners with native speakers for one-to-one text, audio and video chats. Founded in 2014 and launched on iOS in 2015 (Android in 2016/2017), the company is based in Berlin. Apple listed Tandem among its "Best Apps of 2015". 


== History ==
Tandem was founded in Hannover in 2014 by Arnd Aschentrup, Tobias Dickmeis, and Matthias Kleimann. Prior to founding Tandem, Aschentrup, Dickmeis and Kleimann had launched Vive, a members-only mobile video chat platform.
In 2020, Tandem discontinued its in-app professional tutoring feature to focus on language exchange.


== Criticism ==
Tandem has received criticism for not accepting members into the community immediately. In some countries, there is a waiting list and applicants can wait up to seven days for their application to be processed by the human moderators.


== Subscription ==
Tandem Pro is an optional subscription with additional tools (e.g., more translations, vocabulary features, ad-free use, and enhanced calling/”Language Parties”).
