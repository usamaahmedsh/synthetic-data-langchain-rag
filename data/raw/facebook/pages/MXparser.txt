mXparser is an open-source mathematical expressions parser/evaluator providing abilities to calculate various expressions at a run time. Expressions definitions are given as plain text, then verified in terms of grammar / syntax, finally calculated. Library source code is maintained separately for Java and C#, providing the same API for Java/JVM, Android, .NET and Mono (Common Language Specification Compliant).


== Main features / usage examples ==
mXparser delivers functionalities such as: basic calculations, implied multiplication, built-in constants and functions, numerical calculus operations, iterated operators, user defined constants, user defined functions, user defined recursion, Unicode mathematical symbols support.


=== Basic operators ===
mXparser supports basic operators, such as: addition '+', subtraction '-', multiplication '*', division '/', factorial '!', power '^', modulo '#'.


=== Implied multiplication ===


=== Binary relations ===
It is possible to combine typical expressions with binary relations (such as: greater than '>', less than '<', equality '=', inequality '<>', greater or equal '>=', lower or equal '<='), as each relation evaluation results in either '1' for true outcome, or '0' for false.


=== Boolean logic ===
Boolean logic also operates assuming equivalence of '1 as true' and '0 as false'. Supported Boolean operators include: AND conjunction, OR disjunction, NAND Sheffer stroke, NOR, XOR Exclusive OR, IMP Implication, CIMP Converse implication, NIMP Material nonimplication, CNIMP Converse nonimplication, EQV Logical biconditional, Negation.


=== Built-in mathematical functions ===
Supported common mathematical functions (unary, binary and variable number of arguments), including: trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, logarithm functions, exponential function, hyperbolic functions, Inverse hyperbolic functions, Bell numbers, Lucas numbers, Stirling numbers, prime-counting function, exponential integral function, logarithmic integral function, offset logarithmic integral, binomial coefficient and others.


=== Built-in math constants ===
Built-in mathematical constants, with high precision.


=== Iterated operators ===
Iterated summation and product operators.


=== Numerical differentiation and integration ===
mXparser delivers implementation of the following calculus operations: differentiation and integration.


=== Prime numbers support ===


=== Unicode mathematical symbols support ===


== Elements defined by user ==
Library provides API for creation of user-defined objects, such as: constants, arguments, functions.


=== User-defined constants ===


=== User-defined arguments ===


=== User-defined functions ===


=== User-defined variadic functions ===


=== User-defined recursion ===
