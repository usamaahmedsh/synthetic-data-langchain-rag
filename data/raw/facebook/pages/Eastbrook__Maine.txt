=== Local Lore ===
Molasses Pond is reputed to be so-named due to a series of canoes that sank to the bottom due to being overfilled with molasses and maple syrup sugar, having been harvested from trees on Sugarhill and being sent down the lake to Scammons and from there through the Macomber Mill Marshes to other lakes towards Hog bay and Frenchmans Bay. Allegedly, it is also reported to be named for either Molly Molasses or another notable native figure. According to the Pond’s Facebook fan page, this and nearby Sugarhill have given rise to the term “the way the sweet life should be”, an homage to Maine’s secondary motto: “the way life should be”.
Nearby Blackswoods and Catherines Hill(Maine) are the site of a local ledges involving paranormal local folklore and urban legends, surrounding the ghost of blackwoods road. 
Cavehill’s eponymous cave-in-a-hill, also is rumoured in stories to be the site of treasure, ghosts, or historic events.
