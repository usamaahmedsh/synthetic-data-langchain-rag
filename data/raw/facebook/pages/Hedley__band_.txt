Hedley was a Canadian pop rock formed in Abbotsford, British Columbia in 2003. They were named after the unincorporated community of Hedley, British Columbia, a name chosen after members heard that it was for sale for $346,000. After lead singer Jacob Hoggard placed third on the second season of Canadian Idol in 2004, the group signed with Universal Music Canada and released their self-titled debut studio album the following year. Hedley had commercial success with their subsequent studio albums, including Famous Last Words (2007), The Show Must Go (2009), Storms (2011), Wild Life (2013),  Hello (2015), and Cageless (2017).
Following the release of Cageless and its accompanying tour, members of Hedley faced accusations of sexual misconduct with young women over the course of their career. After Hoggard faced additional accusations of sexual assault by two women, the group confirmed they would enter an indefinite hiatus.

=== 2003–2006: Early years and debut album ===
Hedley formed in 2003 in Abbotsford, British Columbia and originally consisted of Jacob Hoggard, Kevin Giesbrecht, Kevin Heeres, Ryan Federau, and Brandon McKay. Hoggard participated in Canadian Idol, where he made it to the top three. Shortly after, the members decided to go their separate ways, but the band re-formed not long after, with Hoggard as the only original member. He recruited guitarist Dave Rosin, bassist Tommy Mac, and drummer Chris Crippin, all of whom were previously in the Vancouver band Everything After. Hedley picked up attention at the Canadian Music Week 2005 media showcase and, soon after, signed with Universal Music Canada. "Street Fight" was the first song they wrote together, which was part of their five-track demo they sent to the label.
Their debut single "On My Own" was released on July 18, 2005, as the lead single from their debut self-titled studio album. The song reached number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. "Villain" was released as the second single from the album on July 26, 2005, and peaked at number 18 on the Canada Rock chart.
