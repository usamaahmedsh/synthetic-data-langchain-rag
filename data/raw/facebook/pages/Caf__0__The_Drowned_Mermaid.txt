== Plot ==
The protagonist, who has lost all her memory, finds herself in a strange place called Café 0, where a blue-haired waiter serves her a glass of water. She now relives the last seven days of her life and has the chance to unveil the truth and find the cause of her death. She soon discovers that three people might be connected to her death; Ami, who claims to be her best friend, Shou, the school's doctor, and Tooru, who seems to be her ex-boyfriend. The plot takes different directions based on the player's decisions.


== Development ==
The game was created with Ren'Py. The story and the graphics were created by Chu3, Mirage from Zeiva Inc helped with co-writing, and proofreading was done by Mink and Roxie.

Café 0: The Drowned Mermaid received positive reception on TechnologyTell, where the reviewer gave 93 out of 100 possible points and praised the game's "unique gameplay experience". The game received three out of five stars on Gamezebo, with the reviewer writing: "It’s certainly not the most dynamic piece of literature ever written [...] but if you’re into interactive novels and you’re curious to find out how a mermaid can actually drown, you’ll almost certainly want to play long enough to see the game’s true ending."


== Sequel ==
A sequel, Café 0: The Sleeping Beast, was released on October 29, 2016. It features new characters in a different setting, a theme song, and a longer play time than the first game.
