== Gameplay ==
Players take control of morally ambiguous characters as they slink their way across dark alleys and buildings in an effort to avoid the authorities and other obstacles. The goal of the game is to reorganize a series of comic panels so that the protagonist is not caught by the police. In order to accomplish this feat, players must move frames around so that the sequence allows the main character to sneak past, avoid, or knock out their would-be captors.

As of July 2015, Framed has received over 30 awards and accolades. It has been praised by critics for its "brilliantly simple idea", "pitch perfect" execution, "subtle story telling", "gorgeous visuals", and "finger-snapping music".
In November 2014, Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear series stated that Framed was his Game of the Year. He praised Framed for its "high sense of gameplay, graphic, & sound", adding, "my best game in this year without any doubt".
