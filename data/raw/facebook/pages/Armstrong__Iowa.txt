Armstrong got its start in 1892, after the construction of the railroad through that territory. It was named after Thomas Armstrong, who first arrived in the area near the West Fork Des Moines River to trap. He spent only one winter, as it was too harsh for him. In 1892 the first locomotive arrived in Armstrong and a year later the town of Armstrong was incorporated.
In February 2021, Armstrong's mayor, Gregory Wayne Buum; police chief, Craig Juan Merrill; city clerk, Tracie Lang; and former city clerk Connie Marie Thackery were charged with 21 felony and misdemeanor counts, including fraud, misappropriation of funds, and assault with a dangerous weapon.
