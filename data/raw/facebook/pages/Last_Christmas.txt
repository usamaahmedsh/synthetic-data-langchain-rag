"Last Christmas" is a song credited to the English duo Wham!, written and recorded by its member George Michael. The track was released on 3 December 1984 via CBS Records internationally and as a double A-side via Epic Records with "Everything She Wants" in multiple European countries. Andrew Ridgeley, the other half of Wham!, had no involvement in the recording or writing of the record. Michael wrote the track in February 1984 about a Christmastime breakup. He sang, produced, and performed all of the parts when recording it that August.
"Last Christmas" initially spent five consecutive weeks at number two on the UK singles chart. It was beaten to Christmas number one by the charity single "Do They Know It's Christmas?", on which Michael also performed. Wham! donated their royalties to relief efforts for the Ethiopian famine. 
"Last Christmas" re-entered the chart various times in later years, becoming the highest-selling UK single never to reach number one. It reached number one on New Year's Day 2021, and became the Christmas number one in 2023, 39 years after its release. Combining sales and streams, it also became the third-best selling UK single, with 5.34 million sales, including streams. In 2024, it became the first song to become Christmas number one for consecutive years. "Last Christmas" has also topped the charts in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Sweden.
In the UK, "Last Christmas" was voted eighth on the 2012 ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song and voted the most popular 1980s song in Channel 5's Christmas 2020 countdown Britain's Favourite '80s Songs. It has been covered by artists including Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Whigfield, Crazy Frog and Billie Piper.


== Composition ==
"Last Christmas" describes a Christmastime breakup. The engineer, Chris Porter, said the upbeat rhythm track contrasted against the sadness of unrequited love. The same chord progression and melody is used for both the verse and chorus, with no middle eight.


== Production ==

The Wham! member George Michael wrote "Last Christmas" in his childhood bedroom in February 1984, when he and the other member, Andrew Ridgeley, were visiting his parents. Michael played Ridgeley the introduction and chorus melody, which Ridgeley later called "a moment of wonder".
Wham! recorded "Last Christmas" in August 1984, at Advision Studios, London, with Michael having covered the studio in Christmas decorations "to set the mood". Michael produced the song and wrote and performed every part, using a LinnDrum drum machine, a Roland Juno-60 synthesiser and sleigh bells. Though Michael had no musical training, he performed each part himself, playing the keyboards "with two or three fingers", according to Porter. The only other people in the studio were Porter and two assistants, Paul Gommersal and Richard Moakes.

On release, "Last Christmas" reached number two on the singles chart, beaten by the charity single "Do They Know It's Christmas?" by Band Aid, on which Michael also performed.

== Music video ==
The music video has Michael and Ridgeley accompanying girlfriends at a ski resort, contrasting scenes of a happy Christmas holiday with "wistful memories about past romance". According to Wham!’s manager at the time, Simon Napier-Bell, Michael planned "Last Christmas" as part of a "Christmas package" including the video and a performance at Wembley Stadium. Michael instructed the director, Andrew Morahan, to create a Christmas version of the video for Wham!'s single "Club Tropicana". It was filmed in a ski resort in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, with friends and family members, including the Wham! backing singers Pepsi & Shirlie. Michael's ex-girlfriend was played by the model Kathy Hill.
The music video, originally shot on 35mm film, was re-released on 13 December 2019 in 4K Ultra HD resolution. Morahan had found seven out of the eight rolls of original 35mm rushes and worked with teams at Cinelab London and VFX artist Russ Shaw at Nice Biscuits post production to recreate the video using the higher-resolution film.


== Plagiarism allegations ==
On behalf of the writers of the 1975 song "Can't Smile Without You", made popular by Barry Manilow, the publishing company Dick James Music sued Michael for plagiarism in the mid-1980s, claiming that "Last Christmas" had taken its melody. The case was dismissed when a musicologist presented numerous songs from the past century that had a comparable chord sequence and melody.


== Other media ==
A sixty-minute TV documentary about the story of "Last Christmas" aired on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer in December 2024 to mark the 40th anniversary of its release. It features Ridgeley, Shirlie, Pepsi and other close friends from the original music video, and revisits Saas-Fee in Switzerland where the music video was made, as well as looking into the creation of the song. The film Last Christmas (2019) prominently features the music of George Michael, including this song.

==== Critical reception ====
John Perry from NME named "Last Christmas" by Whigfield Single of the Week, writing, "Gird your loins and don that silly party hat, pop-pickers, because what we have here is the classic Christmas single. [...] The Whigster has taken what was a definitive Christmas song and given it a monster 'I Feel Love' hi-NRG fuel-injection that will have the nation stomping those accursed parsnips into Auntie Mabel's best rug in front of The Queen..." Gill Whyte from Smash Hits gave it two out of five, describing it as "a cover of the George Michael swoon choon for the festive season, given the usual tinny pop Whiggers treatment, with lots of bingy-bongy synths. A classic song, so you can't go wrong, um, only she has, 'cos it just ain't as good as the original."
