== History ==
In 1996, lead singer and guitarist Matt Hammitt met guitarist Chris Rohman when they were both tenth graders attending Toledo Christian School in Ohio. They led youth worship at their school and church, and began writing their own music that year. Drummer Mark Graalman and bassist Matt Kollar soon joined, forming the band's original line-up. The group performed their first concert for several friends in the back of a warehouse in December 1996. They released a six-track demo tape in August 1997, and a five-track EP titled All This Talk of Aliens in January 1998.
Sanctus Real's full-length studio album Message for the Masses was released on June 18, 1999, and shortly afterward, bassist Matt Kollar was replaced by Steve Goodrum. Following Message for the Masses, which was recorded in a garage, the band made plans to record tracks at a major studio.  To earn money for the endeavor, Hammitt and Goodrum took telemarketing jobs for a few months, which were difficult and described by Hammitt as "the most dreadful [jobs] ever". They recorded three songs with producer Skidd Mills in Memphis, Tennessee, and after winning a local radio contest, decided to record an entire independent album with Mills. It was completed in 2000 under the title Nothing to Lose, and the band attended 2001's Gospel Music Week in Nashville to distribute copies of the project.
From 1996 to 2001, Sanctus Real toured areas of the United States, and also sent demos to several Christian and mainstream record labels. After they received multiple recording contract offers in 2001, the band decided to sign with Sparrow Records. Matt Hammitt said, "At that point, we really had to do some soul searching and figure out where it was we were supposed to be ... Ultimately, we knew we could relate to kids in the church. We are passionate about our faith ... [and] from our personal experience, we felt this was the place we were supposed to be."


=== Say It Loud ===
Toward the end of 2002, before releasing their first non-independent album, Sanctus Real performed as an opening act on the Festival Con Dios tour. The band was also a guest on Bleach's first headlining tour, the We Are Tomorrow tour, in December 2002. Sanctus Real's major label debut, Say It Loud, was then released in December 2002, through Sparrow Records. The album was produced by former Grammatrain lead vocalist Pete Stewart. Sanctus Real began touring again in February 2003 as a guest band on the See Spot Rock Tour, with Relient K, the O.C. Supertones, Pillar and John Reuben.


=== Fight the Tide ===

The band recorded a cover of U2's song, "Beautiful Day", for the compilation album In the Name of Love: Artists United for Africa, which was released at the beginning of 2004. The track reached No. 1 on R&R magazine's Christian rock chart in 2004, becoming their first chart-topping single. "Beautiful Day" also received a GMA Dove Award nomination for Modern Rock Song of the Year in 2004. The band also did a cover of the song "Promised Land" for the 2004 album Veggie Rocks.
In February 2004, the band went back in studio to record their second album; almost all of its tracks were written the previous month. It was recorded in six weeks with producer Tedd T, and soon released under the title Fight the Tide in June 2004. The lead single "Everything About You" was released in mid-2004, and by September it had stayed at No. 1 on R&R's Christian rock chart for six consecutive weeks. The song was later featured on the X 2006 compilation album in 2005. In September 2004, Sanctus Real launched their first headlining tour, the Fight the Tide Tour. The tour featured guest bands Hawk Nelson, Seven Places and Ever Stays Red, and traveled through more than 25 cities.
After being nominated in late 2004, Fight the Tide won the GMA Dove Award for "Modern Rock Album of the Year" in early 2005. Released near the beginning of the year, "The Fight Song" was Sanctus Real's next single, and in May 2005 it reached the top of R&R's Christian rock chart, becoming the band's third No. 1 song. In April 2005, bass player Steve Goodrum left the band and was replaced by Dan Gartley, a previous touring member of Relient K.

== Touring ==

Joining them on this 25-city nationwide tour was visionary and speaker David Nasser along with fellow artists Jonny Diaz and MIKESCHAIR. Sanctus Real announced they would be touring with Winter Jam 2012 on the eastern side of the United States.  During their 2012 tour, their tour bus burned to the ground.  Sanctus posted a photo on their Facebook page on June 3, adding all people got off the bus, but their personal belongings were lost. Sanctus Real began The Run Tour in September 2013 and finished in November 2013.


== Musical style ==
Sanctus Real's main genre is typically labeled as Christian rock and alternative CCM. Their first three independent albums were described by Allmusic as power pop. Say It Loud was characterized by increased guitars and a powerful modern rock style. Their second release, Fight the Tide, was described as "melodic power rock" with similarities to Foo Fighters, Jimmy Eat World, Switchfoot, U2, and PFR. The band's music on The Face of Love blended the styles from their previous two albums, evolving into less of a heavier rock sound. With We Need Each Other, lead singer Matt Hammitt noted that he "just pushed the limits of what I can do vocally" during some songs, "whether it be on a soft, kind of rustic sounding vocal or whether it be this overdriven, rock high-range kind of vocal."
