Lagos State (Yoruba: Ìpínlẹ̀ Èkó, Gun: Ayìmátẹ̀n Awọnlìn tọ̀n) is a state in southwestern Nigeria. Of the 36 states, Lagos is the most populous state but has the smallest landmass in Nigeria. Bounded to the south by the Bight of Benin and to the west by the international border with the Republic of Benin, Lagos State borders Ogun State to the north and east, making it the only Nigerian state to border only one other state. Named for the city of Lagos — the most populous city in Africa — the state was formed from the Western Region and the former Federal Capital Territory on 27 May 1967.
Geographically, Lagos State is dominated by bodies of water with nearly a quarter of the state's area being lagoons, creeks, and rivers. The largest of these bodies are the Lagos and Lekki lagoons in the state's interior with the Ogun and Osun rivers flowing into them. Many other rivers and creeks flow throughout the state and serve as vital means of transportation for people and goods. On land, non-urbanized areas are within the tropical Nigerian lowland forests ecoregion with natural areas containing threatened populations of mona monkey, tree pangolin, and hooded vulture along with a transitory population of African forest elephants. Offshore, the state is also biodiverse as there are large fish populations along with African manatees and crocodiles.
Lagos State has been inhabited for years by various indigenous ethnic groups, primarily the majority Yoruba people who live throughout the state but also the Ewe and Ogu peoples in the far west. As a result of migration since the nineteenth century, Lagos State also has large populations of non-native Nigerian ethnic groups with Edo, Efik, Fulani, Hausa, Igbo, Ijaw, Ibibio, and Nupe peoples among other Nigerian groups. There are also groups from outside of Nigeria's modern borders with the Saro (Sierra Leonean) and Amaro (Brazilian) groups being descendants of formerly enslaved people who returned to Africa in the 1800s with a longstanding Middle Eastern Nigerian community (mainly Syrian and Lebanese Nigerians) also forming a significant part of Lagos' population along with recent immigrants from Benin, China, Ghana, India, Togo, and the United Kingdom. Religiously, the state is also diverse, as there is a sizable number of Christian, Muslim and traditional ethnic religions.
In the pre-colonial period, the area that is now Lagos State was mainly fishing villages and ports that at various points were controlled by states including the Benin Empire and Oyo Empire until the early 1800s when the city of Lagos had developed into a major kingdom of its own right. In 1850, the British successfully attacked the kingdom in the Bombardment of Lagos before installing an ally as Oba and signing a treaty that established Lagos as being under British protection. Ten years later, the forced Lagos Treaty of Cession led to the formal establishment of the Lagos Colony. In 1906, the colony was incorporated into the new Southern Nigeria Protectorate which merged into British Nigeria in 1914 with the city of Lagos as its capital. Upon independence in 1960, Lagos remained as the capital with much of the city forming the Federal Capital Territory while the rest of modern-day Lagos State was a part of the Western Region until 1967 when the region was split and the area became Lagos State.
Economically, Lagos State is one of the fastest-growing urban areas in the world. It contains the most populous city in Nigeria and one of the most important states in the country, a major financial centre and has one of the largest economies in Africa with a gross domestic product of $84 billion comparable with Ghana's $75 billion, Angola's $70 billion, and Ethiopia's $93 billion. Lagos State is also a key culture, education, and transportation hub for Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the state also has the highest literacy rate in Nigeria. It is known for its vibrant culture, bustling markets, and significant economic activities. Despite overcrowding and chronic debilitating traffic, Lagos State has the highest Human Development Index in Nigeria and numerous development projects.


== History ==


=== Early history ===
Before the Portuguese name of Lagos had been adopted, Lagos' initial name was Eko which referred mainly to the Island. The first to settle in Eko were the Aworis. Trade later drew various groups to the island, including the Portuguese in the 16th century. The Awori hunters and fishermen had originally come from Ile-Ife to the coast.
It was in 1760 that the name Lagos was adopted by the Portuguese. Naming it after a city in Southern Portugal which was used as port for slave trade.


=== British Involvement ===

In late 1851, the British Royal Navy bombarded Lagos (in present-day Nigeria) in the "Reduction of Lagos." The attack aimed to suppress the Atlantic slave trade, which had thrived in Lagos since the arrival of the Portuguese. The British sought to depose Oba Kosoko, who resisted efforts to end the trade. After Kosoko fled, the British installed Oba Akitoye, a more cooperative ruler aligned with their anti-slavery efforts. In 1861, Oba Docemo was the one who signed the treaty making Lagos a British colony.


=== Colonial Era ===

The Lagos Colony was established in 1861 when the British annexed Lagos, primarily to suppress the transatlantic slave trade and establish a base for expanding British commercial and political influence in West Africa. Strategically located along the Atlantic coast, Lagos quickly became a major center for trade, particularly in palm oil, cocoa, and cotton, which were in high demand in Europe during the Industrial Revolution. Its deep natural harbor made it an essential port for British shipping and trade routes. Economically, Lagos became a gateway for exporting goods and importing British manufactured products, boosting colonial revenues and strengthening British dominance in the region. Politically, Lagos served as the administrative and military base for British expansion into the Nigerian interior, facilitating the broader colonization of Nigeria through treaties, military campaigns, and indirect rule. The infrastructure and institutions established in Lagos during the colonial period laid the foundation for modern Nigeria's economic and political systems.


=== Post-colonial era ===
Lagos State was created on 27 May 1967 according to the State Creation and Transitional Provisions Decree No. 14 of 1967, which restructured Nigeria into a federation of 12 states. Before the issuance of this Decree, Lagos city, which was the country's capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs. However, Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe, Surulere, and Badagry were administered by the then Western Region Government. Lagos, the city, along with these other towns were captured to create the state of Lagos, with the state becoming fully recognized as a semi-autonomous administrative division on 11 April 1968. Lagos served the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976 when the capital of the state was moved to Ikeja. After the full establishment of the Federal Capital Territory, based on the recommendation of the Akinola Àgùdà–led committee set up by General Murtala Muhammed to review the need for a new capital for Nigeria in 1975. The seat of the Federal Government was formally relocated to Abuja on 12 December 1991. Nevertheless, Lagos remains the financial centre of the country, and even grew to become the most populous city in the state and the country.


=== 21st century ===


=== 2002 Lagos armoury explosion ===

The 2002 Ikeja Armoury Explosion occurred on January 27, 2002, when a series of explosions took place at the Ikeja Cantonment in Lagos, Nigeria. The blast, believed to have been caused by the improper storage of explosives and ammunition, led to a massive fire that spread throughout the area. It resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people and displaced thousands more as buildings were destroyed and debris scattered across neighboring communities. The explosion also caused significant damage to properties and triggered widespread panic in Lagos.


=== 2012 Lagos Floods ===

In the 2012 Nigerian floods, Lagos was heavily affected, with large areas submerged, displacing thousands of people, damaging infrastructure, and highlighting the vulnerability of the state to climate-induced disasters. Lagos is a coastal state with a vast lagoon, making it highly susceptible to flooding, especially during heavy rainfall. The city occasionally experiences severe floods, which have worsened due to poor drainage systems and urbanization. Rising sea levels pose a significant threat, with climate change increasing the risk of devastating floods that could wipe out parts of the city.


=== COVID-19 pandemic and End SARS Protests (2020–2021) ===

The first confirmed case in Nigeria was announced on 27 February 2020, when an Italian national in Lagos tested positive for the virus. On 9 March 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro, Ogun State, a Nigerian citizen who came into contact with the Italian national.
The End SARS protest in Lagos State was a nationwide movement in October 2020 aimed at ending police brutality, specifically targeting the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a notorious unit known for its abuse of power. In Lagos, the protests were largely peaceful but escalated on October 20, when the Lekki Toll Gate shooting occurred, where security forces fired on unarmed protester. The incident led to widespread outrage, both locally and internationally. The protests resulted in significant social and political impact, raising awareness about police violence and leading to calls for police reforms. However, the violence and destruction that followed caused extensive damage to businesses, infrastructure, and lives, leaving a lasting scar on the state's economy and social fabric.
