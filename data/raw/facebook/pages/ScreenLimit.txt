ScreenLimit was a time based content-control software for parents to control the time their children spend on devices. 


== Working ==
Children can do assigned tasks like homework to earn more time. Multiple people can use the same or more devices in combination with their own time. They will get a warning when time runs out. When time runs out icons or the desktop will disappear and the ScreenLimit timer page will appear. Multiple schedules can be made like weekend/schoolday/vacation. An example of a schedule could be: Block at 22:00 (regardless of unspent time); Add 60 minutes (a day) at 00:01; UnBlock at 07:00. Parents can see realtime who is using what device. Parents can also manually (un)block a child. With one account multiple children and devices can be managed by multiple parents.
