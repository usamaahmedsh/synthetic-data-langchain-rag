ConnectBot is an open-source Secure Shell client for the Android operating system.  It lets users securely log in remotely to servers that run a secure shell daemon.  This allows the user to enter commands from their Android device and have the commands run on the remote server instead of the local android device. It uses the standard encryption used by SSH2 to keep any commands and data that are transmitted from being eavesdropped by any potential listeners across the network.


== Features ==
It supports login with a username and password to any arbitrary server on the local network or internet
Supports connections based on a public/private keypair instead of username/password for increased security
Allows frequently accessed hosts to be saved in a menu, so that they can quickly be re-connected to
Once the connection has been made with the remote server, the program presents the user with a terminal where input and output can be sent/received just as if the user were sitting in front of a terminal on the actual server.
