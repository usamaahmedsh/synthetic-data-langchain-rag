RelationShipped is an American reality series that premiered on November 9, 2017, on Facebook Watch. The interactive series, produced by BuzzFeed, allows viewers to influence decisions and events in each episode. Facebook users select the show's protagonist, the "Suitor", from eligible single men in the first episode. He hosts female competitors in a Los Angeles–based mansion, where they each vie for his affection. In subsequent episodes, the audience has the ability to nominate new prospective competitors to be introduced, and the opportunity to select date ideas, amongst other decisions. New episodes are released twice weekly, on Monday and Thursday.


== Production ==
Episodes of the series air only days after they are filmed. This provides the show's Producers, with the ability to shape the narrative of the show as the audience would like to see it. BuzzFeed Motion Pictures', head of development Matthew Henick, has described the show saying, "We wanted to build a format that television audiences are familiar with, a dating format, but from the ground up for digital. Shooting and releasing it in real time allows the audience to affect the show and get involved in ways they couldn't before."

== Reception ==
The series has received a mixed to negative reception since its premiere. The Guardian's Jake Nevins criticized the show when saying, "It’ll all appear a bit ham-fisted to fans of The Bachelor and its chintzy elegance; worse, for those who buy into prevailing millennial stereotypes, it’ll be nothing short of unwatchable, a confirmation that we’re as self-involved and phone-obsessed as the world believes us to be."
