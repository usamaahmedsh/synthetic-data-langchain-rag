AudioBoom PLC is an on-demand audio and podcasting distribution platform. AudioBoom offers business-to-business services to the radio, media and podcast industries.
AudioBoom's platform has been used to power on-demand audio for businesses including BBC, The Spectator Associated Press, NBC Sports, Yahoo!, Cumulus Media and Westwood One.
The company is based in London with offices in New York. It became AIM-listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2014 as Audioboom Group Limited (AIM: BOOM).


== History ==
The company was founded in 2009 by Mark Rock, a former co-founder of PlayJam, as Audioboom Limited, with funding from 4iP, Channel 4's technology innovation fund. The original name was Audioboo.fm.
The initial product was a "social sound sharing platform", a free iPhone app and a website that allowed users to share audio clips up to five minutes long. Early high-profile users included Stephen Fry, Chris Moyles, the British Library and The Guardian. The latter used it to cover the 2009 G20 London summit protests. The platform was also used to share audio during the Arab Spring.
In October 2012, Rob Proctor replaced Rock as CEO, and Rock left the company on 1 May 2013. Proctor refocused the business on providing content from professional broadcasters, and Audioboo was renamed audioBoom.
The main shareholders were UBC Media Group and Slovar Limited. In 2014 they sold their shares in a reverse takeover to the listed company One Delta plc., changing the name of the latter to Audioboom Group plc (AIM symbol BOOM).
The AudioBoom mobile app was discontinued in May 2019.
