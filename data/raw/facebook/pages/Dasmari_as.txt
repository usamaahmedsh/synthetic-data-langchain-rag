Dasmariñas (Tagalog: [dɐsmaˈɾiɲɐs]), officially the City of Dasmariñas (Filipino: Lungsod ng Dasmariñas), is a  component city in the province of Cavite, Philippines. According to the 2024 census, it has a population of 744,511 people. With a land area of 90.1 square kilometers (34.8 sq mi) , it is the largest city both in terms of area and population in Cavite and the wealthiest local government unit in the province.
Being located just 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) from Imus and 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Manila, the growing congestion and conurbation of the Manila Metropolitan area has led to its rapid development in the late 1900s. This growth is manifested by the influx of major shopping malls, hospitals, universities, banks, industrial parks, and the growing number of residential subdivisions accommodating its growing population.


== Etymology ==
Dasmariñas was named after Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, the 7th Spanish governor-general of the Philippines who served from 1590 to 1593. After his death, his son Luis Pérez Dasmariñas became the governor-general from 1593 to 1596. Pérez Dasmariñas came from San Miguel das Negradas of Viveiro, in Galicia, Spain.
Dasmariñas literally means "from As Mariñas" (coastal region of Lugo combining the comarcas of A Mariña Occidental, A Mariña Central and A Mariña Oriental), coming itself from mariño ("of the coast, seaside or shore" in the Galician language, the native tongue from Viveiro Galicia, Spain), and this from mar ("sea").


== History ==


=== Foundation and Spanish Ruling ===
In the 19th century, during the Spanish colonial period, Dasmariñas was originally called Tampus, meaning "end of the forest" in the local Tagalog language. It was formerly a barrio of Imus and part of a vast Recollect hacienda that supported the various missionary activities of the Recollects in the Philippines and Spain.
On April 9, 1864, a council composed of the Archbishop of Manila, the politico-military governor of Cavite, the Prior Provincial of the Augustinian Recollect Order, and the parish priest of Imus met to discuss the creation of a new town and parish to separate from Imus. At that time, there were only 643 inhabitants in Tampus. After thorough discussions, Rafaél de Echagüe, the Governor-General of the Philippines, approved the creation of the new town on May 12, 1864, with Don Juan Ramirez elected as the first town head, or gobernadorcillo.
The creation of the town was unique among other towns in Cavite. For the first time, a town was established not through a petition from the local populace and its officials, as was customary and legally required, but instead through the initiative of high-ranking church officials and the Cavite politico-military governor.
An ensemble of nipa houses from other barrios of the hacienda, such as Malinta, Nancaan, Salacay, Paliparan, Malagasang, and Salitran, was grouped and migrated into a reducción (reduction) in Tampus in 1866. Reducción originally referred to the religious and civic aspects of missionary activities but later came to mean the process of resettling and unifying a community, thus creating a newly organized town. For the Spanish missionaries and friars, this process was advantageous for evangelization and consolidating Spanish rule. The new town could be accessed through a well-constructed network of roads and bridges built by the Recollect Order's architects and engineers.
In the same year, it was renamed Perez-Dasmariñas in honor of the seventh Governor-General of the Philippines, Don Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas (1590–1593). Governor Dasmariñas, a Knight of Santiago, was a native of Galicia, Spain and a former magistrate of Murcia and Cartagena, Spain, who introduced significant economic improvements during the early days of colonization.
By the end of 1866, Perez-Dasmariñas had met the requirements of a typical Philippine town. A spacious town plaza at the center was surrounded by a church and a convent made of stone and bricks, a courthouse constructed from wood and nipa, a primary school for children, and various houses made of nipa. A cemetery was situated approximately 200 yards away from the church and enclosed by a wooden fence.
Due to the growing population, the Recollects sent a petition to Madrid for the establishment of a new parish in Dasmariñas, independent from Imus. Queen Isabella II signed the Royal Order creating the new parish of Perez-Dasmariñas on October 21, 1866. The following year, the construction of the stone parish church of Dasmariñas, dedicated to the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, began.


=== The First Barangays ===
Dasmariñas was originally composed of several barangays or barrios (neighborhoods). Among these, Salitran was considered the most important and notable during the Spanish regime due to its role as the site of the Recollect estate house. The name Salitran is derived from the Tagalog word sal-it, meaning "people from another town." Being part of the Recollect Hacienda in the town of Imus, Salitran attracted many workers from various provinces who labored as farmhands. Within Salitran, a place called Layong Iloko was named for the Ilocanos who settled there, while Pasong Santol earned its name from the abundance of santol trees in the area.
Tampus, the center of the newly established town, was situated at the edge of a deep forest. This contrasts with a sitio in Paliparan called Pintong Gubat, which translates to "gate of the forest." Barangay names were often inspired by geographical features, as seen in Barrio Burol, whose name reflects its elevated location. Similarly, Sabang means "crossroads." Barrio Salawag is believed to have been the old Barrio Salacay, with salawag referring to long bamboo poles used for securing nipa roofing.
Nancaan, now known as Langkaan, derived its name from the Tagalog word langka, meaning "jackfruit." The jackfruit, the largest fruit tree in the Philippines, was reportedly introduced from India to Malaysia and later planted in the country by Arabs and Indians. The prevalence of jackfruit trees in the area likely inspired the name Nancaan.
Malinta, or Malintaan, comes from the Tagalog word linta, meaning "leech," due to the abundance of leeches in the area.
On July 18, 1899, three sitios in Perez-Dasmariñas were elevated to the status of barrios: Sampaloc, named for the abundance of tamarind trees; Tamban, later renamed San Jose; and Lucsuhin, later renamed San Agustin.


=== The Philippine Revolution ===
By June 1896, the Spanish authorities in Cavite province had become suspicious of the local elite's activities. There were alleged top hierarchy meetings of the Recollects in the hacienda houses of Salitran and San Nicolas. Included in the meeting were General Bernardo Echaluce and other top military officials. The purpose of the meeting was to determine whether it was just to apprehend the notable elites who were Freemasons. Fortunately for the elites, no decision was made during the meeting. Thus, the local leaders freely but quietly continued their subversive activities.
As soon as the revolution of 1896 broke out, leaders of Perez-Dasmariñas took up arms against the Spanish rule. Don Placido Campos, the town head at the time and Don Francisco Barzaga, the municipal secretary, gathered the people to liberate their town from Spanish control at the beginning of September 1896. They captured the courthouse and the hacienda house in Salitran, killing the religious clergy who lived there.
As towns in Cavite fell to Filipino revolutionaries, the Spanish government in Madrid felt that Governor-General Ramon Blanco's offensive against the natives was ineffective. Thus, Camilo de Polavieja took over the command of the islands, with General José de Lachambre as the head of the campaign. Gradually, the Spaniards regained the control of the province. After the fall of Silang, the Spaniards focused on Perez-Dasmariñas. Knowing the strength of resistance he might encounter, General Lechambre decided to surround the whole town. He sent to advance units headed by Brigadier General José Molina who went to take the left. The troop under Colonel Arutos who had taken Paliparan, moved westward to cut the escape of the Filipinos to Imus and Carmona. General Lechambre sent the main force towards the south.
The locals suffered a terrible defeat due to a lack of arms and ammunition. As the Spaniards approached the Poblacion, the revolutionaries retreated to the stone building of the town. On February 25, 1897, the Spaniards decided to encircle the Poblacion rather than advance directly into the interior. They began burning all the buildings except the church. Seeing that they were surrounded by fire, some of the rebels came out of hiding but were immediately met with open fire. Those who had taken refuge in the courthouse refused to come out and were all burned alive. Even those who had sought refuge in the church eventually surrendered to the advancing Spanish forces. By March, Perez-Dasmariñas had fallen back into Spanish hands.
Then, General Lachambre returned to Salitran. He expected heavy resistance from the revolutionaries who occupied the hacienda house but to his great surprise, they were able to take the place without any resistance. They hoisted the flag of Spain and converted it to their headquarters.
There were large Filipino casualties according to Lachambre. There were 150 men inside the courthouse when Spaniards set fire to the building and all 150 inside were killed. Others took refuge in the convent, but was also set on fire and the men were shot as they emerged. Others had shut themselves up in the church. With the church surrounded, the mountain artillery was brought up into position and from a distance of 35 meters, the strong doors of the church were bombarded and the troops went in through the breach. At the height of the Battle of Perez Dasmariñas, General Flaviano Yengko, General Crispulo Aguinaldo, Lucas Camerino, Arturo Reyes and many more revolutionaries lost their lives in the battle.


=== An American Plan ===
With the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898, the Philippines was ceded to America by Spain. The American regime brought to Dasmariñas, as it did to other parts of the country, several fundamental changes in the system of government, in language, and in educational system.
In the month of February 1899, the Philippine–American War began. General Henry Ware Lawton's brigade operated south of Manila including the province of Cavite in the middle of June 1899. The Americans could not land directly at Bacoor because Zapote river was defended by the Filipino revolutionists who built trenches as tactical defenses forming three sides of an angle which made the Filipinos hardly visible. The American's 14th Infantry Battalion swam across the during the Battle of Zapote River and under the cover of military artillery, charged against the Filipinos who then retreated to the woods.
Moving southward, the Americans encountered more Filipino revolutionaries in the towns of Bacoor, Imus, and Perez-Dasmariñas, and an infantry battalion narrowly escaped annihilation. News had been brought to the American camp that the Filipino soldiers had evacuated the town and that the native mayor was disposed to surrender it formally to the Americans. The battalion thus went there to take possession, but before reaching the place, the Filipino revolutionists closed in on all sides, and a heavy firefight went on for hours. The Americans were saved from destruction by a desperate bayonet charge when they were rescued by General Weaton's brigade.
Placido Campos, who sided with General Emilio Aguinaldo since the beginning of the Philippine-American War in 1899, was captured together with his nephew Guillermo Campos. They were imprisoned at the Provost Political Prison in Intramuros where they were kept for six months.
The Americans established military rule in 1900. By order of the colonel of the American troops stationed in Perez-Dasmariñas, the residents of the town nominated a president and a vice-president. Elected through the raising of hands were Francisco Barzaga as president and Conrado Malihan as vice-president. They served their office until the civil government was established by the Americans in 1901.
On January 31, 1901, in accordance with President William McKinley's instructions that the Filipinos be allowed to manage their own municipal governments, the Second Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 82, the new Municipal Code, placing each municipal government under the following officials: the municipal president, the vice-president, and the municipal council, who were elected by qualified voters every two years. In line with this, Placido Campos was again elected as the head of the municipality of Perez-Dasmariñas in October 1901. Francisco Barzaga then became the municipal treasurer. The two were re-elected in 1903.
In 1903, the Americans conducted the first census in the Philippines. Francisco Barzaga and the secretary, Esteban Quique, were made census enumerators for Perez-Dasmariñas under the leadership of Placido Campos. When the census was finished, the total population of the town was only 3,500. Before the revolution of 1898, the population was estimated to be 12,000. Comparing the population prior to the revolution with that of 1948, there has been a decrease in the population of Perez-Dasmariñas.
On October 15, 1903, the municipalities of Bacoor and Perez-Dasmariñas were merged with Imus.
In 1917, under Governor-General Francis Burton Harrison, Perez-Dasmariñas was again declared a separate municipality. The provincial governor of Cavite, Antero S. Soriano, convened the local leaders, including Placido Campos, Francisco Barzaga, and Felipe Tirona. Together, they agreed to remove the word "Perez" and retain only "Dasmariñas" as the new name of the town. For the second time, Placido Campos was appointed mayor.
Development slowly came in the 1930s when the Aguinaldo Highway was constructed.


=== World War II ===
During the Japanese occupation in World War II, the Japanese conducted zonifications in the town. The barrios of Paliparan and Salawag suffered the most number of deaths. Being remote places and thinking that guerrillas were hiding there, these two barrios were zonified two times giving up several lives. The Japanese Imperial Army made the schools as their garrison.
Meanwhile, after surviving in the Bataan Death March and released from Camp O'Donnell concentration camp in Capas, Tarlac, General Mariano Castañeda returned to Cavite and helped organized the resistance movement in Dasmariñas headed by Colonel Estanislao Mangubat-Carungcong of the 4th Infantry Regiment of Camp Neneng Dasmariñas and Colonel Emiliano de la Cruz of the 14th Infantry Regiment of Camp Paliparan. This unit provided guerilla warfare and was prepared to attack, sabotage missions, cut off enemy communications and logistics, perform recoinnaissance missions, provide protection to civilians against aggression by the Imperial Japanese Army, provide evacuation plans for them, and intensify intelligence reports to the U.S. 11th Airborne Division headed by General  Joseph Swing and 187th Glider Infantry Regiment under Colonel Harry B. Hildebrand .
In May 1943, The Imperial Japanese Army have received intelligence reports of the guerilla camp of the 4th Infantry Regiment in the west side of the town. They then positioned two long range cannons and fired 30 rounds, damaging rice plantations and crops, killing a large amount of cattle, and terrorized the Poblacion. Nevertheless, vigilant about the situation, the guerillas have narrowly escaped complete annihilation. After the assault, the town became too hot to the Japanese because of the active guerilla operations and the existence of the headquarters of the guerillas in Neneng Dasmariñas.
As the Sakdalistas and Makapili (Japanese collaborators) denouncing and reporting all guerilla activities of Colonel Estanislao M. Carungcong to the notorious Kempeitai, the Japanese military police, in exchange for payments and privileges, because of it the Kempeitai made another zonification on July 25, 1943, in the town proper until guerilla regimental staff Lt. Colonel Jose M. Carungcong, Major Dominador I. Mangubat, Captain Elpidio Mangubat-Barzaga Sr., and Captain Jovito Evangelista were captured and imprisoned for two months in a prison camp in Muntinlupa until they were released, except for Lt. Colonel Jose M. Carungcong, who was sentenced to six years in prison.
On June 24, 1944, the Hunters ROTC guerillas headed by Colonel Emmanuel de Ocampo, Lieutenant Colonel Vic Estacio, and Colonel Eleuterio Terry Adevoso raided the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa and rescued many prisoners of war and a good haul of firearms and ammunition. Among the prisoners rescued was Lt. Colonel Jose Carungcong, who managed a jailbreak during the raids of the prison camp. Thereafter, the Japanese Military authorities immediately issued a 50,000 peso reward in exchange for his capture.
On August 25, 1944, with the help of the guerilla soldiers of the 4th Infantry Regiment, 114 Filipino military prisoners, 4 American senior officers, Volckmann's guerilla, and 70 more prisoners of war made a jailbreak at the prison camp in Muntinlupa. They were in poor health condition, deprived of proper meals, and were too skinny. They were kept in Camp Neneng Dasmariñas and given aid and sustenance and were treated by Major Dominador I. Mangubat, who was also a medical doctor, for two months until they recovered from malnutrition.
On December 17, 1944, from 0100 hours until 1800 hours, around 1,000 Kempeitai from Fort Santiago conducted another zonification in the poblacion and adjacent barrios. The Immaculate Conception Parish Church was used as their garrison and all suspected male residents involved or coordinating with the guerrilla operations of Colonel Estanislao M. Carungcong, with the advice of the Makapili collaborators, 15 active guerilleros of the Cobra unit 4th Infantry Regiment were tortured inside the church and some others that were brought to the back of the Dasmariñas Elementary School were tortured and bayonetted to death. Some were hanged at the old mango tree near the school canteen, whipped, beaten, tortured to forcefully expose and divulge the guerillas. Women were abducted and raped by the Japanese soldier. There were those who experienced the so-called "tinutubig" wherein the head is immersed in a drum of water.
On January 15, 1945, the day before the FACGF General Castañeda - US 11th Airborne Major Jay Vanderpool conference in Camp Neneng Dasmariñas, local guerrillas ambushed nine Japanese soldiers inside a jitney in Anabu Road in Salitran. The next day, on January 16, Japanese soldiers retaliated by firing indiscriminately on the civilian population.
On January 30, 1945, as Allied forces began to land in Nasugbu, Batangas, the guerilla force of the 4th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Estanislao Mangubat Carungcong, a battalion under Major Zacarias Santiaguel of the 1st Infantry Regiment protected the National Highway 17 (Aguinaldo Highway) and attacked enemy positions at the national Highway 17 from Palapala Road extending 3000 yards east and west of the National Highway 17 up to Salitran Road. The 14th Infantry Regiment headed by Colonel Emiliano de la Cruz protected the highway between Dasmariñas and Carmona to prevent the enemy to rally a counterattack and to clear the path of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division under General 
Joseph Swing which were being dropped via parachute in Tagaytay. Japanese military vehicles approaching from the north, east, and south sides of the town were ambushed.
FACGF Division Commander General Mariano Castañeda issued the command to liberate Dasmariñas to Colonel Estanislao Mangubat-Carungcong. The combined contingent of the FACGF's 4th Regiment, together with Colonel Lorenzo Saulog's 1st Infantry Regiment and Colonel Maximo Reyes' 11th Infantry Regiment killed 56 Japanese soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army garrisoned in Dasmarinas and the nearby town of Imus leading to the total liberation of Dasmariñas.


=== Post-War ===
After the war, the Philippines became independent and Dasmariñas started to develop. The population increased because of the mass exodus of families from Metro Manila and nearby provinces.
The Dasmariñas Bagong Bayan (DBB), also known as Dasmariñas Resettlement Area, was established in 1975 by Letter of Instruction No. 19 issued by the then President Ferdinand Marcos.
From 1983 onwards Dasmariñas had an economic boom. Different factories and establishments sprouted in the town which gave way for the growth in population. From a sixth-class municipality, the town became a first-class municipality.


=== Cityhood ===

There have been several attempts to convert Dasmariñas into a city. The first attempt was in 1997, when HB08931 was filed by Congressman Renato P. Dragon with other cityhood bills of Imus (HB 08960) and Bacoor (HB 08959). It was filed last February 11, 1997, and read last February 13, 1997. Committee Report N0. 01361 was submitted on December 17, 1997. It was approved on the third reading by the House last January 10, 1998. It did not push through as a Republic Act and no plebiscite happened.
The second attempt was in 2000, when HB099883 was filed by Congressman Erineo Maliksi last March 13, 2000. It was first read last March 13, 2000. It was approved on the Second and Third reading of House last March 15, 2000, and March 27, 2000. It was transmitted to the senate on March 28, 2000, and received on March 31, 2009. It did not push through as a Republic Act and no plebiscite happened.
The idea of converting Dasmariñas into a component city was again proposed for the third time after failure in 1997 and 2000. House Bill no. 5258 converting the municipality of Dasmariñas into a component city was filed by Cavite 2nd District Congressman Elpidio F. Barzaga Jr. on October 3, 2008. It was later signed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as Republic Act No. 9723 on October 15, 2009.
COMELEC Resolution No. 8682 in connection with the November 25, 2009, plebiscite to ratify the conversion of the municipality of Dasmariñas province of Cavite into a component city pursuant to Republic Act 9723 dated October 15, 2009.
Republic Act No. 9723 was ratified by the registered voters of Dasmariñas through a plebiscite conducted last November 25, 2009, converted the municipality of Dasmariñas in the province of Cavite into a component city to be known as the City of Dasmariñas. There were about 44,000 voters who cast the plebiscite ballot in the town's 1,508 polling precincts. The yes votes won overwhelmingly. The yes votes got 36,559 while the no votes got 8,141.
Mayor Jennifer Austria-Barzaga, elected in 2007, is both the first female mayor and first city mayor of Dasmariñas since its achieving city status.
In 2011, the Paro-Paro Festival was first celebrated. It is celebrated every November 26 to commemorate the incorporation of the city of Dasmariñas with people dancing and parading in the streets in butterfly costumes. In November 2013, the Paru-Paro Festival was cancelled as allocated funds would be donated to the Typhoon Yolanda victims.
As of the 2020 census, the city recorded a population of more than 700,000. The city serves as a catalyst for major economic development and sustained growth for the Greater Manila Area since the 1990s. The influx of industries, educational and health institutions, shopping malls, and real estate developments is significant.


== Geography ==

Dasmariñas is about 8,234 hectares (20,350 acres). It is bounded by Imus and Bacoor to the north, Silang to the south, Muntinlupa and Las Piñas in  Metro Manila to the northeast, General Mariano Alvarez, San Pedro in Laguna to the east, and General Trias to the west.
The city center, or the poblacion, is on the westernmost part of the city, Sabang, San Jose, Salawag and Salitran are in the north, San Agustin, Langkaan, and Sampaloc are in the south, Paliparan is on the easternmost part, while Burol and Bagong Bayan are in the middle, sandwiched between the Poblacion and Paliparan.
The city of Dasmariñas is landlocked. However, it is not too far from the coastal towns of Rosario, Kawit, Bacoor, Noveleta and Cavite City whose average distance from Poblacion is less than 30 kilometers (19 mi). It is about the same distance from Laguna de Bay and 29 kilometres (18 mi) from the resort city of Tagaytay and the famous Taal Lake.
At present, Dasmariñas is served by corridors traversing the central areas which provide linkages to the Metropolitan Manila area core in the north and the developing nodes of Laguna and Batangas.


=== Topography ===
Dasmariñas is partly lowland and partly hilly. The Poblacion itself is elevated. From an elevation of 80 meters (260 ft) at the Poblacion, the land rises to 250 meters (820 ft) towards Silang. Generally, land near rivers and creeks are rugged. Dasmariñas is outside the typhoon belt and has no fault line constraints. Further, it is served by natural drainage system since it is traversed by several rivers and water tributaries draining to the Manila Bay. The city has not yet to experience floods.
Strongly sloping to elevated areas cover approximately 1,532.16 hectares (3,786.0 acres) or 18.61% of the total area.  These are dispersed among Burol, Langkaan, Paliparan, Salawag, Sampaloc and San Agustin. Areas with slopes 10.1 to 18% cover about 575.72 hectares (1,422.6 acres) of land in portions of Salawag, Salitran, Burol, and other parts.
On the other hand, gently sloping or undulating areas comprise merely 710.4 hectares (1,755 acres) or 8.62% of the total land area while undulating areas with a slope of 2.6 to 5% account for the biggest percentage of 50.59% of the total land area equivalent to 4,165.64 hectares (10,293.5 acres) of land which are dispersed over the municipality except Sabang and San Jose.


=== Climate ===
Dasmariñas has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification: Aw) with two pronounced seasons: wet season and dry season. Wet season covers the period from May to December of each year and dry season covers the period from January to April.


== Demographics ==

In the 2020 census, the population of Dasmariñas, was 703,141 people, with a density of 7,800 inhabitants per square kilometer or 20,000 inhabitants per square mile.
From the original 643 inhabitants of the old Perez-Dasmariñas, the population grew and so did the town. By 1888, there were already more than 4,576 people living in Perez Dasmariñas. Gradually, the economic life of the people improved. The inquilinos (lessees) of the hacienda rose to become the middle class. Dasmariñas, 8,664 hectares were all farmed in 1890 except for 3,770 hectares (including parcels at Gatdula and Balimbing). Lessees paid the usual land rent base on the measurement of lowland and upland riceland set up by the "uldog" (friar administrator) of casa hacienda de Salitran. In the 1880s, there were 200 quinones of dry and 50 quinones of wet ricelands yielding some 2,300 cavanas of palay, 5,000 piculs of mucavado sugar, 50 cavans of corn and camote, 60 piculs of tao and 25 piculs of peanuts.
Dasmariñas was a highly advanced town where not only textiles from Batangas and Bulacan looms, but also imported European cloth from Manila reached the town elites. Fish and other staple food however still came from nearby towns. Surprisingly until 1880, there was no public market in the town. There was a principal public dirt road in Perez-Dasmariñas that went to Silang which was passable to all kinds of vehicle only during dry season, but reachable only by foot and horseback during wet season. By 1870, mails from Manila were received at a central station in Cavite Puerto where it was sorted. Mails were brought via Kawit, then Imus then Dasmariñas.
Culturally, Perez-Dasmariñas was not too behind for by 1874 there were already two competing brass bands in the town. Don Valeriano Campos, an inquilino and a former gobernadorcillo of the town (1879 to 1881) organized one of the brass bands. He was popularly known as Capitang Vale. He was the highest taxpayer and owned a house made of cogon and wood on Calle Real with an appraised value of P300. His son Placido Campos learned his trade and also considered a man of means. Manuela Monzon, another well to do woman owned a house at the town's main street. The house made of nipa and wood was valued at P200 and was rented as a boys' school for P72.
Nonetheless, in 1892, there was a noticeable decrease of the male population. As conflict between the friar-hacenderos, the inquilinos and casamas multiplied more people went into hiding in the deep forest of Perez-Dasmariñas. The rise of tulisanismo in Cavite was often connected with agrarian problems in the hacienda town owned by the friars.
The city has 75 barangays, has more than 180 subdivisions and the biggest resettlement area in the Philippines, the Dasmariñas Bagong Bayan (DBB).

Most affluent families from Metro Manila and nearby towns and provinces have chosen Dasmariñas to be their home due to its proximity to the National Capital Region. The mass exodus of people here in Dasmariñas is also brought about by the industrial boom which brought about more jobs. There are also a big number of foreign residents such as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Americans, Hindus, Britons and Eurasians. Because of this, Dasmariñas can be also considered as the "Melting Pot" of Cavite.


=== Religion ===

Christianity is the predominant faith, composed of Roman Catholics, Protestants, and other independent Christian groups.
Majority of the population are Roman Catholics. The city is the seat of the Vicariates of Immaculate Conception and Our Mother of Perpetual Help under the jurisdiction of Diocese of Imus.
Other prominent religious groups include Church of God World Missions, Philippines and the local Church of God Dasmariñas, serve as the National Office of the Church of God based in Cleveland, Tennessee. Jesus Miracle Crusade International Ministry (Dasma Outstation, Iglesia ni Cristo, United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP), Day by Day Christian Ministries, Jesus Is Lord Church (JIL), Evangelica Unida De Cristo, Victory Christian Fellowship, United Pentecostal Church (Phils), Inc., World Mission Church, The United Methodist Church, Herald of Grace Covenant Bible Church of Cavite, Presbyterian Churches, Baptist and Bible Fundamental churches, Seventh Day Adventist Churches, Members Church of God International known as Ang Dating Daan, The Lord's Hand Family Apostolic Church, and The Jesus People (TJP), also known as Jesusites.
A considerable percentage of the population is also composed of Muslims. This city has the largest number of Balik Islam 'reverts to Islam' community in the Philippines.
Religious tolerance exists among members of different sects.


=== Languages ===
The city has a majority of English and Tagalog speakers. Almost all households in the city are bilingual and know how to speak English. Due to its proximity to Metro Manila and being part of the Greater Manila Area, there is also a considerably minor number of speakers of Bicolano, Ilocano, Ilonggo, Cebuano, Pangasinan, Kapampangan and Chavacano.


== Cityscape ==


=== Barangays ===

The City of Dasmariñas is divided into 11 unofficially defined administrative districts and is subdivided into 75 barangays, as described in detail below. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.


==== Poblacion ====

The Poblacion is the city center which is home to Dasmariñas' old residents. The newly renovated old church of the Parish of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, Dasmariñas Library, Dasmariñas Elementary School and the Immaculate Conception Academy-Science High School are located in the town's plaza. Municipal Government's municipio or the town hall is located a few meters away from the plaza. Near the Poblacion is the De La Salle University-Health Sciences Campus and the DLSU-Medical Center, the 1st ISO Certified Hospital in the Philippines.
Divided into four zones, the city center is mostly residential area but is still lined with many business establishments. Celebrations, shows and gatherings are being held at the plaza. Every December 8, the town's Poblacion celebrates the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception wherein colorful banderitas, loud marching bands and expectacular display of fireworks are seen and is being visited by many people coming from the different towns in Cavite. Cultural shows and many celebrations are happening here almost weekly so it has the rightful claim to be called "The Liveliest City in Cavite".
Most of institutional, commercial and thrift banks of the city are also found in this area. Many schools are also established here in Poblacion.
Five barangays are located in this district.

Zone I
Zone I-A (A stands for Aguinaldo because of its location along Aguinaldo Highway)
Zone II
Zone III
Zone IV


==== San Agustin ====
Kasuyan is its first name of this place, during the Spanish period, because of the presence of many cashew trees on the area. After many years, its name became Luksuhin and on July 18, 1889, it was renamed again by the petition passed by Don Juan Bautista requesting the place be named after San Agustin. The place is lying between the Poblacion and Sampaloc in the north. Here, vast lands with big mango trees can be found.

==== San Jose ====
This barangay is situated between the Poblacion and Sabang. On April 13, 1889, a petition was passed appealing the sitio, once known Sitio Tamban, to be transformed into a barangay. The place was renamed on July 18, 1889, and was given the name San Jose in commemoration of their patron saint, St. Joseph. Cumpuerta is the name of the hide-out of the Filipino revolucionarios during the revolution against Spain. This is a deep canal of flowing water which still exists until now. The families of Cantada, Villena, Reyes, Mendoza, Camañag, Ramos, and Pastor are the first ones who settled here.
Today there's a lot of subdivisions and Schools situated in this area.
Only one barangay is located in this district, its namesake, Barangay San Jose.


==== Salitran ====
This place is known for the name "Salitran" even during the Spanish period. There are no exact historical accounts for the origin of the name. Some says that such name was given because the early settlers of this place were from Pampanga, Visayas, Tagalog region and some Chinese that served the Spanish friars. However, according to the original settlers here, the place was originally called "Bayanan". They said that this has numerous big Spanish houses which is like in a small town. An old house in the eastern part of Salitran was used by the Spanish friars as the storage place for the rice and was called "Makina". It was also used as a headquarters by the Guardia Civil. When the revolution ignited, the "Makina" became the center of attack by the revolucionarios from the Poblacion and this barrio. The friars weren't aware of the said assault. On March 7, 1897, the Spanish went to Salitran where the Magdalo soldiers led by Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo hid. General Emilio Aguinaldo received help from one thousand men and formed a greater force and even the Spanish troops led by General Lechambre didn't penetrate Salitran. Because of the rebelry, the Spanish burned all the houses and establishments in the barrio. There were only left three houses unburned. During the World War II, Simplicio Lara and Teodorico Timbang were killed by the Japanese soldiers.
Now, Salitran is on vast development due to the presence of numerous subdivisions and villages. Schools located here are  West Hill Academy, Colegio De Salitran, St. Jude College, The Immaculate Conception Academy-North Campus, and many others.

==== Sabang ====
On the northern part of Dasmariñas is where this barangay can be traveled and found. The word "Sabang" means "to overflow", wherein the creeks running from Malagasang, Imus tend to inundate in this place. This were made by the Spanish friars to irrigate the vast rice fields of the barangay. The diversion in the direction of the water flow had vastly made changes in the agriculture during the Spanish period, for there was a rich production of rice corps. Because of this, a bodega was made here for the storage of rice and was called the "Kamalig ng Pare" (Silo of the Priest). This place is considered to be the richest land in Dasmariñas. Residents here were known to be industrious. Agriculture is still a source of income in this barangay, though it has diminished due to the development of its agrarian lands into subdivisions and schools for children. More than 85% of the population are professionals and have a high standard of living. In this place, the Madona Charity Clinic is located, owned by Mrs. Bracia Tengko. This clinic provides aid and relief to the less fortunate residents seeking medical help. At the back of the Madona Clinic was a Rock with a Spring of Water (Bucal ng Tubig) at the Ylang-Ylang River. It was believed to have healing properties or miracles. In 2007 LTO District Office Dasmariñas were established to accommodate the growing number of cars & motors in the city.

==== Burol ====
On the eastern part of Dasmariñas, we can find Barangay Burol which is 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) away from the city center. The complete name of barrio Burol is Pansol-Burol. Pansol is a Tagalog word meaning aqueduct, while Burol, also a native word, means mound. Even though there are no historical records about its establishment, it is safe to say that it was formed during the Spanish period due to the presence of ruins of old Spanish houses and sugarmills. The families of Quillao and Beltran are the first ones to settle in this place. This barangay became the hide-out of the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, there are some Dasmarineños who were killed in this place. They were Alfredo Purificacion, Pedro Calupad, Jose Yñota, Victor de Jesus and Angel Olaes.

==== Langkaan ====
This place is located on the south-western part of Dasmariñas. The name "Langkaan" came from the word "langka" meaning jackfruit; which is believed to be planted in many parts of this barangay during the 1900, the year of its foundation. Barangay Langkaan was a part of a vast hacienda during the Spanich period that's why there are numerous water systems for ricefields that can be found here. The San Agustin Dam was constructed in 1855. On the last part of the 19th century, the Spaniards erected an indigo plantation here. The stone-made grinder of indigo still exists until now and it is the mark of the Spanish influence in the place. The Spaniards are the first ones who planted sugar canes and became the primary source of income during the 18th century. During those times, tarapiche and carabaos are used to make panucha and paldo. Don Placido Campos and Andres Medina are the ones who owned these tarapiche. When the Americans arrived, this place attracted residents from the Poblacion. The families Quillao, Bautista, Sarabusab, Reyes, Remulla, Sango, Laudato, Empeño, Satsatin, Medina, de Lima and others transferred here during those times. During the Second World War, the Japanese had a big plantation of cotton trees in Langkaan. Dasmarineños were forced to work here. A Japanese concentration camp was also established in this area.
Now, Langkaan is considered to be the backbone of the economic progress of Dasmariñas City.

In fact, this was what used to be – a paliparan – meaning an airfield for flying kites. During the Spanish period, the Spaniards used to go to this place during weekends to fly kites of different designs and colors. The first settlers here came from the town of Imus. Among them are the families of Faustino Alvarez, Flaviano Pakingan, Gregorio de la Cruz, Pablo Papa, Dominguez and the Martinez. In 1911, most of the residents here are said to be uneducated because there were only eight persons who can vote.

During the Japanese occupation, some hide-outs of the guerillas were found here such as of "P.Q.O.G., R.C.T.C. Hunters, Reyes Regimen and Saulog Regimen". In June 1943, the Japanese ordered the residents to assemble in front of the school wherein they were not given food and water from morning until evening. Suspected guerrilla members were killed.
