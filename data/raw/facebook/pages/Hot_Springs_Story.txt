== Reception ==

Although Hot Springs Story received mostly positive reviews, the reception was muted compared to the hype and success that Kairosoft's previous Western release, Game Dev Story, garnered; it received an 83/100 from review aggregator website Metacritic. IGN's Levi Buchanan felt that although it lacked the charm of Game Dev Story, that Hot Springs Story was in some ways deeper, with the building aspects giving it more depth overall. TouchArcade noted that although the game could feel daunting at first, it ultimately was an incredibly deep and addicting simulation game. Pocket Gamer's Mike Rose praised the game's content and special features, but felt that the game held little to no direction in the very beginning. Gamezebo's Dan Zuccarelli heavily criticized the game for "playing itself", noting that he fell asleep during one playthrough without it affecting his progress in the game.
