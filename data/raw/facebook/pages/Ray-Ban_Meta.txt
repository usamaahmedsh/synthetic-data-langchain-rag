Ray-Ban Meta is a series of AI glasses created by Meta Platforms and EssilorLuxottica. They include two cameras, open-ear speakers, a microphone, and touchpad built into the frame. They are the second generation of a line of AI glasses released by major companies including Snap Inc and Google.
Unlike other smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses do not include any HUD or AR head-mounted display. Meta announced them on September 27, 2023. They use a Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen1 processor, upgrade of the cameras to 12 MP, improved audio, livestreaming to Facebook and Instagram, and Meta AI. On April 23, 2024, Meta announced an update to Meta AI on the smart glasses to enable multimodal input via computer vision.
They received criticism stemming from mistrust over Facebook’s privacy controls. The small size of the recording indicator light has also led to criticism.


== Partnership and release ==


=== First generation ===
The partnership between EssilorLuxottica, Ray-Ban's parent company, and Facebook to create the first generation of Ray-Ban Stories was publicly announced on September 20, 2020, by CEO Mark Zuckerberg during the seventh annual Facebook Connect conference. During the keynote video, Zuckerberg described several new Facebook innovations, such as the Oculus Quest 2, a new augmented reality division called Project Aria, and the Ray-Ban Stories themselves.
In the following year after its initial announcement, Zuckerberg and Facebook Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth would hint at a 2021 release date through FPV (first person view) video clips appearing to be taken using a Ray-Ban Stories prototype.
On September 9, 2021, Facebook launched Ray-Ban Stories, which were touted as the company's first product related to its plans for a metaverse. It came in two models: Skyler and Wayfarer. 


=== Second generation ===
On October 17, 2023, Meta and Ray-ban released the second generation smart glasses referred to as Meta Smart Glasses.  "Meta Stories" refers to the first generation of smart glasses produced by Meta (formerly Facebook), called Ray-Ban Stories, which primarily focused on capturing photos and videos for social media sharing, while "Meta Smart Glasses" refers to the newer version, Ray-Ban Meta, which includes significant upgrades like improved camera and microphone quality, water resistance, longer recording times, and a voice interface with Meta AI. Reviewers generally regarded the Meta Smart Glasses as an upgrade to the Ray-Ban Stories and described the product positively. The second generation came in three models: Skyler, Wayfarer and Headliner. 


=== Third generation ===
On June 20, 2025, Meta announced the release of a third generation of glasses in partnership with Oakley, Inc. (a EssilorLuxottica subsidiary), the "Oakley Meta" glasses, with a focus on sports and performance lifestyles. The first Oakley Meta glasses were the HSTN (released on August 26, 2025), followed by Vanguard (announced September 18, 2025).
At Meta Connect 2025, the company announced the Meta Ray-Ban Display, the company's first AI glasses with an integrated display and neural wristband. 


== Development ==
According to Facebook, the Luxottica team re-engineered the components of the glasses to fit technology such as: a set of micro-speakers, a three-microphone audio array, an optimized Snapdragon processor, a capacitive touchpad, and a battery. As the glasses are very small, their size caused the engineers to miniaturize each component.
Facebook also states that their engineers used a bass-reflex system in developing the microphones to improve audio quality. For the camera system, an extensive image processing pipeline was utilized to produce high quality video.
To find a viable charging solution, Facebook said they explored multiple solutions and created 20 engineering validation tests to ensure the charging worked.
To address privacy concerns of users and those around them, engineers said they created a hardware power switch and a hardwired LED light to indicate when the camera is recording.


== Components and features ==


=== Hardware ===

Ray-Ban Stories glasses come in three designs: Round, Wayfarer, and Meteor. Each of these designs come in up to six colors with polarized, transitioning, blue-light filtering, and single or progressive prescription lenses. The glasses also come with two cameras – one for pictures and one for video – and connect to the phone with Bluetooth. Photos and videos are automatically stored on the users Facebook account, so an account is necessary for these glasses. The temples of the frames contain speakers and microphones which are used for Facebook Assistant voice control. On the top of the right temple there is a touchpad for touch control to either take a 30-second video by tapping once or take a photo by holding down on the touchpad. Every pair comes with a charging case and USB-C charging cable, which can fully charge the glasses in just over an hour with three hours of battery life. The cameras, microphones, speakers, and touchpad are all connected to a Qualcomm Snapdragon® processor. There is also a corresponding Facebook view app.

== Meta Ray-Ban Display ==
On September 18, 2025, Meta announced Meta Ray-Ban Display at Connect, a new category of AI glasses featuring an integrated display. Unlike previous generations, these glasses include a small full-color, high-resolution display built into the right lens, marking Meta's first smart glasses with visual output capabilities.


=== Features and specifications ===
The Meta Ray-Ban Display features a monocular display with 600×600 pixel resolution integrated into the right lens, offering a 20-degree field of view with 42 pixels per degree. The display brightness ranges from 30 to 5,000 nits and operates at up to 90 Hz refresh rate. The glasses weigh 69 grams (standard size) or 70 grams (large size) and include Transitions lenses as standard.
Technical specifications include:

12 MP camera with 3× digital zoom
Six-microphone array system
Open-ear speakers with Bluetooth 5.3
Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen1 processor
32 GB internal storage
2 GB LPDDR4x RAM
Wi-Fi 6 connectivity
IPX4 water resistance rating


=== Meta Neural Band ===
Each Meta Ray-Ban Display comes bundled with the Meta Neural Band, a surface electromyography (sEMG) wristband that interprets muscle signals from the wrist to control the glasses through subtle hand gestures. The band weighs 42 grams, provides up to 18 hours of battery life, and has an IPX7 water resistance rating. It uses on-device machine learning to translate EMG signals into digital commands, allowing users to navigate interfaces, scroll content, and interact with applications without touching the glasses. The technology was developed using deep learning algorithms based on data from nearly 200,000 consenting research participants.


=== Functionality ===
The display enables several new features beyond those available in previous Ray-Ban Meta glasses:

Visual responses from Meta AI, showing answers and step-by-step instructions
Private messaging display for WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram
Live video calling with screen sharing capabilities
Turn-by-turn pedestrian navigation with visual maps (launching in beta for select cities)
Real-time translation and live captions for conversations
Camera viewfinder with zoom functionality
Music playback controls with album art display


=== Release and pricing ===
Meta Ray-Ban Display launched on September 30, 2025, in the United States at select retailers including Best Buy, LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, and Ray-Ban stores, with Verizon locations following soon after. The glasses are priced at $799 USD, which includes both the glasses and Meta Neural Band. They are available in two colors (Black and Sand) and two frame sizes (standard and large). Meta announced plans to expand availability to Canada, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom in early 2026.
The glasses provide up to 6 hours of mixed-use battery life, with the collapsible charging case providing an additional 24 hours of usage (30 hours total). The Meta Neural Band charges separately and offers 18 hours of battery life.


=== History ===
Prior to their reveal of the Meta Ray-Ban Display, at Connect 2024, Meta presented Orion, its first pair of augmented reality glasses. Though Orion was originally intended to be sold to consumers, the manufacturing process turned out to be too complex and expensive. Instead, the company pivoted to producing a small number of the glasses to be used internally as a developer kit as they continue to explore ways to bring it to consumers. Meta's Orion prototype represents their vision for what true 6DOF AR glasses could look like and should not be confused with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses.


== Privacy and ethical concerns ==
Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have been released amid much debate about privacy and ethics. The glasses are designed to look like conventional Ray-Ban sunglasses, so critics fear users will be able to record or photograph those around them without their consent, raising fears about surveillance in public and private spaces. The glasses have a small white LED light that activates to show that they are recording, but whether this notification is visible or effective, especially in low-light situations, has come under scrutiny. 404 Media released an investigation into a cheap modification kit that can disable the recording light, further raising privacy and ethical concerns.
A significant concern surrounding the device's listening capabilities is the risk of eavesdropping. As the glasses have multiple microphones for capturing audio, there are fears that they could inadvertently or intentionally record conversations without the awareness of those nearby. This could lead to privacy violations, particularly in private settings or sensitive environments. While Meta asserts that the glasses activate only upon hearing the “Hey, Facebook” wake phrase, skeptics remain wary of potential unauthorized data collection. The Facebook View app's privacy policy states that users’ voice commands may be sent to Meta's servers unless explicitly opted out, a detail that has fueled broader concerns about transparency and data control.
Another contentious issue is data storage and access. The recording capabilities of the glasses, particularly when coupled with Meta's AI technology, raise questions about how data is stored, who has access to it, and how it is protected from misuse or breaches. Concerns about how long data is retained and whether it could be used for commercial or surveillance purposes are prominent.
There are ethical reviews and academic studies that criticize and highlight possible misuse of the features. One impactful 2024 study showed that hacked Ray-Ban Meta glasses could engage in real-time recognition, raising anxiety about mass surveillance and profiling. Given such risks, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has asked for tougher action to ensure the glasses comply with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules.
Despite these concerns, advocates of the glasses highlight potential benefits, such as it offering assistance for visually impaired people, and hands-free communication. Critics, however, believe that these advancements must be accompanied by robust privacy protections and ethical usage guidelines. Meta's official recommendations, which include things like letting people maintain personal boundaries and switching off the device in sensitive environments, are designed to encourage responsible use but may not do much to relieve deeper systemic issues related to surveillance.
Harvard University students used PimEyes on the glasses to see information (including names, phone numbers and home address) in real time from just a face captured by the glasses. A meta spokesperson said, "Pimeyes (...) could be used with ANY camera (...) this isn't something that only is possible because of Meta Ray-Bans" but 404 Media noted that the students "choose to use Meta’s Ray Bans: because in passing, they look just like any other pair of glasses".
