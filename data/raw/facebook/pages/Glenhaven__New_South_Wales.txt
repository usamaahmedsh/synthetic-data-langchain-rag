Glenhaven is a semi rural suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 32 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of The Hills Shire, part of the Hills District.


== History ==
The area was originally called Sandhurst, which remains Glenhaven's most prominent street. Crego Road, which runs off Sandhurst is the highest. There was some confusion with mail because of a suburb in Melbourne with the same name. A public meeting was held to have the name changed to reflect its valley location. The upper portion of the valley was known as "The Glen", and the lower portion as "The Haven", hence the choice Glenhaven.
Glenhaven is on the route of the Great North Road that linked Parramatta with the Hunter Valley. John Evans, one of the first settlers in the area, used a bullock team to drag timber, and the route he used became known as Evans Road. The area had many wild flowers, including waratahs, Christmas bush, boronias, native roses, and a variety of orchids which thrived there.
Sandhurst Post Office opened on 11 July 1892 and was renamed Glenhaven on 1 January 1893. It closed in 1972.
