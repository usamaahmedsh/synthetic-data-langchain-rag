Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? is the debut studio album by Irish alternative rock band the Cranberries. Released on 1 March 1993 through Island Records after four EPs, it is both the band's first full-length album and major label release. The album was written entirely by the band's lead singer Dolores O'Riordan and guitarist Noel Hogan and contains the band's highest charting US single, "Linger". The album reached number one on the UK and the Irish albums charts. It spent a total of 86 weeks on the UK chart. On 24 June 1994, it became the fifth album in rock history to reach number one more than a year after release. At the end of 1995, it ranked as the 50th best selling album in Australia. It reached number 18 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart and stayed on this chart for 136 weeks; the album sold six million copies worldwide.
On 7 March 2018, the band's three remaining members announced they were releasing a special 25th anniversary newly remastered anniversary edition of the album, with previously unreleased material as well as other bonus material from the era of the album. However, it was delayed until late 2018, following the death of O'Riordan.
