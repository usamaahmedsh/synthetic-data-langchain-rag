Nerf is a toy brand formed by Parker Brothers and currently owned by Hasbro. Most of the toys are a variety of foam-based weaponry, with other Nerf products including balls for sports such as American football, basketball, and baseball. Their best known toys are their dart guns (referred to by Hasbro as "blasters") that shoot ammunition made from "Nerf foam" (partially reticulated polyether type polyurethane foam). Their primary slogan, introduced in the 1990s, is "It's Nerf or Nothin'!".  Annual revenues under the Nerf brand are approximately US$400 million.


== History ==

Parker Brothers originally developed Nerf, beginning with a four-inch (100 mm) polyurethane foam ball. In 1969, Reyn Guyer, a Minnesota-based games inventor, and Minnesota Vikings kicker Fred Cox came to the company with a football game that was safe for indoor play, and after studying it carefully, Parker Brothers decided to eliminate everything but the foam ball. The inventors' in-house name for the ball was the "falsie-ball," referencing the sculpted padding for bras used to create the appearance of larger breasts. Parker Brothers instead chose the name "Nerf," taken from Nerf bars, the protective tubing used to avoid minor collisions during off-roading.
In 1970, the Nerf ball was introduced as the "world's first official indoor ball." Marketing slogans promised that one can "Throw it indoors; you can't damage lamps or break windows. You can't hurt babies or old people." Some of the first TV commercials for the balls were joint promotions with General Foods' Kool-Aid drink mix, with Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones and Michael Nesmith of the Monkees playing with the balls on a living room soundstage (Kool-Aid sponsored the 1969–70 Saturday morning reruns of the Monkees' 1966–67 TV series). The ball filled a strong consumer need and by the year's end, more than four million Nerf balls had been sold. The four-inch (100 mm) ball was followed by a large version called the "Super Nerf Ball". Shortly after, in 1972, a basketball game called "Nerfoop" and the Nerf football (developed by longtime NFL kicker Fred Cox) joined the family, with the latter quickly becoming Nerf's most popular ball.
The company continued to add to the Nerf line until they handed control to Kenner Products, a sister company.  In 1987, Kenner was bought by the Tonka Corporation, which itself was purchased by Hasbro in 1991, which then became the owner of Nerf. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the Nerf brand served under the subsidiaries OddzOn and Larami before Hasbro took full control of the brand.
Nerf released the first foam dart blaster in 1992. Over the years, Nerf has continued to expand the line, adding new looks to existing products, with later lines of Nerf products ranging from sport balls and foam dart blasters to video games and accessories.
In February 2013, Hasbro announced the launch of a new product line called Rebelle, designed to appeal to a female demographic. The line featured blasters with aesthetics and color schemes distinct from other Nerf lines, while maintaining internal mechanics similar to the N-Strike Elite series. The first Rebelle products were released later that year.
Later in November 2013, POW! Books released The Ultimate Nerf Blaster Book, written by Nathaniel Marunas. The publication chronicled the brand’s evolution and provided detailed information on all N-Strike, Dart Tag, and Vortex blasters available at the time of release.
In 2015, Nerf introduced the Rival series, aimed at older users seeking greater performance. The initial blasters in this line, the Apollo XV-700 and Zeus MXV-1200, fired a new type of foam ammunition called High Impact Rounds—spherical projectiles capable of reaching higher velocities than traditional darts. Rival products are generally recommended for ages 14 and up.
Continuing its innovation in foam-based ammunition, Nerf unveiled the Hyper series in 2021. The initial offerings—Hyper Rush-40, Hyper Siege-50, and Hyper Mach-100—featured a new type of round similar in concept to Rival’s, but smaller and composed of a thermoplastic elastomer material, offering a more rubber-like texture compared to traditional foam.


== Products ==


=== Nerf Blasters ===

Nerf's most popular product type are Nerf blasters, which are toy plastic guns that shoot foam darts. These darts have different-style tips, including Velcro-tipped in order to stick to Nerf vests (typically shipped with Dart Tag blasters), suction cup darts designed to stick to smooth surfaces, streamlined darts to fit into magazines (referred to as clips by Nerf), and darts able to whistle in flight. Darts may also have different colors, such as colors that reflect certain sub-lines, camouflage, and glow in the dark. Most Nerf blasters also have rails, known as tactical rails, which can accommodate different attachments, as well as special adapters such as barrel and stock adapters. The "N-strike" sub-line was launched in 2004, and is styled more like a real weapon than previous Nerf products. It was updated in 2012 as N-Strike Elite.


==== Rebelle ====
Released in 2013, the Rebelle line was a series of blasters predominantly aimed at the female demographic, with similar internal mechanics to the Nerf N-Strike elite line, sporting pink, purple and teal colors.


==== Zombie Strike ====
The Zombie Strike line was launched in 2013, and is geared for fans of Humans vs. Zombies games.


==== Rival ====
Nerf Rival blasters are targeted towards an older target market than Nerf's better-known dart blasters.


==== Nitro ====
In 2017, Hasbro released the Nerf Nitro line, which consists of blasters that fire foam cars into obstacles and stunt ramps.


==== Ultra ====
Released in September 2019, Nerf Ultra (branded as ULTRA) blasters fire a new, proprietary dart design that is marketed as "THE FARTHEST FLYING DART EVER. Darts can travel up to 120 feet."  The new Ultra darts are constructed from a lightweight foam that is notably different from traditional darts in that they are made with closed-cell, rather than open-cell foam.  This construction allows for fins to be molded into the rear of the darts.  Size-wise, Ultra darts are between N-Strike Elite darts and Mega darts in diameter, but shorter than both in length.  They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines' darts be fired from Ultra blasters. This design was created in response to the growing number of third-party darts, including exact knockoffs from China, available for N-Strike Elite blasters at a much lower cost than Nerf-brand darts.


=== N-Series ===
Released in mid‑2024, the N-Series introduced the proprietary N1 dart—shorter, wider, and aerodynamically optimized—only compatible with N-Series blasters. Hasbro has stated plans to phase out the Elite dart format.

Originally owned and marketed by Larami, Super Soaker is a popular line of water guns. Recently, Hasbro has released a line of Nerf-branded Super Soaker blasters.

Based in Secaucus, N.J., Gramercy Products, Inc. is the manufacturer of Nerf Dog products.

The lawsuit stated that Buzz Bee and Lanard infringed two U.S. patents for the Nerf N-Strike Disc Shot blaster, while Buzz Bee infringed on a Super Soaker patent. In November of that year, Hasbro won its patent case against Buzz Bee with the latter banned from producing certain water guns.
In April 2012, Hasbro contacted the Australia-based fan blog Urban Taggers for leaking information on unreleased Nerf products found on the Chinese marketplace website Taobao. Hasbro allegedly tricked one of the bloggers into disclosing his home address for their lawyers to mail him a cease and desist letter. The incident resulted in fans setting up a campaign on Facebook boycotting Hasbro.
