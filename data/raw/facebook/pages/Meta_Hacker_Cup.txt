Meta Hacker Cup (formerly known as Facebook Hacker Cup) is an annual international programming competition hosted and administered by Meta Platforms. The competition began in 2011 as a means to identify top engineering talent for potential employment at Meta Platforms.  The competition consists of a set of algorithmic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any programming language and development environment to write their solutions.
Facebook Hacker Cup is part of a circuit of annual international programming contests that included Google Code Jam, Topcoder Open, and the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. It has been featured in articles from Bloomberg and Stack Overflow.
