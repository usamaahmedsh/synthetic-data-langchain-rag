== Reception ==
In a negative review, The Ringer's Kate Knibbs criticized the series saying, "Every era gets the Punk'd it deserves, and we are living through a spectacularly dumb and cruel moment. There’s something fitting about how Facebook, notorious for flooding the internet with viral garbage, debuted an accidental, weirdly cruel anti-comedy in its push for original content. You Kiddin’ Me?! isn't funny."
