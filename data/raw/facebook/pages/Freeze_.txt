== Gameplay ==
As a small round hero in eye shape it is necessary to solve different puzzles. The player does not control the character itself, but the prison cells. With the "Freeze" Button the gravity can be deactivated and the eye remains in its place. The cells can be turned to the right position. If you activate the gravity again, the eye drops in the adjusted direction. Deadly stings and various enemies complicate the levels.


== Reception ==
The game won Casual Games Association's Indie Prize Europe 2013 award. It is also one of the ten best games in 2013 of the Android Quality Index. 
The game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic.
