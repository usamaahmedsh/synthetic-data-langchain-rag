Their success in children's television came in 1987, with the launch of their iconic children's show, ChuckleVision, in which their real-life siblings Jimmy and Brian Patton made occasional appearances. The show proved a ratings hit with children, running for 21 series over a period of 22 years, and giving them a Special Award for Lifetime Achievement at the British Academy Children's Awards in 2008. The final series of the programme was aired in December 2009.
The two contributed further to children's entertainment, performing at the Children's Royal Variety Performance in May 1992, and launching a children's game show titled To Me... To You..., which ran between 1996 and 1998 and which took its name from their signature catchphrase.

== Critical reception ==
In November 2005, Jacques Peretti, a reporter for The Guardian, remarked "The appeal of the Chuckle Brothers remains a mystery to anyone over eight, but to anyone under eight, they're the ultimate entertainment experience. The little people think they're hilarious, and if you add up all the little people across the country who think they're hilarious, you'd think it's ChuckleVision that should have the 28 comedy gongs, not Little Britain or The Office."
On 31 January 2007, Rotherham United chairman Denis Coleman announced that the brothers had both been made honorary presidents of the football club.
In 2008, they were honoured with the Special Award at the British Academy Children's Awards.


== Personal life ==
The brothers regularly appeared at events and openings, an example being the unveiling of the Tropical Butterfly House, Wildlife and Falconry Centre in North Anston in South Yorkshire in July 2013, which Barry attended. Supporters of Rotherham United Football Club, they were made Honorary Life Presidents of the club in 2007.
Both brothers have been married. Barry was married to Ann from 1973 until his death and Paul has been married to Sue since 1988. Both brothers were smokers, although Paul had apparently quit by 2000. Paul lives in Serlby, Doncaster, while Barry lived in Ravenfield, Rotherham, until his death.
In April 2007, while on holiday on the Greek island of Cephalonia, Paul broke his nose and suffered cuts and bruises when he lost control of his motorcycle after suddenly braking to avoid a goatherd and his herd. It was reported at the time that, instead of helping him, tourists who stopped at the accident shouted the Chuckle Brothers' catchphrase, "To me, to you". Paul later revealed on Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast that the story of tourists shouting out catchphrases was an invention in order to get the story in the newspapers.
An urban legend surrounding Barry Chuckle's supposed death from a heart attack had circulated since at least 2008. In 2010, the brothers issued a statement on their website stating that the story was "complete and utter rubbish". The BBC reported that the death hoaxes had upset young viewers, and had shocked Barry when they re-surfaced. The hoax was said to have initially spread via Facebook in 2008, but re-surfaced in 2010 via Twitter.
In December 2010, Barry announced his support for a proposal that one of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government's planned free schools, a taxpayer-funded school independent of the local authority, should be established in Rotherham. In January 2011, it was announced that Barry had planned to incorporate a 100-pupil free school named Rotherham Central Free School in his hometown of Rotherham. His son's partner was to serve as the head teacher of the school. By February 2012, no premises, staff or pupils for the school had been confirmed, despite announcing an intention on opening in September of that year.
In February 2014, the Chuckle Brothers attended the trial of Dave Lee Travis. Paul stated that he had no knowledge of the alleged events. After giving evidence, the pair posed for a selfie outside Southwark Crown Court with Paul sharing it on his Twitter account. The Brothers had smiled for the photograph, and some deemed their actions inappropriate.
In March 2016, Barry received condemnation for sharing a Facebook post from the far-right political party Britain First. The post, originally shared in June 2015, called on politicians to strip migrants of their citizenship if they left the country to join a terror group. Following the unearthing of the post, Tommy Robinson, former leader of the English Defence League (EDL), came to Barry's defence, calling on people to "leave the man alone". Britain First subsequently described the incident as a "non-story".
In March 2020, Paul contracted COVID-19 and suffered mild illness (which he described as "not nice"). He recorded a video message for his Twitter followers, urging them to stay at home to slow the spread of the disease.


=== Barry's death ===
On 5 August 2018, Barry died after a period of ill health. Paul grieved Barry's death: "I've not just lost my brother, I've lost my theatrical partner of many, many years and my very best friend."
Paul later revealed that his brother had been diagnosed with bone cancer, but had kept it secret from his manager, fans and Paul himself as he had wanted to perform for as long as possible. His funeral was held on 17 August at the New York Stadium, where Rotherham United play their home matches, and was attended by a number of show business friends; a large number of fans waited outside to pay their respects.
