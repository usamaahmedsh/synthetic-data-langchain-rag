This list of most-downloaded Google Play Store applications includes most of the free apps that have been downloaded at least 500 million times. As of 2024, thousands of Android applications have surpassed the one-million download milestone, with a significant subset reaching even higher thresholds. For context, in July 2017 that there are 319 apps which have been downloaded at least 100 million times and 4,098 apps have been downloaded at least ten million times. The 100-million download threshold for free applications has been established to maintain the list's manageability and focus on the most widely distributed apps. It's worth noting that many of the applications in this list are distributed pre-installed on top-selling Android devices and may be considered bloatware by some people because users did not actively choose to download them.
