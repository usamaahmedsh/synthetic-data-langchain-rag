RaiPlay is an Italian subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned by RAI. The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by RAI.


== History ==
RaiPlay was created on 9 January 2007 as Rai.tv and operated by Rai Net (now Rai). The website allowed viewers to watch and listen to programs entirely or partially produced by Rai. The availability of programs was subject to copyright. The website also hosted exclusive content including interviews, extras, specials and blogs. A podcasting service was also made available from RaiPlay. Until January 2009, the app used by the site to play files had been Windows Media Player 11. Since February 2009, Rai.tv used Silverlight for video streaming while choosing Silverlight or RealPlayer for audio content (of radio channels). Microsoft Silverlight limited the availability of live video streaming exclusively to Microsoft users.
From 2007 to 2014 many videos have been available on the Rai's YouTube channel, but in 2014 the broadcaster decided not to renew the partnership with the famous web site, removing 150 000 videos in a 9 year period. The economic loss due to this decision has been estimated at €1,5 million.
On 12 September 2016, Rai.tv became RaiPlay, renewing its graphics and functions but not including the live streaming or radio content. RaiPlay has been available on smart TVs since December 2016.
Since 1 June 2017, during the airing of the second season of Non uccidere, all episodes of new seasons belonging to Rai series or purchased from other broadcasters were made available online via RaiPlay Anteprima.
On 30 October 2019 a huge update was released, making the app look more similar to other services like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. On 5 November of the same year, the first original show of the service, Viva RaiPlay!, was released. This program also aired on Rai 1 until 8 November. On 13 November, it became a RaiPlay exclusive.
