Red Moon is a free software application for the Android operating system, designed to filter blue light from the device's display, helping reduce eye strain during night-time use and disruption of sleep patterns. It allows independent adjustment of colour temperature, luminosity and filter level, making it also possible to lower the effective screen brightness below the usual minimum brightness level of the device. Red Moon does not require root.
