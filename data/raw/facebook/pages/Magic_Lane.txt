== Route 66 ==
Route 66 was founded in 1992. In 1999 the company opened a software development center in Brașov, Romania. In 2005 the company moved all its research and development operations to the aforementioned location, which at that date employed 45 of the company's total of 65 employees. In 2008, the company announced 2.4 million euros in revenue. In 2010, the company had 92 employees, of which 65 were software developers.
The Nokia 6110 Navigator delivered with Route 66 was the first mobile phone with on-board navigation installed as standard, apart from smartphones with their significantly larger dimensions and heavier weight.
The current founder of Magic Lane previously developed the Route 66 route planner in the 1990s, which was among the first navigation products for Macintosh, PC, and early mobile phones. They established General Magic to rebuild their software, focusing on privacy, offline functionality, lightweight hardware usage and multi SDK support. Their end user product was Magic Earth, which was used as a testing ground for their developments on Android and iOS platforms.


=== Route 6 Navigate ===
In November 2013, Route 66 launched Navigate 6.
The continuation of Route 66 Navigate was carried out after the company rebranded as General Magic, with the introduction of the navigation app Magic Earth as a testing ground for Android and iOS, made first available in 2015 on Android.
In 2016, Route 66 Navigate was discontinued completely and replaced by the pro version of Magic Earth.

Magic Lane's Software Development Kit (SDK) allows companies to add mapping, location, and navigation functionality into vehicles, apps, and online platforms in several programming languages.

Magic Lane's datacenters are located in Europe.


=== Magic Earth ===
Magic Earth is built on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data with a focus on privacy and around 2,000 data sources to calculate routes for pedestrians, cars and bicycles. It also provides turn-by-turn navigation for driving, biking, walking, and public transportation. The application also works offline, with offline OSM data for 233 countries and regions. It can display 2D, 3D and satellite maps as well as location data for parking and details like route surface, difficulty and elevation. Navigation includes speed camera alerts, live traffic updates, and speed warnings in supported regions. The app also includes a speedometer that remains on even when not navigating. Magic Earth works on Android and iOS devices and supports Android Auto, Apple CarPlay  and Apple Watch  integration.
Magic Earth does not collect personal data. Revenue is generated through a subscription fee of €0.99/year and developer SDK sales. The /e/ Operating System, which aims to be a privacy-focused alternative to Android, uses Magic Earth as the default navigation application, with the explanation that Magic Lane provided the /e/OS developers sufficient documentation about privacy behavior to include the application in the OS.
Due to having the exact same name, the application is sometimes confused with Magic Earth Inc., a gas and oil industry data visualization software company, founded in 1999 and acquired by Halliburton in 2001.
