In July 2015 Mayor Patrick Rushing was asked to resign by the city council because he called President Barack Obama a "monkey man" and First Lady Michelle Obama a "gorilla" on his Facebook page. Rushing initially refused, stating he was not a racist. This follows an earlier incident in 2015 in which Rushing resigned his position as a school bus driver after he was charged with a misdemeanor for leaving the scene of an accident.
In August 2015 Rushing submitted his resignation. He stated, "I find it difficult to continue due to my declining health issues." He was succeeded by then-Deputy Mayor Kevin Richey.
