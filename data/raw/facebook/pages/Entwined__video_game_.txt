== Reception ==

Entwined received "mixed" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
The Digital Fix gave it a score of eight out of ten and said that the game "blends its gameplay, visuals and soundtrack into one beautiful piece of art that should be experienced by anyone who has the chance to play it." However, The Escapist gave it three stars out of five and stated, "While its skin-deep qualities suggest something artistic and maybe a little philosophical, this middling arcade game packs not enough wallop to be worth more than a bit of a shrug. While not awful, it's certainly not intriguing enough to maintain interest even in spite of a brief running time." National Post gave it five out of ten and stated that the game "never manages to deliver much beyond art and beauty."
