== Early life ==
Innes was born on October 1, 1966, in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. He had a passion for doing cartoon voices at a young age, and discovered his ability to mimic voices, including Scooby-Doo, of whom Innes became a fan in the early 1970s. He would listen to the actors performing the voices and watch how they created them, and learn how to do it himself. He would also recreate scenes from the series in his head at night to make himself fall asleep.


== Career ==
Becoming a radio personality at the age of 12, Innes did interviews with actors like Don Messick, the voice of Scooby-Doo; Daws Butler, and Mel Blanc. In 1980, Innes became a disc jockey at the age of 14 upon his debut on KLID in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. In 1990, he started working as a morning announcer for WABB-FM. During his spare time, he would imitate famous people over the intercommunications system, and had fun with other employees at the station. He was later fired in order for him to expand his vocal abilities. In 1991–1996, Innes was the host of Innes and Company on KKHT-FM in Springfield, Illinois. He did a remix of "Wind Beneath My Wings" by Bette Midler, named "Dear Daddy: The Wind Beneath My Wings", featuring his son Josh Innes. The song was played as a requested track on more than 400 radio stations in America. Innes also co-ran American Top 40 with Casey Kasem, the voice of Norville "Shaggy" Rogers in Scooby-Doo, whom Innes imitated when listening to him do the character's voice. He also tried his Scooby imitation, to which Messick told him, "You've got that Scooby down."
In 1996, Innes and Jim Hogg created Hollywood Hal and Rhinestone Al With the Wannabees, a show aimed at pre-kindergarteners that taught them about manners, safety, sharing, love, staying away from drugs, and other values. In 1997, Innes started working as the morning host of WRQQ and as the afternoon air personality at the country radio station WYNK-FM, both in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. At the former station, he performed a remix of "Dancin', Shaggin' on the Boulevard" by Alabama called "Shaggy on the Boulevard", sung in Shaggy's voice. Following Don Messick's retirement and death and Casey Kasem quitting the role of Shaggy, Innes became the voice of Scooby-Doo and Shaggy between 1998 and 2001, beginning with the film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (Scooby) and the television special Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes (Shaggy); Innes also voiced Shaggy in promotions for said film. He continued to voice Scooby and Shaggy in 2002–2009 in most video games, PC games, toys, and commercials. Since 2010, he has been sporadically voicing the characters for toys, certain commercials such as McDonald's, Halifax, and Walmart, as well as Scooby-Doo! The Museum of Mysteries at Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi, and in the Scooby-Doo Playmobil shorts for WB Kids. In the Playmobil shorts and one of the McDonald's commercials, he also provided the voice of Fred Jones. Innes has also voiced Scooby's nephew, Scrappy-Doo, in the live-action film Scooby-Doo (2002), the television special The Scooby-Doo Project, video games, commercials, theme park attractions, toys, and the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law episode "Shaggy Busted".
Innes voiced Astro from The Jetsons in a series of RadioShack commercials in the late 1990s, and Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble in a Toshiba commercial in 2002. He has briefly voiced other characters, including Yogi Bear, Boo-Boo Bear, Ranger Smith, Wally Gator, Quick Draw McGraw, Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Foghorn Leghorn, Muttley, Professor Pat Pending, Snagglepuss, Captain Caveman, Shag Rugg, Droopy and Papa Smurf. Innes auditioned to voice Yogi and Boo-Boo for the film Yogi Bear (2010), but lost to Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake. He also auditioned to return as Shaggy for the television series Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, but lost the role to Matthew Lillard, who previously portrayed Shaggy in the 2002 film and its sequel Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004).
In 2003, Innes wrote the song "Handprints on the Wall", which was performed by Kenny Rogers. He is currently the publisher and author of Hug Magazine since 2010. In October 2011, he was fired from WYNK-FM as part of a new programming strategy and staff changes by Clear Channel Radio. On April 21, 2016, he joined nearby station WRKN in the same position of afternoon air personality.
