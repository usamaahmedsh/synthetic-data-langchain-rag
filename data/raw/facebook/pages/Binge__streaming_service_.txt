Binge is an Australian subscription video on-demand service owned by Hubbl, a subsidiary of Foxtel. The service is devoted primarily to entertainment content, including television series and films.


== History ==
In August 2018 it was reported Foxtel were expected to announce an entertainment subscription video on demand (SVOD) service. The service, internally codenamed Project Jupiter, aimed to combat the building competition from streaming services such as Netflix, Stan, and Amazon Prime Video. This new service would complement Foxtel's sports SVOD service which had been given the go-ahead (later launched as Kayo Sports) as well as offer an alternative to traditional satellite and cable Foxtel services.
In October 2018, it was reported that Project Jupiter would launch in the first half of 2019 to coincide with the final season of Game of Thrones. In March 2019 it was reported Foxtel had green-lit Project Jupiter, however, it would not launch in early 2019 as previously reported. In September 2019 it was reported Foxtel had assembled a staff of 40 ahead of the launch who were located within the same facility as sister-company Kayo Sports. It was also noted the service's code name had changed from Project Jupiter to Project Ares.
On 23 May 2020 it was announced the new service would be called Binge. It officially launched on 25 May 2020.

== Content ==
At launch Binge was reported to offer over 10,000 hours of entertainment, lifestyle, reality and movie content without advertisements, which was expected to expand to 20,000 hours of content within 12 months.


=== Output deals ===
Binge's content is drawn primarily from output deals with Foxtel. Not all content available on Foxtel may be available on Binge due to competing agreements with other distributors (including other Australian TV channels) and/or streaming services in Australia.
Ahead of Binge's launch, Foxtel and Binge acquired Australian rights to HBO Max original programmes distributed by Warner Bros. Television Studios. In September 2022, Foxtel announced that WWE Network content would move exclusively to Binge in January 2023. HBO Max is now confirmed to launch in Australia as a stand-alone streaming service on 31 March 2025, around the same time their deal with parent company Warner Bros. Discovery expires. Foxtel will however instead include the streaming app and its subscription to the basic with ads plan on their IQ boxes for Foxtel subscribers at launch at no extra cost, confirming that nearly all HBO and Warner Bros. Discovery content will migrate to Max app upon arrival, meaning that Foxtel will now act as HBO Max's launch partner instead via a new deal. In addition, WWE programming was removed from Binge in a two-stage set-up in late 2024, due to the move of all WWE programming to Netflix. The first stage saw live WWE content drop off of the Fox8 schedule in September 2024, and the second stage saw all remaining programming dropped on New Year's Day 2025, with the Australian WWE Network channel closing as a result.
Some of Binge's suppliers include:


=== Movies ===
Binge has access to some of Foxtel movie output deals for movies including Australian cinema, Hollywood blockbusters, British films, independent film and other global releases. Binge may or may not share a same day release with Foxtel's Foxtel Movies release depending on the title and the output deal with its distributor. Some blockbusters like  Universal Pictures’ Fast & Furious franchise had an exclusive window on Foxtel's Movies Package before being made available to Binge and other Foxtel on demand subscribes.
