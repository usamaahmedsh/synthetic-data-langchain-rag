The Tattoo Shop is an American reality show series that premiered on March 15, 2018 on Facebook Watch. It follows a group of tattoo artists as they open up a new shop in Miami, Florida.
The show airs two episodes per week, with Thursdays offering a behind-the-scenes look into the lives of the artists and their clients. Friday's episodes feature a live tattoo experience on "Mystery Tattoo". Each week, a client agrees to get a tattoo, sight unseen. This tattoo is left in the hands of the Facebook community, who make the creative decisions on the design and where the art is drawn on the body.
