Facebook F8 was a mostly-annual conference held by Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) from 2007 to 2021, intended for developers and entrepreneurs who build products and services around the website. The event generally started with a keynote speech by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, followed by various breakout sessions concentrating on specific topics. Facebook often introduced new features and made new announcements at the conference.
The "F8" name comes from Facebook's tradition of 8 hour hackathons.
Facebook F8 was hosted in San Francisco, California from 2007 to 2016, then in a more central Silicon Valley location in San Jose, California from 2017 to 2019. In 2020 and 2021, it was a virtual event due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no F8 event in 2009, 2012, 2013.
