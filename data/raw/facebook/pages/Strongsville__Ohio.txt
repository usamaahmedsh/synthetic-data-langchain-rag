Strongsville is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States, and a suburb of Cleveland. As of the 2020 census, its population was 46,491.
The city's nickname, Crossroads of the Nation, originated from the intersection between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Southwestern Electric Line that connected Cleveland and Wooster, Ohio. As the railroad line ceased operation in 1931, the motto and city seal have been adapted to reflect the modern-day intersection of Interstate 71 and the Ohio Turnpike.


== History ==
Founded by settlers arriving in the newly purchased Connecticut Western Reserve, the city was named after John Stoughton Strong, the group's leader. He brought his oldest son, Emory Strong, his brother-in-law Elijah Lyman Sr., and Guilford Whitney, another relative of the Strongs. Along with Whitney came his daughter, her husband John Hilliard, and their daughter. Other pioneers in the group included William Fuller Jr., Obadiah Church, Zachariah Goodale, and George Fox Gilbert. They arrived in 1816 and cleared enough land to construct log cabins. The 25-square-mile area of land was surveyed and divided into lots for John Stoughton Strong to sell off by agreement with Oliver Ellsworth of Hartford, Connecticut. Strongsville officially became Township No. 5, 14th range on February 25, 1818. Strongsville then became a village in 1923 and was ultimately designated a city in 1961.
John Stoughton Strong, originally from Vermont, was instrumental in Strongsville's establishment and early growth. He drew in settlers from New York, Pennsylvania, and New England by driving cattle that he obtained to markets in those states. In the following years, he oversaw the development of settlements, roads, businesses, schools, and churches. He had the first mill built in 1820 on the Rocky River in Albion. While it is no longer standing, the dam and foundation still exist in what is now Bonnie Park. He also brought in settlers with specialized skills, such as Dr. William Baldwin as the town doctor. The John Stoughton Strong House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 24, 1980.
Many of the main streets in the city are named after other principal figures and landowners from the city's history, e.g. Howe, Drake, Shurmer, and Whitney.

The Pomeroy House, built in 1847, was known as the Homestead for over a century. Alanson Pomeroy, the homeowner and prominent Strongsville resident, hosted members of the Congregational Church of which he was an active member, and opened his spare room to travelers. During the Civil War, the Homestead became a stop on the Underground Railroad, where he concealed runaway slaves on his property. From this residence in Strongsville, the runaway slaves were taken to boats on the Rocky River for passage to Canada. The Alanson Pomeroy House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in June 1975. After a few years of renovation, it opened as Don's Pomeroy House Restaurant & Pub in 1980. Guests can dine in the library, the old dining room, the study, or the parlor. The pub is located downstairs and the upstairs bedrooms now serve as private dining rooms.
In 1853, John D. Rockefeller's family moved to Strongsville. At the time, Rockefeller was only a child.
On April 11, 1965, an F4 tornado hit Strongsville; it was part of the 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak.

Strongsville High School serves students in grades 9 through 12.  The city's five elementary schools serve pre-kindergarten through 5th grade: Chapman, Kinsner, Muraski, Surrarrer, and Whitney. With Strongsville's younger student population on the decline, three elementary schools, Allen, Drake and Zellers, closed their doors in recent years. A private Catholic school, St. Joseph and John's, serves children through the 8th grade. In 2012, citizens approved a bond issue for $81 million. The bond money was used to build a new middle school, combining the old Center and Albion middle schools, renovations to the high school, technology upgrades to the elementary schools, and renovations to the preschool. The new middle school was built just in time for the 2016–2017 school year.


=== 2013 Strongsville City Teachers' Strike ===
The Strongsville City Teachers' Strike was a labor strike organized by the Strongsville Education Association that lasted for eight weeks.
The strike commenced at 12:01 a.m. on March 4, 2013. The dispute is over a number of issues, notably teacher contracts, pay step increases, health insurance premium costs, and general working conditions. The Strongsville Education Association claims the Board does have the money to meet the teachers' salary requirements, but that "the 'projection' figures released by the Board on its website are no more than arbitrary, meaningless figures." The Strongsville Board of Education attests that the district is currently "operating in the red", meaning the district budget deficit will increase drastically if the status quo remains. Several rounds of negotiations over said issues between the S.E.A. and the B.O.E. have taken place since March 2010. The strike ended after eight weeks.
