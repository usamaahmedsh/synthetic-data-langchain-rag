Whopper Sacrifice was an advertising campaign by Burger King which was launched in January 2009. After unfriending 10 people on Facebook, participants became eligible for a free Whopper from Burger King. Sacrifices were made known via posts reading, “(Participant) sacrificed (victim) for a free Whopper.” The promotion was disabled by Facebook after 10 days. The campaign was developed by Crispin Porter + Bogusky.
