In September 2016, the technation team had a collaboration with M.anifest to release his album "No Where Cool " album on 15ghana.com, an eCommerce website. The album upon release sold over a thousand copies all over the country within a week. The sale of M.anifest's album presented several challenges especially in regard to delivery since the project involved the sale CDs. These challenges and the overall success of the project led the technation gh team to come up with the idea for aftown coined from the words Africa and Town.
In October, 2016 aftown was officially launched. Upon its launch aftownmusic had its first major sales from Sonnie Badu's album "Soundz Of Afrika". Aftown went on to sell albums from top Ghanaian artists like Sarkodie, MzVee, Akan, M.anifest, Joe Mettle, EL, Stonebwoy, Okyeame Kwame, Adomaa, Teephlow.
