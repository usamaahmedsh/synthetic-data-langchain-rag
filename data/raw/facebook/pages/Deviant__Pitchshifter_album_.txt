Deviant is the fifth album by the British industrial metal band Pitchshifter, released in 2000. It was a follow-up to the commercially successful album www.pitchshifter.com, but was seen by the record label as a disappointment. Promotional videos by DOSE Productions were made for the tracks "Hidden Agenda" and "Dead Battery". The track "Everything's Fucked" was originally released as "Everything Sucks". Jello Biafra makes an appearance on the track "As Seen on TV". By March 2002, the album had sold 33,000 copies in the U.S., just over half the amount www.pitchshifter.com had sold at the same time.
Before Deviant was released, a promotional sampler CD was released under the name 'Deviant Sampler'.

== Album cover ==
Pitchshifter's album cover used a picture of a painting by Gee Vaucher, who did artwork for Crass and Carcass. The painting shows a cross between the Pope John Paul II and Queen Elizabeth II. The album cover was banned in Poland, due to some of the public's response and complaints deeming the image offensive and insulting to the Pope. The band and MCA Records apologized and changed the artwork.
