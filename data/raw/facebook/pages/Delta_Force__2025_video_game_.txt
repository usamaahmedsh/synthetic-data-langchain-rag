Delta Force, formerly Delta Force: Hawk Ops, is a free-to-play first-person tactical shooter video game developed and published by TiMi Studio Group for Windows PC, iOS and Android devices, while the home consoles launch arrived in August 2025. It is part of the computer FPS Delta Force series, previously developed and published by NovaLogic. The group also develops the game under its development division TiMi-J3, known for developing Call of Duty: Mobile.
Originally titled simply Delta Force, and then amended to Delta Force: Hawk Ops, on August 20, 2024, the game's title was reverted to just Delta Force. The game was officially launched on April 21, 2025, through mobile phones and PC and August 19, 2025, for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.


== Gameplay ==

Players assume the role of military operators with unique abilities on the battlefield in an unnamed conflict between factions GTI and Haavk. Set in present-day locations, these battles are extensive, with military vehicles such as tanks and helicopters available for players to control. Players can customize their vehicles,  weapons, and characters.
The multiplayer is free to play with optional micro-transactions, and developers have opted against pay-to-win elements, with a separate game currency for cosmetics (mostly with collaborations). Aside from Warfare, a mode where teams are allocated tickets to win a game, the game also features an extraction mode known as Hazard Operations. Player progression is largely shared across different platforms with some limitations.


=== Tactics ===
Operations mode is a loot and extract style game with several player teams battling for a limited amount of high value items, such as the "Heart of Africa" and the "Battle Tank Model", the proceeds of which allow players to purchase better equipment and/or upgrades to their base. Successful extraction requires coordination and decisive planning, as enemy operator special abilities make movement and positioning crucial to obtaining tactical advantage. It is generally favorable to have a Stinger in every 3 man team, as smoke screen provides an extremely versatile offensive and defensive tool to temporarily modify the map. It is also advised to warm up with your team for three rounds of Hotzone before dropping into an operation together to adapt to each others communication and play styles.


=== Plot ===
The game is set in 2035, where the government of a fictional North African country called Ahsarah sought to fix its energy crisis, partnering with an international corporation called Haavk. However as Haavk tightened its grip, tensions with a conservative nationalist military group called Ahsarah Guard rose and all out war broke. The Global Threat Initiative (GTI), an international paramilitary group which includes former Delta Force operatives, seek to foil Haavk's plans.


== Development and release ==


=== Black Hawk Down campaign ===
Inspired by the film Black Hawk Down (2001) by Ridley Scott and Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, the game features a single-player and cooperative mode as United States forces participating in the 1993 Somali conflict, with rights to Scott's footage and is to be closely based on the film. Tech demos of the campaign featured levels rendered in Unreal Engine 5, including the locations of the raid which led to the Battle of Mogadishu. A fully fledged campaign had not been previously seen in a TiMi-developed game.


=== Release ===
Delta Force open-beta released for PC on December 5, 2024. For iOS and Android, Delta Force launched on April 21, 2025. For PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, Delta Force launched on August 19, 2025.


== Reception ==
Delta Force received "mixed or average" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.
Justin Koreis from IGN felt that the game was competent and wrote that Delta Force was "both a good large-scale PvP shooter and a serviceable extraction shooter, even if neither half stands out". Rick Lane from Eurogamer also praised Warfare and Operations, describing them as "meticulously designed and undeniably entertaining", though he lamented that the game was not innovative and too conservative in its design. However, he strongly criticized the Black Hawk Down campaign, calling it "atrocious" and adding that it was nearly impossible to play the campaign alone.
