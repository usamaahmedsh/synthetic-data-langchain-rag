The Lamborghini Gallardo (; Spanish: [ɡaˈʎaɾðo]) is a sports car built by the Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini from 2003 to 2013. It is Lamborghini's second car released under parent company Audi, and the best-selling model at the time with 14,022 built throughout its production run. Named after a famous breed of fighting bull, the V10 powered Gallardo has been Lamborghini's sales leader and stable-mate to a succession of V12 flagship models—first to the Murciélago (4,099 built between 2001 and 2010), then to the Aventador, being the first entry-level Lamborghini in one-and-half decades. On 25 November 2013, the last Gallardo was rolled off the production line. The Gallardo was replaced by the Huracán in 2014.


== Overview ==

After Megatech purchased Automobili Lamborghini S.P.A in 1994, Italdesign Giugiaro was hired to design concept cars to replace their existing cars. One of the concepts built by them was the Lamborghini Calà, built to replace the Lamborghini Jalpa and was displayed at the 1995 Geneva Motor Show.
After the Volkswagen Group took hold of the company in 1998, the Lamborghini Gallardo was built on the basis of the Calà and had many features absorbed from the concept car such as the exterior design and the traditional V10 engine.
The car name is taken from the 18th century Spanish bullfighting breeder Francisco Gallardo. It means "gallant".

== Gallardo (2003–2008) ==


=== Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe ===

The original Gallardo was powered with an even firing 4,961 cc (5.0 L) 90 degree V10 engine generating a maximum power output of 500 PS (368 kW; 493 hp) at 7500 rpm and 510 N⋅m (376 lb⋅ft) of torque at 4500 RPM. The Gallardo was offered with two choices of transmission; a conventional (H-pattern) six-speed manual transmission, and a six-speed electro-hydraulically actuated single-clutch automated manual transmission that Lamborghini called "E-gear". Both gearboxes were built by Graziano Trasmissioni. The "E-gear" transmission provides gear changes more quickly than could be achieved through a manual shift. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode via the gear selector located in place of the gear shift lever. The vehicle was designed by Luc Donckerwolke and was based on the 1995 Calà prototype designed by Italdesign Giugiaro.


==== 2005 Coupé update ====
For the 2006 model year (launched in late 2005), Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter during city driving), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20 PS to a maximum of 520 PS (382 kW; 513 hp), and the biggest change was overall lower gearing ratios, especially in 1st to 5th gear. These changes gave the car a much better performance than the original and were also included in the limited edition Gallardo SE.


=== Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder ===

The convertible variant of the Gallardo, called the Gallardo Spyder, was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006. It was considered by the company to be an entirely new model, with the engine having a power output of 520 PS (382 kW; 513 hp) and a low-ratio six-speed manual transmission. The Spyder has a retractable soft-top.


=== Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera ===

At the 2007 Geneva Auto Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Gallardo Superleggera. The name paid tribute to the construction style of the first Lamborghini production model, the 350 GT, designed and built by Carrozzeria Touring and its emphasis on weight reduction. The Superleggera is lighter than the base model by 100 kg (220 lb) due to the use of carbon fiber panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium wheel nuts and carbon fibre sports seats. The engine power was uprated by 10 PS (7 kW; 10 hp) courtesy of an improved intake, exhaust and ECU for a total power output of 530 PS (390 kW; 523 hp). The 6-speed E-Gear transmission was standard on US spec models with the 6-speed manual transmission offered as a no cost option. Production of the Superleggera was limited to 618 units worldwide.


==== Recall ====
Lamborghini recalled about 1,500 Gallardo Coupé and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, because of the possibility of power steering fluid leaking and the risk of fire. The cars were built from May 2003 through April 2008.

=== Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4 ===

Featuring "Iniezione Diretta Stratificata" direct fuel injection system to improve efficiency; fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have been reduced by 18% despite the increase in performance. The car was redesigned, inspired by the Murciélago LP 640 and its derivative model the Reventón.
The new engine, 40 PS (29 kW; 39 hp) more powerful than in the previous car, comes with two transmission choices: a 6-speed manual or 6-speed E-gear, the latter of which was revised to offer a Corsa mode which makes 40% quicker shifts than before and decreases traction control restrictions, a Thrust Mode launch control system was also added. Accompanied with a 20 kg (44 lb) weight reduction. All the improvements add up to a claimed performance of 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.7 seconds, 0–200 km/h (124 mph) of 11.8 and a top speed of 325 km/h (202 mph).

=== Lamborghini Concept S ===

The Lamborghini Concept S is a concept car based on the Gallardo, featuring a speedster (Barchetta) body designed by Luc Donckerwolke. It was built in 2005 and was first shown at that year's Geneva Motor Show. The Concept S was intended to be a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past. Utilizing a 'saute-vent' (French for 'change wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5.0 L V10 engine, giving the car a distinctly futuristic look along with increasing aerodynamic flow. The rear-view mirror is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or to retract it into the dashboard when not needed. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs. Lamborghini was rumored to be building 100 examples for customers but decided to keep it as a styling exercise. Only 2 cars were produced: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach was up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby's Manhattan event "Driven by Disruption". It was expected to sell for US$2.4 to 3 million, but failed to sell. In 2023 one of the two prototypes arrived in a Miami car dealer named CURATED.

=== End of production ===
The last Lamborghini vehicle with a manual transmission was reported to be a Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-2 50° Anniversario by Popular Mechanics.
On 25 November 2013, the last Lamborghini Gallardo, an LP 570-4 Spyder Performante with Rosso Mars (red) body colour, was built at the Sant'Agata Bolognese factory, to be received by a private collector in the upcoming weeks. A total of 14,022 units of the Lamborghini Gallardo had been built during its 10-year product cycle.


== Motorsports ==


=== FIA GT3 Championship ===

In 2007, the Gallardo was entered in the FIA GT3 Championship, with the Gallardo GT3, built by German motorsport specialists Reiter Engineering, who previously manufactured the Murciélago R-GT and the Diablo GTR Super Trophy race cars. All the extra aerodynamic components were bolt-on parts, conforming with cost-effective regulations that meant the finished car had to closely resemble its road-going counterpart. Brembo racing brakes and OZ Racing wheels were also added. It was converted to rear-wheel drive, other than when racing in the one-make Lamborghini Super Trofeo. The engine generated a maximum power output of 520 PS (382 kW; 513 hp) at 7,800 rpm and 510 N⋅m (376 lb⋅ft) of torque at 4,500 RPM.


=== ADAC GT Masters ===
The inaugural season of ADAC GT Masters was held in 2007 and the championship was won by the Lamborghini Gallardo LP520 GT3 driven by Christopher Haase, Gianni Morbidelli and Jos Menten. The german racing team, Reiter Engineering won the drivers' championship with 214 points, and the team championship with 332 points. They won six of the ten races that season, including the season finale at Hockenheim.
Reiter Engineering would also win the 2010 ADAC GT Masters season with Peter Kox and Albert von Thurn und Taxis. They drove a Lamborghini Gallardo LP560 GT3 for the Reiter Engineering team. The pair won five races and finished on the podium in ten of the fourteen races. They finished with 147 points, 18 points ahead of the second-placed team.


=== Super GT ===

In 2007, the Gallardo was entered by Japan Lamborghini Owners Club (JLOC) to the GT300 class of the Japanese Super GT Championship, the car had to conform to rather different regulations. The engine could only have a power output of 300 PS (221 kW; 296 hp) and the car must be rear-wheel-drive. The power was limited by air restrictions placed in the engine bay. The gearbox is a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the Super GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. It took a while to be competitive, only being consistently at the top during the 2009 season.


=== Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo ===

In May 2009 Lamborghini introduced what it calls the 'Fastest one-make series in the world', featuring the Gallardo LP 560-4 Super Trofeo, a race-prepared version of the newer Gallardo LP 560-4. The series supported European race series such as Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), FIA GT Series and the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC), featuring 18 races overall and having a 30-car grid consisting of privateer teams as well as Lamborghini dealer teams and one factory team featuring guest drivers. The Super Trofeo race car was based on the Gallardo LP 560-4 sports car, but with a reworked chassis, dramatic bodywork/aerodynamics and a direct injection odd firing V10 engine rated at 570 PS (419 kW; 562 hp) with a higher compression ratio of 12.5:1, variable valve timing all prepared by the Reiter Engineering group. The car has dry weight of 1,300 kg (2,866 lb). E-gear transmission was standard. The race car and parts package cost €200,000 (US$284,300) plus tax, available via Lamborghini dealerships, with support and parts sales trackside.


=== Reiter Extenso ===

The final motorsport iteration of the Gallardo was created externally by Lamborghini's long time motorsport partner Reiter Engineering. Introduced in 2014, the Gallardo Reiter Extenso R-EX extended the racing life of the Gallardo beyond the introduction of its successor, the Lamborghini Huracán GT3.


=== American Le Mans Series ===
West Racing campaigned an LP 560 GT in the GT class of the American Le Mans Series for certain races of the 2011 season. However, as of July 2011, the team announced that they were developing a new car and by implication would no longer race the LP 560.


=== Speed World Challenge ===
DP7 Racing has currently entered two Gallardos in the Speed World Challenge GT Series, driven by Dan Pastorini and Chip Herr.


== Gas tank issues ==
The Gallardo features a unique gas port located on the top of the car, and is designed in a way that is incompatible with the anti-vapor sheath that most American gas stations use as a safety feature. This design issue causes gas pumps to fail to engage, or disengage in the middle of the fill process. Lamborghini owners have resorted to using mechanical hacks, such as pulling back the sheath with their fingers, or employing a plastic ring fitted over the port to force the sheath backwards.
