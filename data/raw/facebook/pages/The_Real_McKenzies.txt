The Real McKenzies is a Canadian Celtic punk band founded in 1992 and based in Vancouver, British Columbia. They are considered the founders of the Canadian Celtic punk movement, and were one of the first Celtic punk bands, albeit 10 years after The Pogues. Founding member Paul McKenzie has been the only continuous member of the band since its inception. 
In addition to writing and performing original music, Real McKenzies perform traditional Scottish songs, and their take on traditional Scottish poetry, giving them a new punk-influenced sound. The band has shared stages with several other bands and artists, including Rancid, Shane MacGowan, NOFX, Flogging Molly, The Misfits, Metallica, the Specials, and Voodoo Glow Skulls.


== History ==
The band released their debut album, "the Real McKenzies" in 1995, a cheeky collection of short punky originals, interspersed among celtic classics, & deeply tongue-in-cheek, punk-infused covers like "My Bonny", "Pliers" (Jimi Hendrix's "Fire"), "Kilt" (Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias's "Kill"), and "Outta Scotch" (the Pointed Sticks's "Outta Luck"). 
Their 1998 follow up Clash of the Tartans popularized Scottish-Canadian punk-rock, with solid singles "Thistle Boy", "Pagan Holiday", "Mainland", "Kings O' Glasgow", & the old celtic classic "Wild Mountain Thyme". Frontman Paul McKenzie claims as many as 100 different musicians have performed as members of the band, including (now-deceased) bassist Rich "Rock" Priske (Matthew Good Band, Bif Naked; drummer Glenn "McKruger" Kruger (Bloody Chicletts, the Paperboys, Mudgirl, Carly Rae Jepsen); & piper Alan "Raven" MacLeod, of the pioneering '70s Scottish folk band The Tannahill Weavers, and 90s duo Bourne and MacLeod. In 2012, they delved deeper into covering songs from popular Canadian singer-songwriter Stan Rogers with their version of "Barrett's Privateers" appearing on their album Westwinds.
McKenzie said in 2014 that he "fired all the Americans" in the band, and returned to a full Canadian lineup. Despite that claim, Aspy Luison is from Cambre, Galicia, Spain.
In September 2014 the band announced they would be recording their next album for Fat Wreck Chords at Motor Studio in San Francisco. Michael "Fat Mike" Burkett will be producing the album.
On April 7, 2015, Fat Wreck Chords released The Real McKenzies' 11th album, Rats in the Burlap.
The band covered Stan Rogers a second time for their 2017 album Two Devils Will Talk with the song "Northwest Passage".
On March 10, 2022, it was announced that former War Baby drummer Kirby J. Fisher had joined the band.
