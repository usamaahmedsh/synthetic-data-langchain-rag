Un gars, une fille (French pronunciation: [œ̃ ɡɑ yn fij], A Guy, A Girl) is a Canadian comedy television series created by and starring Guy A. Lepage and broadcast on Radio-Canada, as well as the title of its French adaptation on France 2. It was one of the most successful television shows in the province of Quebec, with a concept exported to more than thirty markets around the world. It was the first French-language Canadian television programme to be adapted in the United States.
The show spawned several international versions, most notably a French TV series of the same name, which characters appeared in a 1999 episode of the original series, "À Paris".


== Overview ==
A typical episode features several vignettes of the everyday life of a couple, with the camera mostly centred on them. Often other characters are cropped, giving the programme its unique visual style. The couple receives friends for supper, go to the convenience store, or leave on a trip, and sometimes get on each other's nerves. Their quirks, and loving bickering, provide much of the program's humour. The graphic design style associated with the original Un gars, une fille, which consists of a palette of pastel blue and pink, and rough lines and scribbles, as well as a logo with simulated printing mistakes and smears, has been imitated by most of the other versions, with the notable exception of the American version. The character names are often those of the actors, as in the first version.
The concept of Un gars, une fille began in the 1990s as a series of short segments featured on Besoin d'amour, a TQS network daily talk-show, hosted by Guy A. Lepage that ran from 1995 to 1996. Lepage, a veteran of the renowned comedy troupe Rock et Belles Oreilles (RBO), played one half of the couple along with Sylvie Léonard. The duo reprised their roles in what became  Un gars une fille in 1997, a successful weekly 26-minute programme which spawned many adaptations. It was celebrated numerous times at awards presentations, notably winning the Gémeaux, Félix, and MetroStar Awards. It was also nominated twice at the American Emmy Awards. Produced by Avanti Ciné Vidéo, the show aired from 1997 to 2003 in its initial run, and continued in reruns afterward. 130 episodes were produced, which included about 4,000 scenes. The scriptwriting team included RBO members André Ducharme and Bruno Landry, as well as Sylvie Léonard herself. Yves P. Pelletier, also from RBO, has been featured onscreen. After the series concluded in 2003, Lepage went on to produce and host the hugely successful Tout le monde en parle, adapted from the eponymous French hit talk-show.

A standard episode is presented in three acts, each of which is split into five to seven scenes. Flashy pastel blue and pink graphics with squiggly lines follow punchlines and mark transitions, coupled with an upbeat percussive tune, and often a spoken Voice-over phrase summing up the previous segment. Appropriately, the show's publicity, and early video release covers, are often recognisable by the presence of those pastel blue and pink colours and askew lines, mimicking the graphics that separate the programme's scenes; traditionally, the colour blue is associated with boys and pink with girls.
The two main characters, "Guy et Sylvie", are named after the actors who play them. Guy likes to tease Sylvie on a variety of subjects and hates her mother. His father is remarried to a young, good-looking stripper, Mélanie, played by Mahée Paiement, and had a child with her. The attention the child receives makes Guy jealous, his father having spent little time with him when he was a child. Unlike Guy, Sylvie dreams of having a baby. She is jealous of Geneviève, Guy's sexy, and promiscuous, office colleague with whom he had a one-time affair years ago. She is also obsessed with cleanliness and resents Guy for being untidy. A curious running gag from the show involves Guy surprising Sylvie by grabbing her breasts from behind while shouting "Road Runner!", followed by the cartoon character's emblematic honking "beeb beeb" sound. While she ostensibly loves it, she pretended the exact opposite when it was obliquely brought up by Guy in front of her mother. This joke was developed on the set by the two actors. The last season saw notable developments: a marriage, and a trip to Vietnam to adopt a little girl.

=== Canada (English version) ===
An English Canadian adaptation was created by the producer of the original show, Luc Wiseman of Avanti Ciné-Vidéo television production company. The main English Canadian networks CBC, CTV, and Global Television were not interested in the concept. Wiseman stated: "They were saying that it was not for the Canadian market, that it was too audacious". With the title A Guy & A Girl, it ended up airing on Women's Television Network (WTN), (now known as the W Network), a cable television specialty channel, and lasted for two seasons. Jeff Clarke played Mike, and Katherine Ashby was Susy; together they received a Gemini Award nomination for Ensemble Performance in a Comedy Program or Series at the 18th Gemini Awards in 2003.

=== United States ===
Entitled Lovebites, the American version began broadcasting on September 13, 2006, with comedian Paul Reiser as executive producer and writer. It was co-produced by Stuart McLean (founder of Content & Company) at JWT, the world's fourth largest advertising agency. While the original format was 26 minutes, the American version consisted of a season of 82 episodes of two and a half minutes each (which was not part of the original contract, see below). 65 should be seen on television while 17 will be available for computers and cell phones. It aired on the TBS cable television network on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays sometime in the slot between 11:00 pm and midnight, and on Friday morning in the slot between 9:00 am and 10:00 am. Lovebites stars David Julian Hirsh (a native of Montreal, Quebec, seen in CSI: NY and Naked Josh) and Lauren Bittner (seen in Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Third Watch). The characters, called Max and Katie, are about 25 years old, younger than the original Guy and Sylvie. Another notable difference with the original version is that the couple in Lovebites breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the camera.
Lovebites was the first time a Québécer TV concept was adapted for an American audience (Louis 19, King of the Airwaves (Louis 19, le roi des ondes), a movie, had already been remade as EdTV). Reiser is said to have been captivated by the series when it was presented to him by Michel Rodrigue, president of Distraction Formats, the Montreal-based international distribution company for Un gars, une fille. Rodrigue said: "The selling process has been long and complicated. It has been a very long time that we have been working on it". Creator Guy A. Lepage said that he thought the chemistry worked well between the two main actors. Nevertheless, he has stated his disappointment with the finished product, giving it a "2 out of 10". In his opinion, the problem did not lie with the acting, but with the length of the show (two and a half minutes long, as mentioned above), the sponsor, the broadcasting and the assembling. He summed it up by saying: "It's media concentration to the power of 1,000, like a super big TVA". (TVA is part of Pierre Karl Péladeau's Quebecor media conglomerate.) Sunsilk, a shampoo brand of Unilever's, was the main sponsor of Lovebites. As of 2006, Canadian and American producers are still caught up in a legal dispute, notably about the aforementioned short length. The initial contract planned a guaranteed minimum of seven minutes per episode.


=== Others ===
The concept of Un gars, une fille was also sold to producers in: Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Bosnia, Cuba, Denmark, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Latvia, Lebanon (Patricia Nammour - Issam Breidy), Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and many others, totaling more than thirty countries. Not all of these rights sales have resulted in a programme being produced.
