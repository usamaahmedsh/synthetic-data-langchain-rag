== History ==
TVPlayer was launched as an Android and Apple iOS smartphone app on 19 December 2013. Compatible apps for Android tablet computers and the Apple iPad were released on 30 January 2014. As of January 2017, the applications had been downloaded 2.5 million times and had over one million active viewers.
On 30 January 2017, TVPlayer announced it had launched compatibility for all Windows 10 devices.
On 26 November 2020, TVPlayer's licensing agreement with Discovery expired. As a result, Discovery, Investigation Discovery, TLC and Discovery Home & Health were no longer available on TVPlayer's Premium service and Quest, Quest Red, Really, DMAX, Food Network and HGTV were removed from the free service.
In September 2025, the service went offline.
