== Gameplay ==

112 Operator is a strategy simulation video game in which players assume the role of an operator receiving emergency calls, and managing resources to send first responders. Gameplay is undertaken on a map of territory, where throughout the day the player will receive calls of incidents. Players must send specific teams in available vehicles to respond, with the appropriateness of the responder and vehicle depending on the call. Some calls can handled unsuccessfully, such as the players failing to dispatch services in time, or providing the wrong response to the emergency. As players complete calls, they will expand the number of districts under their control and receive more calls, and earn money which they can use to buy new vehicles and hire new personnel. The game features three difficulty modes, and scenarios based on real-world disasters such as the 2020 California wildfires.
