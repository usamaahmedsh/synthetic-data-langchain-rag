The reason for the take down was the unauthorised script. The whole fiasco prompted the making of ClipBucket in a whopping 30-day time span. The basic aim behind the coming into being of ClipBucket was to own a script that would help in bringing back Tune.pk. Tune.pk was launched again in 2008, but the site could not take off due to the inexperience of the team. Then again, in 2009, the site was relaunched but couldn't work because of lack of technical resource.
