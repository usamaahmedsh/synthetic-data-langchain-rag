== History ==


=== Early years and Black Earth (1995–1997) ===
Arch Enemy was formed in 1995 by Michael Amott, and the debut album Black Earth was recorded during nine days in Studio Fredman and released by the now defunct Wrong Again Records in 1996.


=== Stigmata, Burning Bridges, and Gossow (1998–2000) ===

After the release of Black Earth the band switched labels, signing a contract with Century Media. In 1998 Arch Enemy released Stigmata, for which bassist Martin Bengtsson and drummer Peter Wildoer joined the band. The album gained a wider audience and popularity in Europe and America. This was also the first Arch Enemy album to be released worldwide.
In 1999, Sharlee D'Angelo (ex-King Diamond, ex-Mercyful Fate) assumed the role of Arch Enemy's bassist, and Daniel Erlandsson (Eucharist, ex-Carcass) was again recruited as the drummer. Burning Bridges was released, and was followed by the live album Burning Japan Live 1999. During the touring-cycle for Burning Bridges, D'Angelo was temporarily replaced twice; first by Dick Lövgren (Meshuggah, ex-Armageddon) and then by Roger Nilsson (ex-Spiritual Beggars, Firebird, the Quill).
In November 2000, vocalist Johan Liiva left and was replaced by German death metal vocalist Angela Gossow.


=== Wages of Sin and Anthems of Rebellion (2001–2004) ===
The first album with songs featuring Gossow was Wages of Sin, released in 2001. In December of the same year, Arch Enemy took part in the "Japan's Beast Feast 2002" concert, playing alongside Slayer and Motörhead.
Anthems of Rebellion was released in 2003 and brought some innovations, such as the use of a second voice singing in harmony; such as in the "End of the Line" and "Dehumanization" tracks. In November of the following year, the band released the EP Dead Eyes See No Future, which featured live recordings, along with covers of Manowar, Megadeth and Carcass songs. In June 2004, the band embarked upon yet another Japan tour.


=== Doomsday Machine (2004–2006) ===
In June 2005, Arch Enemy finished the recording for their sixth album, Doomsday Machine. In July 2005, guitarist Christopher Amott left the band in order to focus on his personal life. He was temporarily replaced by guitarist Gus G. (ex-Ozzy Osbourne, Firewind) and then by Fredrik Åkesson (Opeth, ex-Talisman) in September 2005. Christopher returned on a permanent basis in March 2007, shortly before the band entered the studio to begin recording their new album with producer Fredrik Nordström (who had previously worked with the band on their first four albums). Åkesson went on to become Opeth's new lead guitarist in May 2007.


=== Rise of the Tyrant (2007–2008) ===

Arch Enemy's seventh album, entitled Rise of the Tyrant was released on 24 September 2007 in Europe and 25 September 2007 in the United States. Rise of the Tyrant debuted at number 84 on the Billboard 200 chart. This surpassed the Doomsday Machine chart entry, making it the band's highest charting effort to date. Gossow said the new album has more emotion and less double vocals, as well as less vocal processing, yielding a more "raw" presentation.
Arch Enemy played the Bloodstock Open Air Festival in August 2007, between Sabbat and In Flames. They then performed on the Black Crusade tour at the end of 2007 with Machine Head, Trivium, DragonForce and Shadows Fall.
On 8 March 2008 Arch Enemy filmed a live show in Tokyo, Japan for the live DVD Tyrants of the Rising Sun. Arch Enemy also co-headlined the "Defenders of the Faith" tour in April 2008 with Opeth, while DevilDriver and 3 Inches of Blood opened for them. They then headlined the "Tyranny and Bloodshred" tour in May 2008 with Dark Tranquillity, Divine Heresy, and Firewind as supporting acts.


=== The Root of All Evil (2009–2010) ===
A compilation album titled The Root of All Evil was released on 28 September 2009 in Europe, 30 September in Japan, and 6 October in the United States. The Root of All Evil features twelve re-recorded songs spanning the band's career before Gossow joined as vocalist, with some material pre-dating D'Angelo as their bassist. In the first half of 2009, the band toured Europe and South America, and then played at the annual "Dubai Desert Rock Festival" alongside Opeth, Chimaira, and Motörhead. Following the release of The Root of All Evil on 28 September 2009, the band embarked on an Asian and Australian tour, which included their first visit to New Zealand. The tour started at the "Loud Park festival" in Japan on 17 October supplementing other acts including Megadeth, Judas Priest, Slayer, Anthrax, Rob Zombie and Children of Bodom. They also toured in South Korea on 25 October headlining at the Melon AX Hall in Seoul.

Gossow did confirm that she would remain Arch Enemy's business manager and would be "passing the torch to the super talented Alissa White-Gluz, whom I've known as a dear friend and a superb vocalist for many years. I always thought she deserved a chance to shine – and now she's getting it. Just like I got that chance back in 2001."
White-Gluz also released a statement saying: "I am very honored and happy to announce a new chapter in my life and musical career. Wages of Sin was the first metal album I ever bought, and it was love at first listen. It is not often that you get a phone call from your favorite band asking you to join! I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work with such amazingly talented musicians whom I also consider great friends. I look forward to being able to write and perform at a whole new level now with Arch Enemy! Music is forever, metal is limitless and this is only the beginning!"

== Musical style ==
Arch Enemy's musical style has been classified as melodic death metal. AllMusic critic Steve Huey describes the band's sound as a "blend of progressive and death metal influences." Earlier albums, such as Burning Bridges, while still classified as melodic death metal, are more centered around classic death metal. Invisible Oranges described the band's sound as "sort of a watered-down version" of  Carcass's 1993 album Heartwork. They were heavy influenced by heavy metal bands such as Megadeth, Scorpions, UFO, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Death, Morbid Angel and Obituary.
