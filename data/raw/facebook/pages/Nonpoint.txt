== History ==


=== Early years (1997–2004) ===
During the early 1990s, drummer Robb Rivera formed a band named Nonpoint Factor. The band released various demos and its lineup changed numerous times, with Rivera as the only constant member. By 1997, the band's name was shortened to simply "Nonpoint", and the lineup was restructured with Rivera on drums, Elias Soriano on vocals, Ken MacMillan on bass, and Andrew Goldman on guitar. The name Nonpoint came from a Believer song named "Nonpoint". Soriano recalls: "I dug the name so I started using it around that time. It has no real meaning to us. It has something to do with pollution, but to us it just sounded cool." The band self-released their first independent album, Separate Yourself, in late 1997. Another independent album, Struggle, was released on May 18, 1999, on the now-defunct Jugular Records.
The band released their debut major label album Statement on October 10, 2000, via MCA Records. To promote the album, as well as the band on a nationwide scale, Nonpoint toured with such artists as Hed PE, Mudvayne, Fuel, Taproot, and Drowning Pool, with their main tour appearing on the United States leg of the 2001 Ozzfest tour. A year after its release, the album entered the Billboard 200 charts, where it peaked at No. 166. The first single from the album, "What a Day", peaked at No. 24 on the Mainstream Rock charts.
Nonpoint's second album Development was released on June 25, 2002. The album entered the Billboard charts at No. 52, with the first single released from the album, "Your Signs", peaking at No. 36 on the Mainstream Rock charts.  Nonpoint completed a successful second appearance at Ozzfest, during the Donington Park leg of the European tour. Other tours included Sevendust on the first Locobazooka tour, dates with Filter, Sunset Black, and Papa Roach. A second single, "Circles", was featured in NASCAR Thunder 2003, as well as the soundtrack for Hot Wheels AcceleRacers.
Two years after the release of Development, Nonpoint released their third major album Recoil on August 3, 2004, via their new label Lava Records. The album entered the Billboard charts at No. 115. The album's first single, "The Truth", peaked at No. 22 on the Mainstream Rock charts. Another single, "Rabia" was later released.


=== Middle years (2005–2009) ===
After departing from Lava Records, Nonpoint signed with independent label Bieler Bros. Records. The label's co-owner, Jason Bieler, produced the band's previous three albums. Nonpoint re-emerged with their fourth major album To the Pain on November 8, 2005. The album entered the Billboard charts at No. 147, with approximately 9,000 copies sold during its first week of release. The single, "Bullet with a Name", peaked at No. 22 on the Mainstream Rock charts and was featured on the game WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 and 2007 film The Condemned. The album's second single, "Alive and Kicking", peaked at No. 25. The song was also featured on the game WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007. "In the Air Tonight", which was previously featured on the Recoil album, was the theme song for the Miami Vice movie. It made a belated appearance on the Mainstream Rock charts, peaking at No. 34. Beginning in late 2005, Nonpoint toured extensively with Sevendust for three months, later concluding the tour in New Hampshire. Nonpoint toured on the third annual Music as a Weapon Tour with Disturbed, Stone Sour and Flyleaf. The band also did tours with Sevendust and Buckcherry.

== Musical style and influences ==
Nonpoint have been described as nu metal, alternative metal, hard rock, groove metal, and rap metal. Vocalist Elias Soriano views Nonpoint both as a metal band and a rock band, elaborating, "We don't try to pigeonhole ourselves."
Originally playing an aggressive style, Nonpoint moved to more melodic sounds with their 2002 album Development, due to pressure from their record label MCA. The 2004 album Recoil marked a return to the band's heavier roots. In a 2000 interview, Soriano reflected on the band's musical influences, stating "We all have a lot of separate influences. My drummer comes from a more metal/hardcore background. My bass player is from the straight edge hardcore, Earth Crisis, Hatebreed, stuff like that. My guitar player is really into Stevie Ray Vaughan and blues and a lot of industrial stuff like Nine Inch Nails. Me personally, I grew up on a lot of R&B, a lot of rap. I'm into that smooth, soulful sound." The band's self-titled album "[added] a dash of post-grunge to the mix," according to AllMusic.
Nonpoint frequently use frog symbolism (specifically that of the coquí, a group of several species native to Puerto Rico) on their album covers, as well as in vocal samples in Development.
