Liberators is played by recruiting different commanders and deploying their squads in formations against enemies.  These formations are automatically controlled, so the player's role is to make sure that they've deployed the best Commanders in their army.  Based on World War II, Liberators features key historical commanders such as Eisenhower, Churchill, and Patton who can be recruited into your army, along with dozens more.  Through gaining EXP and getting the best equipment, players level up their commanders and stay competitive in both the game's main storyline and various different PVP style matches.
