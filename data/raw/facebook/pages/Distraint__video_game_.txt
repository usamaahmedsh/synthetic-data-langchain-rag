Distraint is an indie psychological horror game developed and published by Jesse Makkonen in 2015. In November 2018, the game received an update called Distraint: Deluxe Edition.


== Plot and gameplay ==
The plot revolves around a young man named Price working as a distraint collector for a corporation McDade, Bruton & Moore. Throughout the game, Price is tasked with evicting the three residents who are no longer able to pay their housing bills. Price struggles with an internal conflict between "humanity" and "money", and the further he progresses with his tasks, the more horror-like visions he encounters. 


== Reception ==
The PC version of the game has received "generally favorable reviews" on the review aggregator website Metacritic, while its Nintendo Switch version has received "mixed or average" reviews. Adventure Gamers rated it as "decent" (3/5) and described as "a modest but oddly compelling adventure steeped in perpetual darkness". The Deluxe Edition version of the game after its release for Nintendo Switch in 2019 received 7/10 on Pure Nintendo: Kaelin Daugherty described it as a "good psychological thriller" and "short, sad game", but expressed disappointment with the ending, saying that the game "ends way too soon."


== Sequel ==
On 13 November 2018, Makkonen released the sequel for the game, Distraint 2. The sequel, described as about "restoring hope and finding your purpose", is set directly after the ending of the first game.
