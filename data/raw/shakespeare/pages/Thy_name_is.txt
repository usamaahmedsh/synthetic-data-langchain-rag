"______, thy name is ______" is a snowclone used to indicate the completeness with which something or somebody (indicated by the second part) embodies a particular quality (indicated by the first part), usually a negative one.


== History ==
In most instances, the usage is an allusion to the Shakespearean play Hamlet (I, ii, 146).  In this work, the title character is chastised by his uncle (and new stepfather), Claudius, for grieving his father so much, calling it unmanly.  In his resultant soliloquy, Hamlet denounces his mother's swift remarriage with the statement, "Frailty, thy name is woman."  He thus describes all of womankind as frail and weak in character.  The phrase is recognized as one of the "memorable expressions"  from the play to become "proverbial".
In the book Idiom Structure in English by Adam Makkai, the author asserts that the phrase is included among English idioms that are expressed in a "standard format" and whose usage "signals to the hearer that he is using an authority in underscoring his own opinion."  Researchers Andrew Littlejohn and Sandhya Rao Mehta acknowledged that the famous quote rendered not only a discursive use, but a constructional one as well, noting that "the structure itself can be used as a salient, but neutral equation formula...'noun thy name is noun.'"
