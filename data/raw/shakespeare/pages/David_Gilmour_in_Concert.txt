David Gilmour in Concert is a DVD of  Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour's solo concert that took place at the Royal Festival Hall, London in June 2001, as part of the Robert Wyatt-curated Meltdown festival. It also features footage filmed during three concerts at the same venue in January 2002. The track selection includes several Pink Floyd songs, in addition to Gilmour's solo works. Guest appearances are made by Floyd colleague Richard Wright, as well as Robert Wyatt and Bob Geldof. It includes the first performance of "Smile", a track that would appear almost five years later on Gilmour's third solo album, On an Island. Gilmour also plays two Syd Barrett songs.
Also included is "Je crois entendre encore" ("I still believe I hear") – an aria from Georges Bizet's opera Les pêcheurs de perles (The Pearl Fishers) – with a libretto by Eugène Cormon and Michel Carré. Sung by Gilmour in the original French. "I remember my wife Polly's face going red when I tried singing it," he recalled, "and my face literally going into a cold sweat – 'Do I dare try this?' But once the choir came up here [Gilmour's studio] and ran through it with me, that gave me a huge amount of confidence."

== Quotes ==
I can show you places where the nerves are there. At the beginning of 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond', there's a closeup of me doing a vibrato on the acoustic guitar which is more than I'd ever intended. That was due to trembling. It wasn't as under control as one would like it to be.
How did you go about choosing the material for the shows?
I went through the entire Pink Floyd catalogue, and I picked the tunes I liked. Then, after I figured out which ones would work with the instrumentation I had in mind, I spent about three months fiddling around in my home studio mocking up the arrangements.
