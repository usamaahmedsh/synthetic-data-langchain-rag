Abrikosov (Russian: Абрикосов; masculine) or Abrikosova (Russian: Абрикосова; feminine) is a Russian surname. It derives from the Russian word "абрикос" (abrikos), meaning apricot and is associated with the Abrikosov family of merchants. The line of Abrikosovs began with the Penza peasant Stepan Nikolayev, who migrated to Moscow in 1802 and later opened a confectionery plant there. As he started his business with importing and selling fruit (including apricots), he petitioned, and in 1814 was allowed, to change his name to Semyon Abrikosov.
