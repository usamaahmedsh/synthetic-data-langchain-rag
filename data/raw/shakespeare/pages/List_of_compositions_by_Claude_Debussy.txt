This is a list of compositions by Claude Debussy categorized by genre, and sorted within each genre by "L²" number, according to the 2001 revised catalogue by musicologist François Lesure, which is generally in chronological order of composition date. "L¹" numbers are also given from Lesure's original 1977 catalogue.
(The "L¹" and "L²" headers are clickable and doing so will sort the entire list by L¹ or L² number. Clicking that header again will reverse the order; to return to the genre category order, reload the webpage.)
