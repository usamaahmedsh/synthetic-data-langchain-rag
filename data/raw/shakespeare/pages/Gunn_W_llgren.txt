Gunn Wållgren (born Gunnel Margaret Haraldsdotter Wållgren; [vɔlɡreːn]; (16 November 1913 – 4 June 1983) was a Swedish stage and film actress. She is best remembered for her role in Ingmar Bergman's film Fanny and Alexander.


== Personal life ==
Gunn Wållgren was born in Gothenburg on 16 November 1913. In her teenage years, she began performing with a local children's theater group. Her father did not support her aspirations, and in an attempt to distract her, he sent her overseas on a trip to Switzerland. Gunn persisted in her ambition to pursue a career in acting. She secretly applied for the Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school in Stockholm in 1934 and was admitted. One of her teachers was Hilda Borgström, the famous Swedish film and stage actor.
In 1941, Wållgren married Hampe Faustman (born Erik Stellan Chatham), an actor and film director and they had two daughters, Susanne and Elaine. They divorced in 1948. She later married Per-Axel Branner, a stage director, in 1954 and they were together until his death in 1975.
