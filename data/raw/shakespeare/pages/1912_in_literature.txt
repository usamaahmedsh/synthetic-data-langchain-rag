== Events ==

January 5 (December 23, 1911 O.S.) – Konstantin Stanislavski and Edward Gordon Craig's seminal symbolist Moscow Art Theater production of Hamlet opens.
January 21 – Joseph Conrad achieves his first popular success as the New York Herald begins serializing his novel Chance. He broke off with it in 1906, but sold the rights to the unfinished work in June 1911. Conrad continues to work on the book, while the first chapters appear weekly in the Herald. He completes it on March 26.
March 3 – Frieda Weekley meets D. H. Lawrence in Nottingham.
April 14–15 – The ocean liner RMS Titanic strikes an iceberg and sinks on her maiden voyage from the United Kingdom to the United States. American mystery writer Jacques Futrelle, English journalist and publisher William Thomas Stead and American bibliophile Harry Elkins Widener are among over 1500 dead. A copy of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam in a jeweled binding by Sangorski & Sutcliffe (1911) is also lost. The event leads to a flood of poems, including Thomas Hardy's "The Convergence of the Twain".
May – Following the death of Lie Kim Hok from typhus in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, aged 58, Lauw Giok Lan takes on the work of completing his translations from the Dutch of Hugo Hartmann's Dolores, de Verkochte Vrouw into Sundanese as Prampoean jang Terdjoewal and of Geneviève de Vadans as De Juffrouw van Gezelschap.
June – Under the name I. G. Ofir, the Romanian poet Benjamin Fondane makes his publishing debut in the Iași magazine Floare Albastră, put out by A. L. Zissu.
August 10 – Virginia Stephen marries Leonard Woolf at St Pancras Town Hall in London. They honeymoon in Provence, Spain and Italy before returning.
September 21 – Harley Granville-Barker's production of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale opens at the Savoy Theatre, London, with simplified scenery, ensemble acting and naturalistic verse-speaking.  It is replaced in November by his production of Twelfth Night.
October
Edgar Rice Burroughs' character Tarzan (Viscount Greystoke, raised as a feral child by the fictional Mangani great apes) first appears in Tarzan of the Apes in the American pulp magazine The All-Story.
Sax Rohmer's character Fu Manchu (a "Yellow Peril" master criminal) first appears in "The Zayat Kiss" in the English pulp magazine Story-Teller, as the first installment of The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu.

October 25 – The first issue of Simbolul is put out in Bucharest by Marcel Janco, Tristan Tzara and Ion Vinea.
December? (or at latest January 1913) – A Slap in the Face of Public Taste (Пощёчина общественному вкусу), the seminal text of Russian Futurism, is published as a manifesto and a poetry almanac. Edited and written by David Burliuk, Viktor Khlebnikov, Aleksei Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky, it attacks the tradition of Russian Symbolism, notably works by Leonid Andreyev, Konstantin Balmont, Alexander Blok and Ivan Bunin, and ridicules independents such as Maxim Gorky.
unknown dates
The texts of 13 Sanskrit dramas, perhaps from the first centuries BCE and probably by Bhāsa (including the Svapnavasavadattam), are found by the scholar T. Ganapati Sastri in a palm-leaf codex in Kerala.
Publication of the Loeb Classical Library, parallel text editions of the classics begins at the London publisher Heinemann.
