Garth Marenghi is a fictional horror author created by English comedian Matthew Holness. He is depicted as a conceited hack writer, who remains blissfully (or even wilfully) unaware of his lack of talent. Holness has used Marenghi as the framing device for a number of horror parody works, which the character presents as the products of his own supposed genius.
The character has appeared in two stage shows, the Perrier Award-nominated Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight and Perrier Award-winning Garth Marenghi's Netherhead, and the Channel 4 TV series Garth Marenghi's Darkplace and Man to Man with Dean Learner.
After winning the Perrier Award, the creators confounded media sources by refusing to speak out of character, or give real names or backgrounds.


== Character ==
Garth Marenghi is a spoof pulp horror author; his act and his works are considered a parody of the horror genre.
The character is highly conceited and narcissistic, often described through epithets such as "the dream weaver", "shaman", "titan of terror", "The One Man Fear Factory", “The Fright Honourable”, and "master of the macabre." Marenghi speaks in an exaggerated, doltish South Eastern accent, possibly located around Romford, Essex, or Leytonstone. Rather like E. L. Wisty, arguably the accent might have associations with an odd, imbecilic pub bore: somebody that one might avoid. The accent comically undermines the often pretentious, absurd and grandiose things the character says. In interviews, he compares himself positively with James Joyce, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, and Jesus.
Despite this, Marenghi displays a general ignorance of many subjects of which he claims knowledge. He claims to be self-taught, having left school young ("I knew by the age of eight that my education had finished"), and despite his claims to being a literary genius he rarely reads books. When he needs to learn about a subject, he will "hire someone to go and find out about it." In both stage shows, in the official website, and in numerous interviews he claims to have written more books than he has read.
Marenghi displays other traits including sexism, xenophobia, and extreme paranoia. Darkplace protagonist Rick Dagless is largely characterized as an author insert of Marenghi, drawing on his own insecurities and experiences in writing him. During the Darkplace Illuminatum DVD feature Marenghi comments "In many ways he is an extension of my own natural abilities. He's got a little more than me. He is a little more tragic than I am, as a character. He's seen the dark side. A little too much."
He is depicted as married with four daughters, though disappointed at not having a son. The Darkplace episode "Skipper the Eye Child" explains this, and references this in its plot with Dagless shown as having a deceased son who was half boy, half grasshopper.


== Appearances ==


=== Stage ===

The character of Marenghi was invented for the horror parody stage show Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight.


=== Garth Marenghi's Darkplace ===

The 2004 show Garth Marenghi's Darkplace is based on the premise that Garth Marenghi wrote and starred in a 1980s low-budget hospital-based horror show. Within this fictional context, 50 shows were created, but were never shown as they were suppressed by "MI-8" for being "too subversive, too dangerous, too damn scary."


=== Other television appearances ===
Marenghi also guests in the first episode of Dean Learner's talk series, Man to Man with Dean Learner, where he reveals that he lost an ear in an ambulance crash, has written a total of 436 books, and has filmed a new movie, War of the Wasps, featuring most of the cast of Garth Marenghi's Darkplace. Marenghi has appeared in an episode of the Russell Howard Hour as part of a Christmas special to read a portion of one of his novels, Flay Bells Sting, Are You Glistening?


=== Tours ===
Beginning in 2022, Holness has also used Garth Marenghi as a pen name for his horror parody books, giving a series of book tours in character as Marenghi.


=== Podcast ===
In 2025, Holness launched the podcast Garth Marenghi's Skull-Flusher, in which he interviews "terror titans" as Marenghi, starting with horror film director Mike Flanagan.
