Christine Boisson (8 April 1956 – 21 October 2024) was a French actress.


== Biography ==
Boisson was born in Salon-de-Provence on 8 April 1956; her mother was French and her father was from the West Indies. After she registered in a model agency, Just Jaeckin liked her photo, and she got a part in the film Emmanuelle starring Sylvia Kristel, in which she played a lollipop-sucking teenager who masturbates over a picture of Paul Newman. Then she got some more film roles, but she also continued to study acting.
In 1977, she made her stage debut in Chekhov's The Seagull directed by Bruno Bayen.
In 1984, she received the Prix Romy Schneider (most promising actress awards) for Rue Barbare.
In 2005, she was starring in the stage play Viol by Botho Strauß (based on Titus Andronicus), directed by Luc Bondy.
In 2010, it was widely reported that she had attempted suicide after she climbed over the parapet of her 5th floor apartment and was stopped by firefighters. In a later interview, she said she had done this after an argument with her boyfriend at the time as an act of psychological manipulation, an action she was not proud of. She also described growing up with an abusive mother who constantly reminded her that she had almost died giving birth to her, and sexually abused both her and her brother.
Boisson died from lung disease at a care home in Paris on 21 October 2024, at the age of 68. She had a daughter.
