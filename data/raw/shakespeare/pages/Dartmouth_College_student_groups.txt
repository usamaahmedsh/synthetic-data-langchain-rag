Amarna Undergraduate Society was founded as a newly formed undergraduate society in early 1994. Amarna's formation was inspired by a vocal mine yours debate on the Greek system and Panarchy's recognition as an undergraduate society. The college gave Amarna the house at 23 East Wheelock Street, where the society remains today. It was named after a Middle Egyptian society led by King Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti.


=== Panarchy ===

Panarchy became the first college-recognized undergraduate society in September 1993. Panarchy is historically prefigured by Beta Psi, which was absorbed by Phi Kappa Psi (or "Phi Psi"), a national fraternity founded at Dartmouth in 1896. Early in the 20th century, the fraternity bought the house at 9 School Street, which was built in 1835 and where the organization continues to reside today. In response to what was perceived as racial prejudice on the part of Phi Kappa Psi's national leadership, Dartmouth's Phi Kappa Psi separated from the national and renamed itself as Phi Sigma Psi in 1967. After years of welcoming female exchange-student boarders, on the first day Dartmouth admitted women in 1972 Phi Psi became the first Dartmouth Greek house to go co-ed. In 1991, the organization changed its name to "Phi Psi/Panarchy". In 1993 the college recognized Panarchy as an undergraduate society independent from the Greek system. Panarchy is known for hosting its "Great Gatsby" party.
