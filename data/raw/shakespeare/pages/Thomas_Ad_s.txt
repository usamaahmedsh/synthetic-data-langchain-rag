== Biography ==
Adès was born in London to art historian Dawn Adès and poet Timothy Adès. His surname is of Syrian Jewish origin. Adès is gay and identified his sexuality closely with the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in his youth.
Adès studied piano with Paul Berkowitz and later composition with Robert Saxton at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London. After attending University College School, he achieved a double starred first in 1992 at King's College, Cambridge, studying with Alexander Goehr and Robin Holloway. He was appointed Britten Professor of Composition in the Royal Academy of Music and in 2004 was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Essex.
In 2007, a retrospective festival of Adès's work was presented at the Barbican Arts Centre in London and he was the focus of Radio France's annual contemporary music festival, "Présences", and Helsinki's "Musica Nova" festival. The Barbican festival, "Traced Overhead: The Musical World of Thomas Adès", included the UK premiere of a new work for Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic, Tevot. Journalist Tom Service wrote of the piece, "Of any piece of new music I've heard at its premiere, this is one of the most immediately, richly powerful." In the spring of 2007, The Tempest returned to the Royal Opera House.
In 2009 Adès was the focus of Stockholm Concert Hall's annual Composer Festival, and in 2010 he was made a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. Five years later he was elected to the Board of Directors of the European Academy of Music Theatre. For 2022 Adès was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Music and Opera. He won an Ivor Novello Award in 2023: his composition Növények, for mezzo-soprano and piano sextet, won for Best Chamber Ensemble Composition. In September 2024 Adès was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal by Simon Rattle at the BBC Proms.
