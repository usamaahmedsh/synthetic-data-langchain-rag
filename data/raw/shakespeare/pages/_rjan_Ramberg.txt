He was later educated in the dramatic arts at Sweden's National Academy of Dramatic Art (in Sweden colloquially known as "Scenskolan") in Malmö, 1974–1977. Since 1978, he has been part of Sweden's Royal Dramatic Theatre ensemble.
In 1969, he recorded a single, "Balladen om killen", produced by Göran Lagerberg, which became a minor hit on Tio i Topp, reaching number 13.

In the 2000s, he has collaborated on stage with directors Ingmar Bergman and John Caird in particular. He portrayed Johansson in Strindberg's classic The Ghost Sonata, directed by Bergman in 2000, Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream, directed by Caird in 2000, The Emcee in the musical Cabaret (2001), Malvolio in Twelfth Night (Caird), Ibsen's Gengångare (Ghosts), (directed by Bergman; 2002) and the leading role in Molière's Den inbillade sjuke (The Imaginary Invalid) in 2003.
He appeared as Charles Condomine in Noël Coward's Min fru går igen (Blithe Spirit) (2005), in the co-Nordic production of the Sami staging of Ibsen's Kungsämnena (The Pretenders) and in Shakespeare's Macbeth (directed by Staffan Valdemar Holm) spring/autumn 2006.
On film and TV, he has appeared sporadically for example as the investigating photographer Harry Friberg in the Stieg Trenter-crime films for television (Lysande landning, Idag röd, Träff i helfigur) in 1987, as Chief Editor Schyman in Colin Nutley's thriller Sprängaren (aka Deadline/The Bomber), based on the book by Liza Marklund, and his recent supporting part as the bar pianist in TV-series Möbelhandlarens dotter (The Furniture Salesman's Daughter) (2006).
In 1994 Ramberg was awarded the Golden Mask (which is the Swedish equivalent to the Tony Award/s) for Best Actor for his portrayal of Murphy in the stage production of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (at Folkan 1993/94) and in 2001 he received the prestigious Eugene O'Neill Award.
On 3 February 2007, John Caird's production of Strindberg's The Dance of Death premiered at the Royal Dramatic Theatre with Ramberg in the lead as The Captain (with both original parts of the play performed together; Dödsdansen I-II).
In the spring of 2008, he appeared as King Claudius in Staffan Valdemar Holm's production of Hamlet by Shakespeare (original cast), and in the spring of 2009 in Chekhov's Uncle Vanya.
His work there was discontinued by the Royal Dramatic Theatre in the end of March 2019 following demonstrations triggered by a Sveriges Television documentary Josefin Nilsson – Love me for who I am which, without mentioning him by name, revealed his physical and mental aggression, including death threats, against deceased ex-partner Josefin Nilsson.


=== Personal life ===
Besides Nilsson, in the mid-1970s and 1980s Ramberg was the love partner of Swedish actress and Royal Dramatic Theatre colleague Lena Olin with whom he has a son. In the 1980s-1990s he also lived with actress Ewa Fröling with whom he has daughter Tilde Fröling.
