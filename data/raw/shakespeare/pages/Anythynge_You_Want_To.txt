Anythynge You Want To is a 2001 CD release by the Firesign Theatre presenting an uncut version of their 1982 comedy LP album Shakespeare's Lost Comedie.  It takes the form of a radio play, under the conceit of being a lost work of Shakespeare, using language, plot structure, and characters which parody Shakespeare's original works.  It was originally recorded in 1980 as a program for National Public Radio's Earplay.
