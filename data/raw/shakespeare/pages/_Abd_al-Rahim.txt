'Abd al-Raḥīm (ALA-LC romanization of Arabic: عبد الرحيم) is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words 'abd, al-Raḥīm, one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names. It means "servant of the merciful".
Because the letter r is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus, although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Rahim, the standard pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Rahim. Alternative transliterations include Abdel Raheem, Abdur Raheem, Abdul Rahiem and other regional linguistic variations, and subject to variant spacing or hyphenation.
