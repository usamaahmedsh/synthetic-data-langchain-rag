Leasowe () is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. Located on the north coast of the Wirral Peninsula, it is approximately 2 mi (3.2 km) to the west of Wallasey.
Historically within Cheshire, Leasowe was part of the old County Borough of Wallasey. It is now within the Leasowe and Moreton East Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. Leasowe is also part of the parliamentary constituency of Wallasey.
At the 2001 census, Leasowe had a population of 6,180. 
By the time of the 2011 census, specific figures for Leasowe were no longer maintained; the total population of the Leasowe and Moreton East ward was 14,640.


== History ==
The name Leasowex comes from the Anglo-Saxon Leasowes or Meadow Pastures; its sand dunes are the largest such system on the Wirral. Much of the area is at or below sea level and is protected by the coastal embankment. Houses built in the early 20th century were often flooded and unsanitary but, after about 1926, new roads and drainage were put in by the Borough Council and much new housing was developed. Along the embankment between Leasowe and Moreton are the remains of fortifications built during the Second World War.
The world's first passenger hovercraft service operated in 1961–62; the service travelled from Moreton Common and was advertised as between Wallasey and Rhyl in North Wales. However, the service was not profitable and soon ceased.


== Geography ==
The River Fender merges with the Birket at Leasowe; the Birket then continues towards West Float at the site of the former Wallasey Pool.


== Landmarks ==


=== Solar School ===

The Solar Campus, on Leasowe Road, is the former St Georges Secondary School, and is the site of the Solar Building, the first building in the world to be heated entirely by solar energy. At 53.4°N, it is also the most northerly. The school was built in 1955, in the contemporary style as the St Georges Secondary School for Girls; in 1958, it was decided to admit boys, requiring a doubling in capacity. 
This was met by building a new block, now known as the Solar Building, to a design by Emslie Morgan, the Assistant Borough Architect, who spent a lifetime looking into ways of harnessing the sun's rays. His design featured a high south-facing solar wall, largely of glass, to absorb the sun's warmth, a sloping well-insulated roof, and a low blind north-facing wall backing the buildings corridor. The solar wall is built of glass leaves two feet apart; these draw the ultra violet rays from sunshine and reflect them around the walls of the classrooms. The walls become warm and heat the air. Hardly any warmth escapes through the school's massively thick roof and walls covered with slabs of plastic foam. On the coldest days it is always 60 °F (16 °C) inside and, in summer, the school is cooler than its more conventional neighbours; panels inside the glass wall can be turned to deflect heat or absorb it.
In practice, the large convector ducts which direct the warmed air to the colder north side of the building are a major safety hazard; fire breaks have had to be inserted to reduce or cut off the air flow. The result is that, on sunny days, the south glazed side of the building reaches unbearable temperatures in excess of 40 °C, while for most of the time the unglazed north side never reaches a comfortable temperature nor receives much natural light.
A small secondary single-pipe heating system was installed to give additional heating on cold winter days with very few hours of sunlight but, by 1966, it had never been used and was dismantled. In 1963, the Liverpool Echo reported that during the previous winter temperatures never dropped below 60 °F (16 °C), while in the summer it was cooler than the older part of the school. Today, the secondary heating has to be used very often and is expensive.
The property is Grade II listed and is maintained by the Children & Young People's Department of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, which struggles to find the necessary revenue and capital to fully maintain it.


=== Leasowe Castle ===

Leasowe Castle may have been built for Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby – a patron of Shakespeare – in 1593, possibly (though this is disputed) as an observation platform for the Wallasey races which took place on the sands in the 16th and 17th centuries, and which are regarded as a forerunner of the Derby races. Ferdinando's brother William, the 6th Earl, was described as a noted sportsman and is remembered as a keen supporter of the Wallasey races.
At first the castle consisted only of an octagonal tower. This had become disused by 1700, and it became known as "Mockbeggar Hall", a term often used for an ornate but derelict building. The term Mockbeggar Wharf is still used for the adjoining foreshore. The Mockbeggar Hall is also the name of a Wetherspoons pub in neighbouring Moreton.
In 1821, ownership passed to the Cust family. After 1826, the building was used as a hotel for some years. The ceiling of the Star Chamber at the Palace of Westminster was brought to the castle in 1836 along with panelling and other furnishings; they had been salvaged from the old Palace of Westminster before the Star Chamber was demolished in an 1806 building project. The Star Chamber was so called because the ceiling was decorated with bright stars. The ceiling and four tapestries depicting the four seasons still remain. Oak panelling from the Star Chamber and some made from the submerged forest along the coast were also installed; however, these were removed in 1893.
Between 1911 and 1970, it became a railway convalescent home; between 1974 and 1980, it was owned by Wirral Borough Council. It reopened as a hotel in December 1982 and was acquired by Lawton Hotels Ltd in 2000. The building became a popular venue for weddings and other family functions, with around 50 bedrooms. The hotel closed "until further notice" in February 2025.
Leasowe Castle is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.


=== Leasowe Lighthouse ===

Leasowe Lighthouse was built in 1763 by Liverpool Corporation's Docks Committee (the forerunner of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board) and is the oldest brick-built lighthouse in Britain. According to local tradition its foundations were built on bales of cotton from a nearby shipwreck. Around 1763, William Hutchinson installed what may have been the first parabolic reflector in a lighthouse. The lighthouse was one of four lights on the North Wirral foreshore, the others being two at Hoylake and another – a lower light – at Leasowe. The latter was soon destroyed by the sea and was replaced by a lighthouse on Bidston Hill in 1771.
The lighthouse was operational until 14 July 1908, 
with the only known female lighthouse keeper in those days, a Mrs. Williams. It then became a tearoom for a period, but was unused before 1989, since when it has been the base for the ranger service of the North Wirral Coastal Park. The lighthouse is a Grade II listed building and houses a visitor centre which is occasionally open to the public.


=== Leasowe Hospital ===

Leasowe Hospital or The Leasowe Sanatorium For Crippled Children and Hospital for Tuberculosis, to give its full and original name, later became known as the Liverpool Open-Air Hospital, Leasowe, and finally Leasowe Hospital. Margaret Beavan (1877–1931) was the driving force of the hospital, admired by all, she was known affectionately as the "Little Mother of Liverpool", also not quite as complimentary, the "Mighty Atom" and "Clever Beggar".
The first mention of a sanatorium for children with tuberculosis occurred on 16 December 1911. Slowly, Leasowe Hospital changed from being principally a children's T.B. hospital to one for dealing with burns and skin grafts, and then arthritis until its closure in 1979. Another name closely associated with Leasowe, amongst others, is that of (the late) Dr T.R. Littler, Consultant Rheumatologist, who was devoted to Leasowe. Leasowe Hospital was eventually bought by the Wirral Christian Centre in 1981; it was used later as a retirement home and handicap centre. After failing to make that facility work, the buildings were eventually repossessed then later demolished around 2002–03. Luxury flats and houses have since been built on the site.


==== Notable staff at Leasowe Hospital ====
Edith Marie Tucker (1876-unknown), Matron of the new hospital building from 1915 to 1919. Tucker trained at The London Hospital under Matron Eva Luckes between 1904 and 1906.

Probationer nurses trained for two years at Leasowe in the nursing care of children with Surgical Tuberculosis.


== Transport ==

Leasowe railway station is a stop on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network. Electric trains run every 15 minutes during the day eastbound to Liverpool Central and westbound to West Kirby; this reduces to 30 minutes in late evenings and on Sundays.
Bus services in the area are operated primarily by Arriva North West, A2B Travel and Al's Coaches. Routes connect Leasowe with nearby towns including Birkenhead, Hoylake and Wallasey; the 423 provides a regular service to Whitechapel, Liverpool.


== Governance ==
