In 2010, Oberoi appeared in Prince, which failed to receive a good response from the audience, despite a good opening. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated it 3 out of 5, saying "Prince has all merits to strike a chord with the youth", praising Oberoi's 'bravura' performance, the film's 'Hollywood style' look and action sequences, as well as the music. Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL India gave 3 out of 5, saying, "once you are willing to let go off your beliefs and logic – like you really can't jump off a cliff on your bike and remain unscratched – you would like the film." On the other hand, Omar Qureshi of Zoom rated Prince 2.5 out of 5, saying, "The film is over-the-top and unrealistic." Indiatimes.com rated it 2 out of 5 stars saying, "The film has taken the audience for granted, which shows us gadgets hard to believe and futuristic and that such futuristic shows should be limited to Hollywood.". Subhash K. Jha gave 2 out of 5 stars, and said, "Prince wears its super-cool shirt with the slogan 'Come Watch Me' with a little bit too much aggression. But if you love popcorn crunching adventure stories watch Vivek Oberoi play the hero from the hemisphere of hijinks." He praised Oberoi's acting and the action sequences, saying that "To his credit, Oberoi carries off the ceaseless stint with the stunt with arresting aplomb[...]The expertly-executed stunts frequently see our hero jumping down high-rise buildings in breathtaking leaps of fate, with the camera pulling back in respectful awe."
In the same year, he appeared in Ram Gopal Varma's Rakht Charitra playing the role of the Telugu politician Paritala Ravi. Oberoi's performance in the role of Paritala Ravi drew widespread praise, while Abhimanyu Singh's devious turn as Bukka Reddy, modelled on the real-life Obul Reddy, was regarded as one of the most terrifying villainous acts captured on celluloid in a long time.

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 4 stars in a scale of 5, saying that "On the whole, RAKHT CHARITRA is not for the faint-hearted or the lily-livered.

Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, stating that "Rakta Charitra holds up a brutal mirror on the muck that masquerades as democracy in India." Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars, noting that "Rakta Charitra is a bold, disturbing film that's bursting with the kind of confidence we haven't seen from the filmmaker recently. If the sight of blood doesn't make you uncomfortable, chances are you'll enjoy this film."
Oberoi produced a film named Dekh Indian Circus in 2011. The film was featured in the 16th Busan Film festival, winning the Audience Choice Award for Best Film from 3000 films worldwide and among 380 films screened. In 16 years of the history of Busan, this is the First Indian Film to win the award. The film has already received rave reviews from international critics and reporters from The Hollywood Reporter, Variety and Screen International. The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from the critics. Richard Kuipers of Variety praised it for "bringing the themes of inequality and class divisions together in the highly entertaining visit to the big top."

Oberoi's film Kismat Love Paisa Dilli, which was released in October 2012, failed to impress the audience and was a box office failure.
He also played supervillain Kaal in Krrish 3 (2013). Critics directed praise towards cast performances (particularly Hrithik Roshan, Kangana Ranaut and Oberoi), VFX, cinematography, background score, direction and entertainment value, but criticism has been directed towards the film's lack of originality, soundtrack and writing.

Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India gave it 4.5 stars while commenting "For sheer vision, bravado and superlative execution, this one soars to new orbits. Latch on to this cape for an exhilarating ride." Raedita Tandan of Filmfare awarded it 4 out of 5 stars, remarking "Hats off to Rakesh Roshan for dreaming big and actually pulling off this risky proposition. It's not perfect. But it has all the elements a good, entertaining film must have. All you Marvel superheroes, better watch out. Krrish is here to stay." Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave it 3.5 stars and said, "Filmmaker Rakesh Roshan deserves a round of applause for giving us a homegrown superhero. Krrish 3 is ambitious and exciting." Sarita Tanwar of DNA gave it 3.5 stars and wrote, "Krrish 3 is fast-paced and the VFX effects are smashing." Rohit Khilnani of India Today gave it 3.5 stars noting, "The only part where the movie dips are during the songs. The music sounds too dated for this action-packed film." The film earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.


=== 2014–present: Professional expansion and commercial decline ===
Oberoi dubbed the voice of Electro in the Hindi-dubbed version of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which was released in May 2014.
In 2017, Oberoi made his Tamil debut in supporting role alongside Ajith Kumar in action thriller film Vivegam. The film received mixed reviews from critics. The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 and said "Vivegam is an over-the-top but engaging action thriller with a calculated mix of brawn and brain, action and sentiment, smartly pandering to fans while giving families something to connect with." NDTV rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and cited "Ajith Is Charismatic But Let Down By Silly Scenes". Behindwoods rated the film 2.25 out of 5, stating, "Vivegam – High on production value and action. Heavily dependent on Ajith's persona, engagement factor takes a beating". Mirchi9 gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, saying "Overall, Vivekam is for the fans and fans alone for whom just watching the star on screen is enough. There is ample style and punch dialogues with a healthy dose of action. For everyone else, it is an utterly boring film". Nowrunning rated the film 1.5/5 and said "Director Siva had collected a bunch of Spy movies from Hollywood and made a mashup of them. He picked up all the action blocks and combined it with loud background score which will only irk the audience. Even the action is also missing in the second half and there is no logic at all. The climax is stretched further which disappoints the audience". The film earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor – Tamil.
Oberoi worked with YRF banner's film Bank Chor, with Rhea Chakraborty and Riteish Deshmukh.
He also appeared in Ram Charan starrer Telugu film Vinaya Vidheya Rama (2019), It received negative reviews from critics and became a box-office bomb, which prompted Charan to issue an apology letter. The Indian Express gave 1 out of 5 stars stating "Vinaya Vidheya Rama is like watching a Balakrishna action film on steroids. Clumsy and unconvincing screenplay". The New Indian Express gave 1.5 out of 5 stars stating "If there is a plot and a story that is worth a notice, then it is lost between all the fights, songs, dances and random elevation dialogues". Hindustan Times gave 0.5 out of 5 stars stating "The film itself feels dated. It is a mess that even Ram Charan – with all the weird stunts -- cannot punch his way out of". Firstpost gave 1.5 out of 5 stars stating "Realism has absolutely no place in the world of Vinaya Vidheya Rama".
In 2019, Oberoi made his Malayalam debut with Mohanlal in Prithviraj Sukumaran's directorial debut, Lucifer, as the main antagonist, Bobby, in which his performance as a villain was well received by critics and the audience. Times of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 writing "Lucifer is a 'mass entertainer' that is sure to please the fans and has enough going for to make it an engaging thriller as well. And apart from the mandatory Stan Lee, correction, Antony Perumbavoor cameo, watch out for Stephen's second avatar in the film."
He has featured as a talent judge for three seasons of the reality show India's Best Dramebaaz.  He portrayed the role of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in PM Narendra Modi. The film was universally panned by critics, who termed it a hagiography and criticised Oberoi's performance. Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India gave the film two and a half stars out of five and criticised the script, opining, "This one is too lopsided for you to appreciate. It leaves a lot unanswered. While it firmly believes 'Modi ek insaan nahi, soch hai', we wish the script was as thoughtful". However, she was among the few who appreciated Oberoi's performance- "He gets the mannerisms, accent and tone right and thankfully doesn't overdo it". Writing for The Indian Express, Shubhra Gupta gave the movie two stars out of five and stated, "The film is not a mere bio-pic, it is a full-fledged, unabashed, unapologetic hagiography". Kennith Rosario of The Hindu summarised the movie's narrative as "a obsequious love letter" to the protagonist which tells the audience "how sincere, hardworking, fair and honest Modi is, [and] that it makes you wonder if life is a parody of this film".
In 2022, he starred in Malayalam language film Kaduva opposite Prithviraj Sukumaran. Despite receiving mixed reviews, it was a commercial success. Sajin Shrijith of The New Indian Express found Oberoi's character to be "basic". He also starred in a short film, Verses of War.

== Personal life ==
Oberoi's full first name, Vivekanand, is based on that of the Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda; his father and grandfathers were followers of the monk. He says he dropped Anand when he joined Film out of respect for Vivekananda, as he considered it would be embarrassing romancing and dancing on screen with the name of the monk. Oberoi credits Kareena Kapoor as his inspiration for adopting a vegetarian diet.
Oberoi dated his Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... co-star Aishwarya Rai. In 2003, Oberoi claimed that Rai's former boyfriend, Salman Khan, had threatened him. In 2005, Oberoi and Rai broke up.

On 29 October 2010, Oberoi married Priyanka Alva, daughter of Karnataka minister Jeevaraj Alva, in Bangalore. The couple have a son and a daughter.


== Philanthropy ==
Oberoi's company, Karrm Infrastructure Pvt Ltd., has donated 25 flats in the Thane district of Maharashtra to the families of Central Reserve Police Force officers killed in action. In all, Oberoi has donated about ₹ 3 million and helped raise ₹ 25 million.
The alleged housing scam involving Karrm Infrastructure Pvt Ltd has impacted over 11,500 homebuyers across Mumbai, Shahapur, and Palghar. The Enforcement Directorate has provisionally attached assets worth ₹19.61 crore, citing misappropriation of ₹320 crore collected from buyers, which was diverted for personal use and lavish expenditures. The Bombay High Court has criticised the police's investigation and ordered the case to be transferred to the state CID's Economic Offences Wing. Buyers have reported being misled by attractive advertisements and endorsements from celebrities, leading to financial distress and damaged credit scores due to unauthorised loans taken in their names. Despite legal actions and court interventions, many affected individuals are still awaiting justice and the fulfilment of promised housing.
Oberoi is the only Indian actor to be featured by Forbes for his philanthropic contributions in the areas of health, education, and disaster relief. His recognition highlights a sustained commitment to social impact beyond his film career. Oberoi's work includes support for cancer patients, initiatives in rural education, and active involvement in disaster relief efforts. This acknowledgment placed him among a select group of global celebrities noted for their humanitarian efforts.
As part of Project DEVI, thousands of girls were rescued from child labour and poverty in Vrindavan. The initiative, led by the Yashodhara Oberoi Foundation, focused on promoting girls’ education and empowering women to achieve economic self-sufficiency. However, the absence of a social audit makes it difficult to verify how many beneficiaries were actually impacted on the ground. In 2021, he donated Rs 25 lakh to the fund created to overcome the shortage of oxygen cylinders in hospitals.
