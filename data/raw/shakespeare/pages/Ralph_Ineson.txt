Also in 2014, he had a small role in the spy film Kingsman: The Secret Service, playing a policeman who interviews Eggsy.
In 2016, Ineson starred alongside Anya Taylor-Joy and Kate Dickie in Robert Eggers's critically acclaimed debut film The Witch, which saw Eggers win Best Director at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. Ineson later credited Eggers and the film as offering him a career breakthrough stating: "(Eggers) gave me this amazing part in an amazing film with other incredible actors, and that changed everything for me. It gave me a lot of confidence in myself that if it came down to it, I did actually have the chops to be able to play a character with a proper arc and some nuance. It was much more than I’d been given to play with before, and that led to more work with Rob and also Steven Spielberg, the Coen brothers and all sorts of amazing filmmakers."
Ineson appeared in a minor role as a First Order officer in the 2017 film Star Wars: The Last Jedi. His role was originally bigger, but most of his performance was cut. The cut material is available in a deleted scene on the 2018 Blu-ray release of the film.

In 2025, Ineson portrayed the gigantic Marvel Comics planet-eating supervillain Galactus in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film The Fantastic Four: First Steps. Ineson was offered the part without having to audition. Speaking about his preparation for the part, which he performed in heavy armor,  Ineson said "there were little crosses of electric tape on the floor, which is why you have to do the preparation work for the character long before you set foot on set. The day-to-day job of getting the character onto screen is more of a physical challenge, but to make that cross of tape on the floor real in your own mind, you have to have your emotional memory ready to go. So I went to the tallest buildings I could find to have Galactus’ perspective, and when I was looking down at the floor, I could see that perspective, not just a piece of tape."
