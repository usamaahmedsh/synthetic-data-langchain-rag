Her career encompassed all genres, including radio, theatre, television, and film. She appeared in many dramatic as well as comedy roles throughout a career spanning some 56 years.

== Early life and education ==
Ruth Winifred Cracknell was born on 6 July 1925 in Maitland, New South Wales to Charles Cracknell and Winifred Goddard (nee Watts). When she was four years old, the family moved to Sydney. She was educated at North Sydney Girls High School and, after graduating, worked at the Ku-ring-gai Council as a stenographer. 
In 1943 she joined the Modern Theatre Players drama school, run by Edna Spilsbury. She resigned from the council in 1945 to become a professional actress.


== Career ==


=== Radio and theatre ===
Cracknell's first acting jobs were in radio, starting at AWA recording studios in 1945. By 1946, she was performing five episodes of radio plays a week. She also performed on stage with the Sydney-based companies the Independent Theatre and the Mercury Theatre. In 1948, she joined the John Alden Company and had roles in King Lear, Measure for Measure and The Tempest. 
In 1952, at the age of 27, she left Australia to work in London for two years.


=== Screen ===
Cracknell appeared in many TV serial productions, and made-for-TV films. One of her first roles was Reflections in Dark Glasses, a one-off drama broadcast in 1960. She was a hostess of children television series Play School in the mid to late 1960s. She also played in  the 1973 award-winning ABC-TV dramatisation of Ethel Turner's Australian children's classic Seven Little Australians. In the 1980s she guest starred in A Country Practice.
Cracknell is best known for her role in the ABC television series Mother and Son. Written by Geoffrey Atherden, who previously had written for The Aunty Jack Show, the series was based on the writer's own family experience. Mother and Son first screened on 16 January 1984; it continued for six seasons for over a decade and is often repeated. Cracknell played an elderly woman, Maggie Beare, who was slowly becoming senile. She was cared for by her long-suffering younger son Arthur (Garry McDonald), to whom she was often indifferent but on whom she was also dependent and whom she often cynically played off against her self-centred older son Robert (Henri Szeps) and daughter-in-law Liz (played by Judy Morris).
Cracknell appeared in film productions including opposite Chips Rafferty in the 1958 classic Smiley Gets a Gun, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), the 1983 The Night the Prowler (1978), and The Dismissal (1983) as Margaret Whitlam. Later in 1996, she starred opposite Toni Collette in Lilian's Story as Sydney eccentric Beatrice Miles.

Her best-known role was in the stage production of The Importance of Being Earnest as Lady Bracknell. The production was so popular that it was an "ongoing" stage production from 1988 to 1992 and was televised by the ABC. She was also Patron of the Australian Theatre for Young People.
