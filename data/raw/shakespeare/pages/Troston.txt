Troston is a village and civil parish in Suffolk, England, five miles north-east of Bury St Edmunds. Its parish church contains rare mediaeval wall paintings, including dragon-slaying and the Martyrdom of St Edmund. 
The local pub, The Bull, had been a central part of the village since the late 1800s, but was closed, leaving it boarded up. Owners, brewers Greene King, sold it, and The Bull has now reopened as a Free House with a restaurant.
Troston Hall, to the south of the village, is a Grade II* listed late 16th century manor house, with the Grade II listed Hall Farm to its north.
There are sixteen listed buildings in the village.
