Jeffrey Kevin (born 1945) is an Australian actor, theatre director, choreographer, writer, and former drama lecturer best known for his role in the television soap opera Number 96, from 1972 to 1977 as Arnold Feather for 338 episodes.
His character was involved in some of the more-remarkable story lines in the program, including his marriage to Patti Olsen and her subsequent death at the hands of the "Pantyhose Strangler". He also fell in love with Robyn Ross, who he did not realise was transgender. That broke new ground for a TV serial, in that Ross was played by cabaret artist Carlotta, who was the first transgender actress to portray a transgender character anywhere in the world.
