ʻAbd al-Razzāq (ALA-LC romanization of Arabic: عبد الرزاق) is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ʻabd and al-Razzāq, one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names. It means "servant of the all-provider".
Because the letter r is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Razzaq, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Razzaq. Alternative renderings include ‘Abd ar-Razzaq, Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Razaq, Abdul Razzak and others, all subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.
