Philip Mark Quast  (born 30 July 1957) is an Australian actor and bass-baritone singer. He has won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical three times, making him the first actor to have three wins in that category.
He is perhaps best known for his role as Inspector Javert in the stage musical Les Misérables and in the Les Misérables: The Dream Cast in Concert.
He is also well-known for numerous other theatre roles, notable ones being Georges Seurat/George in Sunday in the Park with George (which won him a Laurence Olivier Award), Archibald Craven and Dr. Neville Craven in The Secret Garden, Judge Turpin in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, George Banks in Mary Poppins, Georges in La Cage aux Folles, Juan Peron in Evita, Fred Anderson in A Christmas Carol, and The Wolf and Cinderella's Prince in Into the Woods. 
He is also known for appearances in film and for his roles in television shows such as Ultraviolet, Brides of Christ, and Play School.


== Early life and education ==
Quast, one of three children, was born in 1957 in Tamworth, New South Wales. His family lived and worked on a mixed, but predominantly turkey, farm. He graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1979.


== Acting career ==


=== 1980s ===


==== Theatre ====
After graduating from NIDA in 1979 Quast began his career in the resident acting company of the State Theatre Company of South Australia. In the early 1980s he appeared in plays such as The Mystery Plays of Wakefield, Three Sisters, On the Wallaby, Pericles, A Month in the Country, As You Like It, Pygmalion, A Hard God, No End of Blame, The Threepenny Opera, Shark Infested Waters, Candide with Nimrod Theatre Company, and a musical adaption of Carmen which he debuted with the Melbourne Theatre Company.


==== Les Misérables ====
Quast shot to prominence in 1987 as Javert in the original Australian production of Les Misérables, winning him a Sydney Critic Award and a Mo Award. In 1989, he traveled to London to reprise the role on the West End stage. Quast never expected to gain such a prominent role, going to the auditions hoping simply for a place in the chorus. Unable to sight-read music, he walked off the stage at the audition but was called back by Claude-Michel Schönberg and eventually given the part as Javert.
Quast credits much of his success as Javert to stage director Trevor Nunn. "Javert for me is not the Wicked Witch of the West," Quast has said. "In fact, there is very little material to work with in the script. Trevor would say things in passing like 'Have you read the Ten Commandments recently?' That's all he would say. If you're thirsty enough, you can follow it up ... there was the whole basis of our legal system and the explanation for the whole of Les Mis. For me, that's inspired directing. That's why he's such an awesome man."
When playing Javert, Quast gained a reputation as a perfectionist and began experiencing intense bouts of stagefright. "I had a terrible time," he said. "It took me a month to get over it. At one stage I wasn't sleeping at all but lying awake planning speeches to the audience about being sorry and could I start again."


==== Film and television ====
In 1981, Quast began appearing as a presenter on the Australian children's show Play School, a program he would return to on-and-off again for 17 years. 
From 1982 to 1983, he appeared in a recurring role as Dr Rod Hawkins in Australian medical soap opera The Young Doctors for 20 episodes. From 1984 to 1985, he had another recurring role as Bob 'Mitch' Mitchell in Australian drama soap opera Sons and Daughters for 30 episodes. Quast appeared in several miniseries including Colour in the Creek (1985), Flight into Hell, Fields of Fire (both 1987) and Cassidy (1989). He also made guest appearances in Patrol Boat, A Country Practice and Special Squad.
Quast also appeared in several Australian films including Emoh Ruo (1985), Army Wives (1986, TV movie), Around the World in Eighty Ways, To Market To Market (both 1987) and The First Kangaroos (1988).


=== 1990s ===


==== Theatre ====
Quast's stage success continued as he won the coveted role of Georges Seurat and his act 2 counterpart George in the original London production of Stephen Sondheim's Sunday in the Park with George for the Royal National Theatre.
In 1991 he won his first Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical as Georges Seurat / George. Quast was under a large amount of stress when preparing for Sunday in the Park with George, as he struggled to master Sondheim's complicated musical scores (Sondheim told him: "you don't play tennis against people you can beat."), learn to paint and sketch for the play, all while awaiting the birth of his first son, who was due five days after opening night.
In 1993 he returned to Australia to play in Sydney Theatre Company productions of William Shakespeare's Coriolanus and Sondheim's Into the Woods, in which he played The Wolf/Cinderella's Prince. He then played Dunois in Bernard Shaw’s Saint Joan in the West End and on a UK tour in 1994. In 1994–96 he spent two seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company, performing as Fred/Chorus in A Christmas Carol, and King of Navarre in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost, as well as Lodovico in The White Devil, Banquo in Macbeth, and Achilles in Troilus and Cressida. Before returning for a second season with the RSC, he spent some time back in Australia, performing in the national tour of The Secret Garden as Dr. Neville Craven – along with Anthony Warlow and Marina Prior. 


==== Film and television ====
Quast continued to appear in both Australian and British television roles throughout the 1990s. In 1995 he starred in the miniseries The Damnation of Harvey McHugh as The Minister, Michael Muldoon for 13 episodes. From 1995 to 1996 he appeared as Simon Lennox in British drama series The Governor for 4 episodes, and in 1998 he played Father Pearse J. Harman in 6 episodes of Ultraviolet. In 1999 he played Cornelius in a 1999 miniseries adaptation of Cleopatra. He also had guest roles in Police Rescue, the miniseries Brides of Christ, Crime Story and Inspector Morse.

== Personal life ==
Quast and his wife Carol have three sons (Edwin, Harry and Toby). He also teaches at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney, Australia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Quast continued teaching through Zoom calls.
Quast married Carol in 1981 and they were married for almost ten years before having the first of their three sons.

He doesn't keep any of his awards, instead sending them to his parents' home in Australia.
Quast was named as one of the 25 Most Beautiful People for 1996 in Who Weekly magazine. In an article for the magazine he said, "The problem with this business is that you have to supposedly look as good as you can all the time. And I hate that. My idea of doing my hair is sticking it out of the window of a car when it's wet."
A bass-baritone, Quast has been universally applauded by critics for his singing voice, which has been described as "warm", and "glorious." He was named by British newspaper The Stage as "one of the most notable singing actors to come along in years".
Quast has a strong passion for fishing, and he spent his time during the COVID-19 pandemic fishing, cooking, pickling and preserving.
