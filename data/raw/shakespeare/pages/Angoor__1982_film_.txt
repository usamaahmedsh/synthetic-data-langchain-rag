Angoor (transl. Grapes) is a 1982 Indian Hindi-language comedy film. Starring Sanjeev Kumar and Deven Verma in double roles, it is directed by Gulzar. The film was a remake of the 1963 Bengali-language comedy film Bhranti Bilas that is based on Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Bengali novel by the same name, which itself is based on Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors. Do Dooni Chaar 1968 film is also remake from the same film and was  also adapted by Rohit Shetty as Cirkus. All characters are naïve and destiny plays the main role in bringing all characters to one place. Most of the other films are generally based on false characters and deliberately make false statements to fool others.


== Plot ==
The film is about two pairs of identical twins separated at birth and how their lives go haywire when they meet in adulthood.
Raj Tilak (Utpal Dutt) and his wife (Shammi) are on a trip with their twin sons, both of whom they call Ashok. Since they look the same, they should be called the same, is Mr Tilak's reasoning. As fate would have it, they adopt another set of twins, both of whom they call Bahadur. An unfortunate accident then divides the family, leaving each parent with one child out of each pair of twins.
A few years later, Ashok (Sanjeev Kumar) is married to Sudha (Moushumi Chatterjee) and Bahadur (Deven Verma) is married to Prema (Aruna Irani). They all stay together with Sudha's younger sister Tanu (Deepti Naval). Into their lives enter the other Ashok, a detective novel aficionado, and Bahadur, a bhang (an edible preparation made from the leaves of the cannabis plant) lover. Now there are two Ashoks and two Bahadurs in the same city. This is more than their families, the Jeweller, the Taxi Driver and the Inspector can handle.
