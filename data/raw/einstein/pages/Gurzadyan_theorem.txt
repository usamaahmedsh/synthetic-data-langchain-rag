In cosmology, the Gurzadyan theorem, proved by Vahe Gurzadyan, states the most general functional form for the force satisfying the condition of identity of the gravity of the sphere and of a point mass located in the sphere's center. This theorem thus refers to the first statement of Isaac Newton’s  shell theorem (the identity mentioned above) but not the second one, namely, the absence of gravitational force inside a shell.
The theorem had entered and its importance for cosmology outlined in several papers  as well as in shell theorem.


== Formula and the cosmological constant ==
The formula for the force derived in   has the form

  
    
      
        F
        =
        −
        
          
            
              G
              M
              m
            
            
              r
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        +
        
          
            
              Λ
              
                c
                
                  2

              r
            
            3
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle F=-{\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}+{\frac {\Lambda c^{2}mr}{3}},}
  

where 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Lambda }
  
 are constants. The first term is the familiar law of universal gravitation, the second one corresponds to the cosmological constant term in general relativity and McCrea-Milne cosmology.
Then the field is force-free only in the center of a shell but the confinement (oscillator) term does not change the initial 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        4
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(4)}
  
 symmetry of the Newtonian field. Also, this field corresponds to the only field possessing the property of the Newtonian one: the closing of orbits at any negative value of energy, i.e. the coincidence of the period of variation of the value of the radius vector with that of its revolution by 
  
    
      
        2
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2\pi }
  
 (resonance principle) .


== Consequences: cosmological constant as a physical constant ==
Einstein named the cosmological constant as a universal constant, introducing it to define the static cosmological model. Einstein has stated: “I should have initially set 
  
    
      
        λ
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda =0}
  
 in Newton's sense. But the new considerations speak for a non-zero 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
  
, which strives to bring about a non-zero mean density 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
  
 of matter.” This theorem solves that contradiction between “non-zero 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
  
” and Newton's law.
From this theorem the cosmological constant 
  
    
      
        Λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Lambda }
  
 emerges as additional constant of gravity along with the Newton's gravitational constant 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
. Then, the cosmological constant is dimension independent and matter-uncoupled and hence can be considered even more universal than Newton's gravitational constant.

=== Rescaling of physical constants ===
Within the conformal cyclic cosmology this theorem implies that, in each aeon of an initial value of 
  
    
      
        Λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Lambda }
  
, the values of the 3 physical constants will be eligible for rescaling fulfilling the dimensionless ratio of invariants with respect to the conformal transformation  

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                g
                ~

Then the ratio yields

The dynamics of groups and clusters of galaxies are claimed to fit the theorem, see also.
The possibility of two Hubble flows, a local one, determined by that formula, and a global one, described by Friedmannian cosmological equations was stated in.
