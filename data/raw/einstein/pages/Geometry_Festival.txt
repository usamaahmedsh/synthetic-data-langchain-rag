The Geometry Festival is an annual mathematics conference held in the United States.
The festival has been held since 1985 at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Duke University and New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. It is a three day conference that focuses on the major recent results in geometry and related fields.
