Nation is the eighth studio album by Brazilian metal band Sepultura, released in 2001 through Roadrunner Records. Nation features guest appearances from artists such as Hatebreed singer Jamey Jasta, Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, Ill Niño singer Cristian Machado, Ratos de Porão frontman João Gordo, and Apocalyptica.
According to the official site, a video for "One Man Army" was scheduled to be filmed at the end of August 2001. However, due to a lack of support from Roadrunner Records, the video was never made. Sepultura blamed Roadrunner for not promoting the album and left for SPV in 2002.


== Reception ==

The album received better reviews than Against, but sold fewer copies. As of April 2002, Nation has sold over 55,700 copies in the U.S. and went gold in Brazil.
Q magazine (5/01, p. 118) – 3 stars out of 5 – "A clutch of crowd-pleasingly brutal anthems...with a return to the more exploratory approach of old....the faithful will not be disappointed."
Alternative Press (5/01, p. 63) – 4 out of 5 – "There are plenty of touchstones to [their] days of headbanger hegemony....[new singer] Derrick Green's heightened tunefulness along with the broadened emotional resonance...should relate to an enlarged fanbase."
NME (3/31/01, p. 31) – 6 out of 10 – "Fiercely political and uncomprimisongly direct....it's taut and tense and if you buy it quick you'll get to hear their logic-defying cover of Bauhaus' 'Bela Lugosi's Dead'."
