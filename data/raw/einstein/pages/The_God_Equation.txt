== Overview ==
Kaku explores the history of unification theories of physics starting with Newton's law of universal gravitation which unified our experience of gravity on Earth and the motions of the celestial bodies to Einstein's general relativity and quantum mechanics and the Standard Model. He dubs the final Grand Unified Theory and quantum gravity The God Equation with an 11-dimensional string theory as the only self-consistent theory that seems to fit the bill.
