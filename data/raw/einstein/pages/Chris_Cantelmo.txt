== Cantelmoism ==
In 2013, Cantelmo was diagnosed with brain cancer and had supposedly cured himself by vaping N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, a powerful hallucinogenic compound.
Cantelmoism, the spiritual movement founded by Cantelmo, was rooted in the belief that DMT had the potential to cure illnesses such as brain cancer and unlock higher states of consciousness. Cantelmo promoted his ideas through online platforms, particularly Reddit, where he gained a small but devoted following (often by giving away money) and gained thousands of followers.

The core tenets of Cantelmoism revolved around the use of DMT as a sacrament and a pathway to divine insight. Cantelmo claimed that his own experiences with the substance allowed him to access profound spiritual truths and heal his own mental and physical ailments. He described these revelations as proof of the interconnectedness of all life and the existence of a higher universal consciousness. Cantelmo's teachings mostly centered around the spiritual, psychical, and psychological benefits of DMT but also included other radical beliefs, such as a belief that certain laws of physics were incorrect, aliens are already on earth and predictions about the future.
Cantelmo's movement attracted significant attention but also considerable skepticism and criticism. Critics accused him of promoting pseudoscience and exploiting vulnerable individuals seeking alternative treatments for serious illnesses. His online presence often became a battleground between supporters, detractors, and concerned observers—so much so that it began to attract attention from all corners of the internet. In 2019, Alex Hall, an author and content creator, flew out to Los Angeles to film a documentary on Cantelmo’s extraordinary claims and eclectic lifestyle. However, Hall ultimately chose not to release the footage.
