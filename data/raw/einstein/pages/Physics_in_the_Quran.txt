Some Islamic scholars have suggested that verses in the Quran relate to scientific knowledge otherwise unknown at the time of the Quran's revelation. Some have drawn connections between verses and concepts and theories of modern physics, such as the origin and expansion of the universe to the motion of celestial bodies, the nature of light, effects of atmospheric pressure, and other physical phenomena. Islamic scholars suggest the presence of such knowledge would enhance the status of the Quran as a divine revelation transcending the time and environment in which it was revealed.


== Universe and astronomy ==
In Al-Anbiya: 30, the terms ratq and fataqnā denote that the heavens and the earth were once a single entity before being separated. This has been connected to the Big Bang theory in modern cosmology.
In Adh-Dhariyat: 47,  the active participle lāmūsīʿūn indicates the ongoing expansion of the universe.
Some exegesis of Al-Anbiya: 16 interprets wa-mā baynahumā as indicating that creation is not limited to a single system but includes multiple worlds and universes. The term lāʿibīn ("as play") suggests the wisdom behind creating these diverse realms to demonstrate God’s greatness and precise order.
Al-Anbiya: 33 affirms that all celestial bodies move in precise orbits
In Al-Waqi'a: 75, the oath by "the positions of the stars" highlights their significance in astronomy and celestial navigation.


== Geology ==
In An-Nahl: 15, the term rawāsī refers to earth's stabilizers, interpreted as mountains that function like pegs to secure the crust. This verse has been equated with plate tectonics.
In Al-Inshiqaq: 3, some scholars interpret the word muddat to mean the earth's surface is spread or flattened by natural forces, consistent with geological processes shaping the planet.


== Light ==
Yūnus: 5 distinguishes between ḍiyāʾ (sun's emitted light) and nūr (moon's reflected light)
Some commentators interpret Al-Furqan: 45 as reference to light bending under the sun's gravity, a phenomenon confirmed by the 1919 solar eclipse observations.


== Sound ==
In Fussilat: 73, some scholars associate the term ṣayḥah ("shriek") with high-frequency destructive waves similar to ultrasonic shockwaves.


== Atmospheric pressure ==
In Al-An'am: 125, the description of chest tightness mirrors altitude sickness.


== Iron ==
Some scholars interpret Al-Hadid: 25, and the phrase anzalnā ("We sent down"), as indicating the cosmic origin of iron, synthesized in massive stars and coming to Earth via meteorites.


== Time ==
The verses Al-Hajj: 47, As-Sajdah: 5, and Al-Maarij: 4 suggest that the perception of time varies with divine measurement. Some scholars have equated this with concepts of time dilation in Einstein's theory of relativity. Several scholars interpret these as indications that time is not absolute but relative.
