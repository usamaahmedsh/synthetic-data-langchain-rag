The Provisional World Parliament (PWP) is a transitional international legislative body or a transitional international parliament of the Provisional World Government established by the Second World Constituent Assembly, operating under the constitutional framework of the Constitution for the Federation of Earth. It is intended to serve as part of the process of establishing the world federation called Federation of Earth. It consists of representatives, delegates and observers from around the world and is tasked with drafting legislation, promoting global cooperation, and facilitating the transition to a more integrated global governance structure.

General Assembly and Judge and Vice-president of the International Court of Justice, Zail Singh, the chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and President of India, along with Chief Justices from different countries, including Indian Supreme Court Chief Justice K.

== History ==

The origins of the Provisional World Parliament (PWP) can be traced back to the Peoples' World Convention (1950–51) sponsored by Albert Einstein and other prominent figures such as Gerhard Domagk, Robert Hutchins, Kerstin Hesselgren, John Steinbeck, William Beveridge, Hu Shih, Albert Camus, Toyohiko Kagawa, Yehudi Menuhin, Jacques Maritain, John Boyd Orr, Thomas Mann, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Roberto Rossellini and Hans Thirring and World Constitutional Convention (WCC), also known as the World Constituent Assembly (WCA) or the First World Constituent Assembly, which took place in Interlaken, Switzerland, and Wolfach, Germany, in 1968. Lead by Thane Read, an independent U.S. economist and World Constitution Coordinating Committee (WCCC), the convention aimed to establish a global constitution and democratic federal world government to promote global cooperation and world peace. Notable signatories, including Nobel laureates Albert Szent-Györgyi, Bertrand Russell, and leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Muhammad Ayub Khan, and thousands more supported the call for the convention.
During the convention, over 200 participants from various countries engaged in the drafting of a constitution for a global federal government. Subsequently, the World Committee for a World Constitutional Convention (WCWCC) (later known as the World Constitution and Parliament Association (WCPA)) continued its efforts, organizing a Second World Constituent Assembly in Innsbruck, Austria, in 1977.
During this second assembly, delegates adopted the "Constitution for the Federation of Earth". Following its adoption, the World Constitution and Parliament Association (WCPA) issued a call for ratification, urging nations and individuals to endorse the constitution. The constitution was sent to various entities, including the United Nations, national governments, and educational institutions, seeking their support and cooperation in the ratification process.
The "Constitution for the Federation of Earth" underwent further amendments through subsequent World Constituent Assemblies in 1978-79 and 1991. Additionally, the Provisional World Parliament (PWP) has convened irregularly since 1982, with its most recent session occurring in 2021.

== World Legislative Acts ==
The World Legislative Acts (WLAs) outlined in the "Constitution for the Federation of Earth" are an essential component of the legislative framework established by the Provisional World Parliament (PWP). These acts serve as the means through which the PWP exercises its legislative authority and addresses critical global issues. The constitution envisages a comprehensive range of World Legislative Acts that cover various aspects of global governance. Each act is designed to address specific global challenges and advance the principles of the Constitution. The Provisional World Parliament, in collaboration with experts and representatives from around the world, deliberates and drafts these acts to ensure they align with the constitution's values of justice, sustainability, and equality.


== Visa issues ==
In 1987, during the third Provisional World Parliament, 100 delegates, primarily from India, Sri Lanka, and various African nations, were denied visas by the United States Department of State under section 214(b) of the federal immigration code.
