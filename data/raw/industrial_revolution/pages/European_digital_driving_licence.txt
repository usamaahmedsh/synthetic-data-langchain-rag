The European digital driving licence is a project for a standardised digital driving licence, stored on digital devices like smartphones and valid throughout the European Union and other participating countries.


== History ==

On 21 October 2025, the European Parliament approved the creation of a European digital driving licence with the adoption of Directive (EU) 2025/2205 (also unofficially called the 4th European Driving Licence Directive), according to the internationally recognized ISO standard (ISO/IEC 18013-5) and compatible with the upcoming EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI) in accordance with eIDAS 2.0. This is a standardised European digital driving licence.


=== Preceding digital (mobile) driving licence implementations ===
In July 2019, Norway was the first EU/EEA country to issue a mobile version of its driving licence using a proprietary app on a nationwide basis. This was preceded by limited trial in Finland from 2018-2020. Since then, mobile driving licences have been available in Austria, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Poland, Portugal and Spain. These digital/mobile driving licences all have proprietary implementations and are not valid outside their issuing country, as they are not compliant with the current European driving licence rules before the changes of 2025 come into force.
