Arden-Arcade is a principal locality of the Sacramento–Arden-Arcade–Roseville Metropolitan Statistical Area.


== History ==
The first residents of what would become the Arden-Arcade area were the Nisenan, an indigenous people of the horizon period with their own language, culture, and social order.
The land was originally part of a Mexican land grant deeded to John Sutter, the Rancho del Paso grant was negotiated from the Mexican governor by Sutter. On August 10, 1843 Sutter then deeded the Rancho Del Paso to Eliab and Hiram Grimes and John Sinclair. Samuel Norris was the next owner of Rancho del Paso, then James Haggin. From 1862 to 1905, James Ben Ali Haggin owned the Rancho, where he became known for breeding race horses. One of the horses bred on the Rancho, Ben Ali, won the 12th Kentucky Derby in world record time 1886. To ship his horses, Haggin built a railroad spur from his northern paddocks (approximately where today's Hagginwood Golf Course is) toward the current Union Pacific railroad tracks, northeast of the present-day Capitol City Freeway along the beginnings of Arcade Boulevard. On that site, Haggin's staff built 24 barns with 64 stalls each plus some out buildings. It was there that he would ship his horses mostly to Kentucky, some eventually shipping around the world.
“Arden" most likely comes from the fact that Orlando Robertson, the owner of the Rancho and a developer after Haggin, was originally from Arden Hills, Minnesota. As for “Arcade,” Haggin had located the headquarters alongside the major creek that ran through the Rancho (now off Arcade Boulevard, in the South Hagginwood neighborhood of Northern Sacramento), the place name for which being designated "Arcade," after the "arcade" of the limbs to a string of shade-giving native oak trees there. The remnants of the majestic trees can still be seen though some are dead stumps. (In architecture, an arcade is a number of arches supporting a wall.)
Orlando Robertson was a land speculator who came to Sacramento after he heard about the exceptional lands of the Rancho Del Paso. He bought the Rancho in 1905 for $1.5 million for his Sacramento Colonization Company and laid out the streets and developed the tracts for sale. Robertson chose street names that reflected the inventors of the period: Watt, Edison, Howe, Bell and so on.
By 1916, given the fertile soil and excellent supply of water, Robertson sold the tracts to farming families, many of them Scandinavian immigrants newly off the boat Scandinavian. In fact, the area around Gibbons Park was known as “Little Norway” because so many Norwegian families settled there. Arden-Arcade and neighboring Carmichael were advertised as excellent areas for growing citrus, but olives, nuts and stone fruit were also farmed here. At one time, Arden-Arcade was the hop-growing region of the world.
Among the oldest surviving buildings in the area are the Arden Middle School, built in 1914, and the Del Paso Country Club, from 1919, named for the original Rancho on which it was built. The first residential neighborhoods in the area were constructed in the 1920s and the 1930s, as the city developed over the river, but the real building boom came at the end of World War II.
However, the real current face of Arden-Arcade was built between 1945 and 1970 and represents a middle-class mid-century modern community. There are also large custom-built developments dotted with homes and office complexes. Arden-Arcade features multiple googie architectural structures as well.

Arden-Arcade is served by three major highways. Interstate 80 and the Capital City Freeway are just north of the community and just to the south of the American River (the community's southern border) is U.S. Route 50. Major east-west thoroughfares include El Camino Avenue, Marconi Avenue, Arden Way, Alta Arden Expressway, and Fair Oaks Boulevard. Major north-south thoroughfares include Fulton Avenue, Watt Avenue, Howe Avenue, and Eastern Avenue.
Many of the major arterial streets that criss-cross through Arden-Arcade are named for the major inventors of the Industrial Revolution. It is assumed they were named around 1915 by Orlando Robertson, the main property owner of the historic Rancho Del Paso at the time.

=== Housing ===
Arden-Arcade is one of the most economically and ethnically diverse communities in the Sacramento region. There are neighborhoods along the American River and the American River Parkway with million-dollar homes, including Wilhaggin, Sierra Oaks, Sierra Oaks Vista, Arden Park, Arden Oaks, and areas surrounding the Del Paso Country Club. There are also mid century neighborhoods that encompass the majority of Arden Arcade. Most if not all of these community neighborhoods were built immediately after World War II, some by award-winning architects and developers, Jere Strizek, Streng Brothers and Randolph Parks. Other community wide buildings of note are mid-century modern designed businesses, including the 1961 Country Club Lanes (Powers, Daley and DeRosa), Sam's Hof Brau (one of the few remaining original German Hof Brau Deli's still in operation), the AT&T building (Hertzka and Knowels architects 1963), an original IHOP restaurant building (Nims and Koch architects 1963 — now Guaribaldi's), Weinstocks Lubin (Charles Luckman 1961) at Country Club Plaza, Emigh Hardware, and many more. Modern Arden Arcade was completely built out between the years 1945–1965, the prime mid century period in architecture. El Camino and Watt Avenues, where these buildings reside today, were commonly referred to by the community as Downtown Arden Arcade, and in many respects, remains so even today.
Arden-Arcade is home to one of the longest-running certified farmers' markets in California: the Arden-Arcade Certified Farmers' Market, established in 1983.
A new California governor's mansion built for Ronald Reagan was in Arden-Arcade in 1984 and was sold in 2004 and is a private residence. Governors George Deukmejian, Pete Wilson, and Gray Davis each occupied the house on Lake Wilhaggin Drive in the Wilhaggin area. The house was sold in 2004 after Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger decided not to live there and instead occupied the penthouse at the Hyatt Hotel in Downtown Sacramento when he did not commute back to Brentwood, which he did most nights.

==== Incorporation plans ====
On November 2, 2010, area residents voted on Measure D.[1] The measure was defeated by a margin of 76% to 24%. If approved, the area bounded by Auburn Boulevard on the north, the American River Drive, Ethan Way on the west, and Mission Avenue/Jacob Lane on the east would have become the City of Arden-Arcade. Proponents claimed that the new city would have improved services and created community pride in the City of Arden-Arcade without any new taxes.  Opponents believed that revenue assumptions were risky and, if wrong, could lead to higher taxes.


==== Sacramento annexation study ====
As of August 24, 2010, the City of Sacramento posted on their website that they have no plans to annex Arden-Arcade.[2]. Only the Local Area Formation Commission (LAFCo) has the regulatory authority under state law to approve or disapprove of the annexation of territory by a city (Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act of 2000, California Government Code Section 56000). LAFCo requires cities to keep up their general plan and look at overlapping jurisdictions. In that context, the City of Sacramento has collected information about Arden-Arcade but has not taken any steps toward incorporation, the first of which would be identifying Arden-Arcade as within its sphere of influence.
The City of Sacramento's last annexation of an inhabited area, College Greens, was in the late 1950s. While it discussed interest in Arden-Arcade in the 1960s, the City of Sacramento did not initiate formal steps toward incorporation.
In its analysis of the area as part of its general plan update, city staff noted that Arden-Arcade is "mostly built out" (see Part III of the General Plan, Community Plan and Special Study Areas, Arden-Arcade Community Plan, p. 3-AA-5 at http://www.sacgp.org/). The city has also noted that the area has significant infrastructure needs and the likelihood of community opposition to incorporation.


==== Arden-Arcade Community Planning Council ====
The Arden-Arcade Community Planning Council is a nine-member council that helps make decisions for the community of Arden-Arcade. These nine members are appointed by the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors.


==== Chamber of Commerce ====
The North Sacramento Chamber of Commerce, Greater Arden Chamber of Commerce[3], and Metro Chamber Arden Arcade Council all serve the business community of Arden-Arcade.
