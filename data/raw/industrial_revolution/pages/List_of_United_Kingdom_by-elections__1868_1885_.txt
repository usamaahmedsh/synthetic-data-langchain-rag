This is a list of parliamentary by-elections in the United Kingdom held between 1868 and 1885, with the names of the previous incumbent and the victor in the by-election and their respective parties.  Where seats changed political party at the election, the result is highlighted: light blue for a Conservative gain, orange for a Liberal (including Liberal-Labour and Liberal/Crofter) gain, light green for a Home Government Association (1870–1873), Home Rule League (1873–1882) or Irish Parliamentary Party (from 1882) gain and grey for any other gain.


== Resignations ==
See Resignation from the British House of Commons for more details.
Where the cause of by-election is given as "resignation" or "seeks re-election", this indicates that the incumbent was appointed on his own request to an "office of profit under the Crown", either the Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Steward of the Manor of Northstead.  These appointments are made as a constitutional device for leaving the House of Commons, whose Members are not permitted to resign.
