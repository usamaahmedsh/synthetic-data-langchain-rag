=== Early life ===
William Harvey was born in Whittington, Derbyshire, in 1787, the son of a yeoman. Harvey had six siblings including Martha, who later married their cousin Joseph Brotherton and authored the first vegetarian cookbook. His niece was Helen Brotherton. Harvey moved to Salford in 1804 to apprentice under Mr. Railton for cotton spinning, weaving, and printing, and resided with Brotherton.


=== Bible Christian Church ===
The Bible Christian Church in King Street, Salford, was central to Harvey's life. He helped found it and served as deacon from 1809 until his death in 1870. Harvey was a committed advocate of the church's principles, including abstaining from meat, alcohol, and tobacco.


=== Career in cotton industry ===
In 1810, Harvey partnered with his cousins, Joseph and William Brotherton, as cotton spinners. After Joseph's retirement and William's death in 1819, the company passed to Harvey, who then partnered with Charles Tysoe, a fellow Bible Christian Church member, forming Harvey, Tysoe and Co. Their mill, Brotherton Mill, was located on Canal Street, Oldfield Road. The Christian principles they followed—welfare, no child labour under 13, and a 10-hour maximum workday—were praised in Angus Bethune Reach's Manchester and the Textile Districts in 1849. Harvey's sons and grandsons later joined the business.
