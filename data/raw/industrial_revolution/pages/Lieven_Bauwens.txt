Lieven Bauwens (14 June 1769 in Ghent – 17 March 1822 in Paris) was an entrepreneur and industrial spy from the Austrian Netherlands. He was sent to Great Britain at a young age and brought a spinning mule and skilled workers to the European continent.
He started textile plants in Paris (1799) and Ghent (1800). In Ghent he was also mayor for one year. As a leading industrial, he was visited by Napoleon in 1810 and awarded the Legion d'Honneur.
In 1801, Bauwens smuggled a spinning mule and steam engine out of Great Britain to help set up the textile industry in Flanders.
The spinning mule that was brought to Ghent can still be visited, in the Museum of Industry (Ghent) .
