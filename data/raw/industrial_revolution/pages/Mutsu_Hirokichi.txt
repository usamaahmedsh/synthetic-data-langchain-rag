He was sent to the U.K. to study in 1887 as a barrister and by 1895 was appointed to diplomatic positions, residing in London, Washington, DC and Rome. While in Europe he met Gertrude Ethel Passingham whom he later married in 1905. She took the Japanese name Mutsu Iso and followed him back to Japan 1910 where she created a name for herself as a writer.
