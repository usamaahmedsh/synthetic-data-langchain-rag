John M. Hollway (1841 – 1907) was an English metallurgist and chemist who, in the 1870s, unsuccessfully tried out smelting and refining of copper using a converter based on the Bessemer process.
Although his attempts failed, conceding to the French engineers Pierre Manhès and Paul David, the honor of the invention of the Manhès-David process in 1880, the abundant communication he made on his failures constitute a significant contribution to the development and perfecting their process.
