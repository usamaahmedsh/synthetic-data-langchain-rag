Jean Beausire (French pronunciation: [ʒɑ̃ boziʁ]; 26 February 1651 - 20 March 1743) was an architect, engineer and fountain-maker and the chief of public works in Paris for King Louis XIV of France and King Louis XV of France between 1684 and 1740,  and was the architect of all the public fountains constructed in Paris that period.  Several of his fountains still exist and continue to work.  Three streets in the 4th arrondissement of Paris today carry his name:  Rue Jean-Beausire, Impasse Jean-Beausire, and Passage Jean-Beausire.


== Biography ==

Jean Beausire was born on 26 February 1651. His father was a stonemason, and the family lived in the St. Severin quarter of Paris.  He married Marie Roman in 1670, and they had eight sons, one of whom, Pierre, born in 1673, also became a fountain-maker.  Five of the sons died prematurely, and the other two sons went into the church.
Marie Roman died in 1679, and the following year Beausire remarried to Marie-Catherine Le Trotteur, the daughter of a wealthy merchant.  They had nineteen children, many of whom became part of his fountain workshop.
In 1681, he began working on royal construction projects, including the gates of the Palais Royale, and the reconstruction of the fontaine Sainte-Avoye.   In 1683, with the help of his wealthy father-in-law, he  purchased the title of Master of Masonry Works of the City of Paris.   In 1690,  he received the additional title from Louis XIV  of controller of public works of Paris. (contrôleur des bâtiments de la Ville).  In 1706 he was given a new title, Maître Général, Contrôleur et inspecteur des bâtiments, in charge of all the fountains in Paris.  He had to pay 50,000 livres for this new post, but it entitled him to an annual income of 2500 livres in fees and 2500 in appointments.
Beausire was extremely active in his post.  Among his projects was the transformation of the old walls of the city into parks planted with trees (1670); installing a statue of Louis XIV in front of the Hotel de Ville (1689);  the development of Place Vendôme and Place des Victoires;  building a barracks for the royal Musketeers on rue Chareton; rebuilding the Petit Pont after it burned (1718-1719), and  creating a whole new neighborhood between the rue des Filles-du-Calvaire and the rue du Temple.
Jean Beausire was received as a member of the Académie Royale d'Architecture in 1716.
The many children of Beausire entered into marriages with prominent architects and families, creating a whole dynasty of architects.  For instance, in 1717 his daughter Catherine-Elisabeth Beausire married Barthélémy Bourdet, one of the most successful architects in Paris.    His son Jean-Baptiste-Augustin Beausire, became a prominent architect and assumed his father's official titles, and his grandson, Pierre-Louis Moreau, was the last municipal architect of the Old Regime, and died under the guillotine during the French Revolution on 9 July 1794. 

The grandson of Jean Beausire, Simon Beausire (Paris 1648-1712 Rome) in Rome in 1683 he married Angela di Bartolomeo Manzoni and were born the landscape artist Giovanni Battista Busiri (Rome 1698-1757) and Giulio Busiri (Rome 1687-1764); Giulio is the forefather of today's architects Busiri Vici (Rome-Italy).
