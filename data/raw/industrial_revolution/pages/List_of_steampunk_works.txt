Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction, fantasy and speculative fiction that came into prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s. The term denotes works set in an era or world wherein steam power is still widely used—usually the 19th century, and often set in Victorian era England—but with prominent elements of either science fiction or fantasy, such as fictional technological inventions like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, or real technological developments like the computer occurring at an earlier date. Other examples of steampunk contain alternate history-style presentations of "the path not taken" of such technology as dirigibles or analog computers; these frequently are presented in an idealized light, or with a presumption of functionality.
Although many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s, the term "steampunk" originated in the late 1980s, as a tongue-in-cheek variant of cyberpunk.
This article is a list of works in the science fiction and fantasy genres considered by commentators to be steampunk.


== Precursors ==
Although the term "steampunk" was not coined until 1987, several works of fiction significant to the development of the genre were produced before that. For example, Mervyn Peake's novel Titus Alone (1959) anticipated many of the tropes of steampunk. Steampunk elements have also consistently appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s, dating back to Osamu Tezuka's epic science-fiction trilogy consisting of Lost World (1948), Metropolis (1949) and Nextworld (1951).
Steampunk was particularly influenced by, and often adopts the style of the scientific romances and fantasies of the 19th century. Notably influential authors are:

G. K. Chesterton
Charles Dickens
Arthur Conan Doyle
George Griffith
H. P. Lovecraft
Albert Robida
Mary Shelley
Robert Louis Stevenson
Bram Stoker
Mark Twain
Jules Verne
H. G. Wells
Early adaptations of this scientific romance literature genre to film, particularly those from the 1950s and 1960s, are notable precursors of steampunk cinema:

20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954)
From the Earth to the Moon (1958)
Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959)
The Time Machine (1960)
Master of the World (1961)
First Men in the Moon (1964)
Captain Nemo and the Underwater City (1969)
