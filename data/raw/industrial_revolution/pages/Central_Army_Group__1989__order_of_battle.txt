The Central Army Group (CENTAG) was a NATO military formation comprising four Army Corps from two NATO member nations comprising troops from Canada, West Germany and the United States. During the Cold War, CENTAG was NATO's forward defence in the southern half of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). The northern half of the FRG was defended by the four Army Corps of NATO's Northern Army Group (NORTHAG). During wartime, CENTAG would command four frontline corps (II German, III German, V US, and VII US). Air support was provided by Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force.
In addition to these forces, the French Forces in Germany (made up of the 1st Army Corps and 2nd Army Corps) were associated with the Army Group. In 1966, France had withdrawn from the NATO Command Structure, but it still wished to take part in the defence of Western Europe. A series of secret US-French agreements, the Lemnitzer-Ailleret Agreements, made between NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the French Chief of the Defence Staff detailed how French forces would reintegrate into the NATO Command Structure in case of war. Three armored divisions of the First Army were based within Germany and held yearly maneuvers with their allies to train for the moment French units would be committed to CENTAG (see also: Structure of the French Army in 1989).
The estimated wartime structure of CENTAG in the fall of 1989 at the end of the Cold War follows below. The main source for U.S. entries is Johnson, Andy; Callahan, Pat (2012). NATO Order of Battle 1989.


== 56th Field Artillery Command ==
The 56th Field Artillery Command was organized to always report directly to the highest commander in Europe at the time. Therefore, during peacetime, it reported to the United States Army Europe, whereas, during heightened tension or war, command passed to NATO, with Allied Air Forces Central Europe as the next higher headquarters. The Pershing systems were eliminated after the ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on 27 May 1988. The missiles began to be withdrawn in October 1988 and the last of the missiles were destroyed by the static burn of their motors and subsequently crushed in May 1991 at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant near Caddo Lake, Texas.

note 1: In case of war approximately 1,400 men from 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group would have been sent to Germany to bring 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group to full wartime strength.
note 2: Each of 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group's mechanized battalions fielded the following equipment: 2 × M577, 65 × M113, 11 × Lynx, 18 × M113 TUA with TOW, 24 × M125 with a 81mm mortar.
note 3: This brigade had formed the Canadian Air-Sea Transportable Brigade Group and would in wartime have supported NATO forces in Norway. In case of war, Canada thus would have had to support one brigade each in two far apart theatres of war. In 1987, the Canadian government therefore decided to make 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group a wartime support for the German theatre, bringing its contribution there to division strength.
