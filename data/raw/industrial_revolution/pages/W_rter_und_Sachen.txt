Wörter und Sachen (German for words and things) was a philological movement of the early 20th century that was based largely in Germany and Austria. It is a descriptive research field for linguistic and factual research, which was first presented by R. Mehringer "Wörter und Sachen", Indogermanische Forschungen 17 (1904/1905). Further results were presented in the cultural-historical journal of the same name (Heidelberg 1909 ff.), in English in Th. Bynon, Historical Linguistics. Cambridge 1977. 
Its proponents argued that the etymology of words should be studied in close association or in parallel with the study of the artefacts and cultural concepts which the words had denoted. The process would, it was argued, enable researchers to study linguistic data more effectively.
Many of the principles and the theories of the Wörter und Sachen movement have since been incorporated into modern historical linguistics such as the practice of cross-referencing with archaeological data.
