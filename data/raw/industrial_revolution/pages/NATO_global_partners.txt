NATO global partners, or partners across the globe are countries that cooperate with NATO on a regular basis, but are unable to join the alliance due to Article 10 restricting countries eligible to join the alliance to those in Europe.
Global partners are on the same level as countries with an Individual Partnership Action Plan, with regards to working side by side with NATO member states on "a range of common cross-cutting security challenges such as cyber defense, counter-terrorism, non-proliferation and resilience". Many global partners of NATO are also major non-NATO allies of the United States. These countries cooperate closely with the United States Armed Forces and benefit from other military and financial advantages.
