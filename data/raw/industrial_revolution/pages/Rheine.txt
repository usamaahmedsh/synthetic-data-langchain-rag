== History ==


=== Early history ===
Although the region around the city has been populated since prehistoric times, Rheine was first mentioned in a document signed by Louis the Pious in 838. On 15 August 1327, it received its town charter from Louis II, Bishop of Münster.
The settlement was near to the crossing of two old merchant roads and a ford over the river Ems. Frankish soldiers initially secured this strategic point with a barrack yard. Later a church and more buildings were added to this outpost.


=== 17th – 19th centuries ===
At the end of the Thirty Years' War the city was burned down almost completely. Swedish and Hessian troops besieged imperial soldiers who had entrenched themselves in Rheine. On 20/21 September and 19 October 1647 glowing cannonballs set fire to the city and 365 houses were destroyed. In 1803 the city became the capital of the Sovereign Principality of Rheina-Wolbeck (556 square kilometers) of the House of Looz-Corswarem, later annexed by the Grand Duchy of Berg and the Kingdom of Prussia.
During the Industrial Revolution the textile industry prospered.  It remained an important economic factor until the second half of the 20th century. Today engineering industries and services form the largest part of economy in Rheine.


=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
On 1 April 1927 about 10,000 inhabitants of the Office Rheine (Bentlage, Wadelheim, Dutum, etc.) were incorporated into the city, the population increased to 29,598, the city area was thus tripled.
During Nazi rule of Germany, Jewish citizens were deported from Rheine, as elsewhere in Germany. In the Second World War, Allied forces bombarded the city repeatedly, especially the railway line and the Dortmund-Ems Canal, which represented tactical goals. Large-scale bombing raids occurred on 5 October 1944 and 21 March 1945, each leaving more than 200 dead and causing extensive damage to the city area. The conquest of Rheine took place on 2 April 1945 after some fierce fighting by units of the 157th British Infantry Brigade (5th Battalion of the King's Own Scottish Borderers Regiment, 7th Battalion of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) Regiment).
After 1945, Rheine was in the British occupation zone and 1946 was politically assigned to the newly founded Land (state) of North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1949 it joined with the other states in the Western Zone to form the Federal Republic of Germany.
On 10 February 1946 Rheine was affected by the highest ever Emshochwasser. Large parts of the city were flooded.
On 15 August 2002 the city celebrated the 675th anniversary of the granting of municipal law.
