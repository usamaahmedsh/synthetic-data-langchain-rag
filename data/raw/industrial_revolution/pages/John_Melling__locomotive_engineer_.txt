Melling was born in 1782.
In 1833 the L&MR's first locomotive foreman was sacked for gross misconduct, and Melling was appointed to the twin roles of Superintendent of the Engine Shops and Locomotive Foreman.

In December 1839 Melling was given notice to quit within three months, with John Dewrance appointed "Locomotive Superintendent and Foreman of the Engine Shops" in January 1840. Upon leaving Melling and son Thomas were to establish Rainlhill Iron Works.
Melling died in 1856.
