Nichirenism (日蓮主義, Nichirenshugi) is the nationalistic interpretation of the teachings of Nichiren. The most well-known representatives of this form of Nichiren Buddhism are Nissho Inoue and Tanaka Chigaku, who construed Nichiren's teachings according to the notion of Kokutai. It was especially Chigaku who "made innovative use of print media to disseminate his message" and is therefore regarded to have influenced Nichiren-based Japanese new religions in terms of methods of propagation.
