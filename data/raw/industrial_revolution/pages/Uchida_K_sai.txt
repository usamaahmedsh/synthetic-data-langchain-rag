Uchida was born in what is now Yatsushiro, Kumamoto Prefecture, as the son of the domain's doctor. After studying English for two years at Doshisha University, Uchida moved to Tokyo Imperial University, graduating from its law school.
After graduation, Uchida entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and served as ambassador to Qing dynasty China, then as ambassador to Austria-Hungary, and then to the United States. He served as Japanese foreign minister from 1911 to 1912 under the 2nd Saionji Kinmochi administration.
Appointed as ambassador to the Empire of Russia just before the Bolshevik Revolution, Uchida returned to Japan to serve as Foreign Minister again from 1918 to 1923 under the Hara, Takahashi, and Katō administrations.
