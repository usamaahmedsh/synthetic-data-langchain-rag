John Muller (1699 – June 1784) was a mathematician and engineer from the Holy Roman Empire.


== Life ==
Born Johann Müller in the Holy Roman Empire, he moved to London in 1736.
In 1741 he was appointed deputy head of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he performed all the teaching duties of Martin Folkes. He transformed the institution into a disciplined cadet academy with the help of Thomas Simpson. In 1754 he became first master of the Academy, after Folkes's death. He was later appointed Professor of Artillery and Fortification (and "Preceptor of Engineering, etc. to his Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester"); he retired in 1766. During his time at the Academy Muller carried out gunnery experiments with Colonel Desaguliers, described in the second edition of A Treatise of Artillery.
Muller married Mary Horn on 29 December 1774, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. He died at his home in Eaton Street (now Greet Street), London in June 1784. The contents of his library were auctioned at the Military Library, Whitehall early in 1785.
Muller’s works were concerned with mathematics and fortification. At the Academy there were strict instructions on which topics each instructor was to teach, which included a list of works to be used; several of Muller's books were his included.
