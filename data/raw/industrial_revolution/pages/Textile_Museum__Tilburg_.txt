The Textile Museum is a museum dedicated to the art of textiles in the city of Tilburg in the Dutch province, North Brabant. The museum was opened in 1958 in a former villa related to the factory, and since 1985 has been based in the former factory of the firm C. Mommers & Co., once one of the largest employers in Tilburg. In 2008, the museum was re-opened after a complete renovation.
