This list of mills in Bolton lists textile factories which existed at one time or another in the Borough of Bolton, Greater Manchester, England.
From the Industrial Revolution until the 20th century, Bolton was a major centre of textile manufacture, particularly cotton spinning. During this period, Bolton was dominated by large rectangular brick-built factories, many of which still remain today as warehouses or converted for residential or retail use. In 1929 there were 247 cotton mills in the borough and in 2009 a study revealed that 108 had survived in some form. The others had been totally demolished and their sites used for other purposes.
163 mills are listed below according to the Bolton ward in which they stand or once stood. The great majority of the premises listed represent spinning mills, the remainder weaving sheds.
