The INTERREG IV France-Wallonie-Vlaanderen Programme 2007–2013, which is co-financed by the European Union, aims at intensifying the cooperation in a cross-border area of 62,000 km2 with around 10.5 million inhabitants: the provinces Hainaut, Namur, Luxembourg, Western Flanders and Eastern Flanders in Belgium and the departments Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Aisne and Ardennes in France.

The total budget of the INTERREG IV France-Wallonie-Vlaanderen Programme amounts to 276 million Euros, 50% of which financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund. The balance is taken care of by the operators and the regional or territorial institutions concerned. On 30 June 2010, 83% of the European funds were already invested. The Steering Committees indeed approved over 140 projects, which are co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund up to 114 million Euros.
