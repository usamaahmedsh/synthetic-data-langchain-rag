The ATLAS network is an association of law enforcement special intervention units from the 27 Member States of the European Union and associated countries. It was established following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, on the initiative of the European Police Chiefs Task Force (EPCTF). Together, these top-tier units maintain a constant state of readiness, poised to respond to any security crisis in Europe at any time.


== History ==
ATLAS was initially informally established for information exchange and training activities co-operation between units. It was later formalised by a decision of the Council of the European Union in 2008, which also expanded ATLAS's functions to include the provision of assistance upon request to another Member State.
In 2018, an ATLAS Support Office was established within Europol's European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) in The Hague, Netherlands, thereby strengthening the role of the ATLAS Network within European law enforcement organisations.


== Terms ==
ATLAS uses the terms 'special intervention unit' and 'crisis situation' defined as follows: 

'Special intervention unit' refers to any law enforcement unit of a Member State that is specialised in controlling a crisis situation.
'Crisis situation' refers to any situation in which the competent authorities of a Member State have reasonable grounds to believe that there is a criminal offence presenting a serious direct physical threat to persons, property, infrastructure, or institutions in that Member State, particularly in situations combating terrorism.


== Organization ==
ATLAS recognises that a Member State may not have the means, resources, or expertise to handle all crisis situations, particularly large crises. It provides a framework for a Member State to request assistance from another Member State.


== Members ==
ATLAS consists of 38 special intervention units, including units from non-EU Member States such as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and the United Kingdom. The non-EU Member States can participate and use of all facilities, but they do not have voting rights:
