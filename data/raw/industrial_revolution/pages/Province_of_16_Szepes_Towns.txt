== History ==
On 5 June 1778, Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary, had confirmed old privileges of the towns of the Province of 13 Szepes Towns, and re-established their autonomy. It was unified with the Dominion of Lubowla, forming the Province of 16 Szepes Towns, with Spišská Nová Ves as its capital.
The province was disestablished on 1 November 1785, in the effect of the Josephine reforms, done under the rule of Joseph II. The towns lost their autonomy and were given back under the direct administration of Szepes County. It was reestablished back in October 1791, after the reforms were abolished.
In 1849, the Provincial Count was appointed as the Government Commissioner, de jure, turning the province into the Government Commissariat of 16 Towns. It got disestablished in 1876, during the period of Bach's absolutism. The towns lost their autonomy and were given back under the direct administration of Szepes County.
