In chemistry and biochemistry, the pH of weakly acidic chemical solutions 
can be estimated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:

                  Base
                
                ]
              
              
                [
                
                  Acid
                
                ]
              
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\ce {pH}}={\ce {p}}K_{{\ce {a}}}+\log _{10}\left({\frac {[{\ce {Base}}]}{[{\ce {Acid}}]}}\right)}
  
  
The equation relates the pH of the weak acid to the numerical value of the acid dissociation constant, Ka, of the acid, and the ratio of the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is often used for estimating the pH of buffer solutions by approximating the actual concentration ratio as the ratio of the analytical concentrations of the acid and of a salt, MA. It is also useful for determining the volumes of the reagents needed before preparing buffer solutions, which prevents unnecessary waste of chemical reagents that may need to be further neutralized by even more reagents before they are safe to expose.
For example, the acid may be carbonic acid

  
    
      
        
          
            HCO

The equation can also be applied to bases by specifying the protonated form of the base as the acid. For example, with an amine, 
  
    
      
        
          R
          N

    {\displaystyle \mathrm {RNH_{2}} }
  

  
    
      
        
          R
          N
          
            H
            
              3
            
            
              +
            
          
          ⇋
          R
          N
          
            H
            
              2
            
          
          +
          
            H
            
              +
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {RNH_{3}^{+}\leftrightharpoons RNH_{2}+H^{+}} }
  

The Henderson–Hasselbalch buffer system also has many natural and biological applications, from physiological processes (e.g., metabolic acidosis) to geological phenomena.


== History ==
The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation was developed by Lawrence Joseph Henderson and Karl Albert Hasselbalch. Henderson was a biological chemist and Hasselbalch was a physiologist who studied pH.
In 1908, Henderson derived an equation to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration of a bicarbonate buffer solution, which rearranged looks like this:

In 1909 Sørensen introduced the pH terminology, which allowed Hasselbalch to re-express Henderson's equation in logarithmic terms, resulting in the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation.


== Assumptions, limitations, and derivation ==
A simple buffer solution consists of a solution of an acid and a salt of the conjugate base of the acid. For example, the acid may be acetic acid and the salt may be sodium acetate. The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a solution containing a mixture of the two components to the acid dissociation constant, Ka of the acid, and the concentrations of the species in solution. 

To derive the equation a number of simplifying assumptions have to be made.
Assumption 1: The acid, HA, is monobasic and dissociates according to the equations

CA is the analytical concentration of the acid and CH is the concentration the hydrogen ion that has been added to the solution. The self-dissociation of water is ignored. A quantity in square brackets, [X], represents the concentration of the chemical substance X. It is understood that the symbol H+ stands for the hydrated hydronium ion. Ka is an acid dissociation constant.
The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation can be applied to a polybasic acid only if its consecutive pK values differ by at least 3. Phosphoric acid is such an acid.
Assumption 2. The self-ionization of water can be ignored. This assumption is not, strictly speaking, valid with pH values close to 7, half the value of pKw, the constant for self-ionization of water. In this case the mass-balance equation for hydrogen should be extended to take account of the self-ionization of water.

the concentration of the sodium ion, [Na+] can be ignored. This is a good approximation for 1:1 electrolytes, but not for salts of ions that have a higher charge such as magnesium sulphate, MgSO4, that form ion pairs.

== Application to bases ==
The equilibrium constant for the protonation of a base, B, 

B(base) + H+ ⇌ BH+(acid)
is an association constant, Kb, which is simply related to the dissociation constant of the conjugate acid, BH+.

 is necessary. For example, a decreased blood pH will trigger the brain stem to perform more frequent respiration. The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation can be used to model these equilibria. It is important to maintain this pH of 7.4 to ensure enzymes are able to work optimally.
Life threatening Acidosis (a low blood pH resulting in nausea, headaches, and even coma, and convulsions) is due to a lack of functioning of enzymes at a low pH. As modelled by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, in severe cases this can be reversed by administering intravenous bicarbonate solution. If the partial pressure of

    {\displaystyle \mathrm {CO_{2}(g)} }
  
 does not change, this addition of bicarbonate solution will raise the blood pH.


== Natural buffers ==
The ocean contains a natural buffer system to maintain a pH between 8.1 and 8.3. The ocean buffer system is known as the carbonate buffer system. The carbonate buffer system is a series of reactions that uses carbonate as a buffer to convert

 into bicarbonate. The carbonate buffer reaction helps maintain a constant H+ concentration in the ocean because it consumes hydrogen ions, and thereby maintains a constant pH. The ocean has been experiencing ocean acidification due to humans' increasing

 reacts with water and produces carbonic acid, and carbonic acid releases H+ ions and bicarbonate ions. Overall, since the Industrial Revolution the ocean has experienced a pH decrease of about 0.1 pH units due to the increase in

  production.
Ocean acidification affects marine life that have shells that are made up of carbonate. In a more acidic environment, it is harder for organisms to grow and maintain the carbonate shells. The increase in ocean acidity can cause carbonate shell organisms to experience reduced growth and reproduction.
