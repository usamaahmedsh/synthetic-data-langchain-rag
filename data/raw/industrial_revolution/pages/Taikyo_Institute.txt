The Taikyo Institute (大教院, Taikyōin or Daikyōin; Lit. "Great Doctrine Institute") was an organization under the Ministry of Religion in the Empire of Japan.


== History ==
It was founded in 1872 to train kyōdo shōku or religious teachers because the Missionary Office and Department of Divinities were unsuccessful in their national indoctrination objectives. It was intended as a joint Shinto and Buddhist organization, but ended up becoming entirely dominated by Shinto.
Chūkyōin (中教院; "Middle Doctrine Academies") were established in each prefectural capital and Shōkyoin (小教院; "Minor Doctrine Academies") were established in various cities.
On January 1, 1875, an arson attack on the Taikyo Institute caused confusion, with four Jōdo Shinshū sects informally announcing their departure from the Great Teaching Institute.
On May 3, 1875, the Taikyo Institute was dissolved by the Ministry of Religion and replaced with the Bureau of Shinto Affairs and later Shintō Taikyō.
Ame-no-Minakanushi was one of its patron deities, also known under the Buddhist name Myōken.
