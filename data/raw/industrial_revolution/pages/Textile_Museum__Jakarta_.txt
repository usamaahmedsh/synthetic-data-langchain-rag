== History ==
The Textile Museum building was constructed in the early 19th century. Initially it was a private house of a Frenchman. The building was later sold to Abdul Aziz Al Mussawi al Musa Khadim, a Turkish consul for Batavia. In 1942, the building was sold again to Karel Cristian Cruq.
The building had been used as the headquarters of Barisan Keamanan Rakyat ("Front of People's Safety") during the struggle for independence period. In 1947  it was owned by Lie Sion Phin who rented it to the Department of Social Affairs which modified it into an institution for elderly people. Afterwards the building was handed over to the city's government.
On July 28, 1976, it was inaugurated as the Textile Museum by Madame Tien Soeharto.
