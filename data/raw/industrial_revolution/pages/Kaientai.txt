The Kaientai (海援隊, Kaientai; "Maritime Support Force") was a trading and shipping company and private navy, considered to be the first corporation in modern Japan.
Kaientai, originally named Kameyama Shachū (亀山社中, "Kameyama Troupe"), was founded by Sakamoto Ryōma in Nagasaki in 1865 during the Bakumatsu, and it was initially funded by the Satsuma Domain and other groups and domains.
The logo of SoftBank Group is based on the idea of a "21st century Kaientai".
