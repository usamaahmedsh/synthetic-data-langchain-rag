== Biography ==
Hotta Masatsugu was the son of Hotta Masamoto, but as his father died young, he succeeded his grandfather, Hotta Masahira as daimyō of Sano. Despite his young age, he had good political acumen and capable advisors. He is noted for opening a han school. He was received in formal audience by Shogun Tokugawa Iesada in 1857. In 1868, he declared for the new Meiji government and supplied weapons to the new armies fighting to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate. He was received by Emperor Meiji later that year, and in 1869 was appointed imperial governor of Sano.
After the Meiji Restoration, with the abolition of the han system in 1871 he relocated to Tokyo. In 1884, he was raised to the kazoku peerage title of shishaku (viscount).
