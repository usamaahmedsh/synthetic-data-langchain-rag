Prince Yamashina Kikumaro (山階宮 菊麿王, Yamashina-no-miya Kikumaro-ō; 3 July 1873 – 2 May 1908), was the second head of the Yamashina-no-miya, a collateral line of the Japanese imperial family.


== Early life ==
Prince Yamashina Kikumaro was the son of Prince Yamashina Akira. His mother was a concubine, Nakajo Chieko, but as Prince Akira had no children by his official wife, Princess Katsura Sumiko (the half-sister of Emperor Kōmei), Kikumaro was adopted as his official heir.
However, in 1880, he was adopted by Prince Nashimoto Moriosa to carry on the Nashimoto line. However, following Prince Moriosa's death, the Nashimoto line passed to Prince Kuni Morimasa, and Prince Kikumaro was able to return as heir to the Yamashina line. On 2 February 1898, he succeeded his father as the second head of the Yamashina-no-miya house.


== Military career ==
Prince Yamashina Kikumaro attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy and received a commission as a sub-lieutenant in 1894. He served his midshipman duties on the Iwate, followed by a tour of duty aboard the Yakumo from 1902. He served in combat with distinction during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, and was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite (4th class). By 1905, he was promoted to the rank of captain. He entered the Naval Staff College in January 1908, but died suddenly four months later at the young age of 34.
