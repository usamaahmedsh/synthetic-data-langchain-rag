The borders of Greece have changed nine times since the Protocol of London on March 22, 1829 until the accession of the Dodecanese in 1947.


== First borders of independent Greece ==
The Poros Conference in 1828, immediately after the Battle of Navarino, had the primary task of delineating the future borders of the Greek state. John Capodistria presents two plans for the land border:

Arta–Volos line and 3.5 km north of the Gulf of Arta
The Haliacmon–Metsovo–Ionian Sea line (Haliacmon–Aoös line)
According to the London Protocol (1829), the land border to the north is established on the Arta–Volos line. The British strongly opposed the border in western Greece due to their interest in keeping the mainland opposite the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands away from Greek hands, lest it encourage irredentionist aspirations in the islands. The subsequent London Protocol (1830), however, returned the land border to the Aspropotamos–Spercheios line.
The Treaty of Constantinople (1832), confirmed at the London Conference of 1832 establishing the new land border of the Kingdom of Greece finally on the Arta–Volos line.

The Greek gains are recognized by the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Athens on 14 November 1913.
