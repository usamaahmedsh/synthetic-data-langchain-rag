Historical Village of Hokkaido (北海道開拓の村, Hokkaidō Kaitaku no Mura) is an open-air museum in Sapporo, Hokkaidō, Japan. It opened in the Nopporo Shinrin Kōen Prefectural Natural Park in 1983. It includes fifty-two historical structures from the "frontier days" of the Meiji era to the Shōwa era that have been relocated and reconstructed or recreated, divided into four zones: town (with thirty-one buildings), fishing village (four buildings), farming village (fourteen buildings), and mountain village (three buildings). The museum is notable for having a rare 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow gauge horse-drawn tramway.
