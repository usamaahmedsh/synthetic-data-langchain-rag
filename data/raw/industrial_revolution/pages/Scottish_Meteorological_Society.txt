The Scottish Meteorological Society was founded in 1855 by David Milne-Home with private funding, particularly from wealthy landowners who wished to compile meteorological records in order to improve agriculture.
The Society founded the observatory on Ben Nevis, officially opened in 1883.
In 1921, the Society amalgamated with the Royal Meteorological Society.
