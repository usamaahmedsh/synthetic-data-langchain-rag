Hamao Arata was born on 12 May 1849 to a samurai family of the Toyooka Domain in Tajima Province. After the Meiji Restoration, he studied at the Keio Gijuku. He entered the Ministry of Education in 1872, before being sent to study in the United States for a year. After returning to Japan he served as a school principal.
The University of Tokyo, then simply the Imperial University, was founded in 1877, and Hamao became an assistant professor, becoming the right-hand man to its first president Katō Hiroyuki, his countryman from Tajima Province. Hamao later became chief of the Specialised Education Bureau in the Ministry of Education.

In March 1893, Hamao was appointed president of the Imperial University on Katō's recommendation. During his tenure the university changed its name to Tokyo Imperial University due to the foundation of Kyoto Imperial University in 1897. In November of the same year Hamao was appointed Minister of Education in the Second Matsukata Cabinet, serving until the cabinet resigned in January 1898. He was reappointed president of Tokyo Imperial University in 1905. He was ennobled as a baron on 23 September 1907 and appointed to the privy council in 1911. In 1912, he stepped down as university president.
In 1914, he was appointed Grand Master of Crown Prince's Household (東宮大夫, Togu no Daibu). As such he supervised the education of the young Crown Prince Hirohito, concurrently serving as vice president of the palace school established especially for his education, with the revered Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō as president. Hamao opposed the plan to have the Crown Prince undertake a European tour. Hamao was removed from his position in November 1921. At the same time he was elevated to viscount in the nobility.
Hamao became vice president of the Privy Council in 1922 and was promoted to president two years later. Hamao exercised the functions of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan after the resignation of Hirata Tosuke, before Makino Nobuaki was appointed on the same day. He died on 25 September 1925
