This timeline of clothing and textiles technology covers events relating to fiber and flexible woven material worn on the body. This includes the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, and manufacturing systems (technology).


== Fibers and fabrics ==

Research remains ongoing as to when people started wearing clothes.
c. 50,000 BC – A discovered twisted fibre (a 3-ply cord fragment) indicates the likely use of clothing, bags, nets and similar technology by Neanderthals in southeastern France.
c. 27000 BC – Impressions of textiles, basketry, and nets left on small pieces of hard clay in Europe.
c. 25000 BC – Venus figurines depicted with clothing.

c. 1988 BC – Production of linen cloth in Ancient Egypt, along with other bast fibers including rush, reed, palm, and papyrus.
c. 1000 BC – Cherchen Man was laid to rest with a twill tunic and the earliest known sample of tartan fabric.
c. 200 AD – Earliest woodblock printing from China. Flowers in three colors on silk.
247 AD – Dura-Europos, a Roman outpost, is destroyed. Excavations of the city discovered early examples of naalebinding fabric.
11th century – Broadcloth first produced in the Duchy of Brabant (now Flanders).
1275 – Approximate date of a silk burial cushion knit in two colors found in the tomb of Spanish royalty.
1493 – The first available reference to lace is in a will by one of the ruling Milanese Sforza family.

== Tools and machines ==


=== Ancient and prehistoric ===

c. 28000 BC – Sewing needles in use at Kostenki in Russia.
c. 6500 BC – Approximate date of Naalebinding examples found in Nahal Hemar Cave, Israel. This technique, which uses short separate lengths of thread, predated the invention of knitting (with its continuous lengths of thread) and requires that all of the as-yet unused thread be pulled through the loop in the sewn material. This requires much greater skill than knitting in order to create a fine product.
4200 BC – Date of Mesolithic examples of Naalebinding found in Denmark, marking spread of technology to Northern Europe.
200 BC to 200 AD – Approximate date of earliest evidence of "Needle Knitting" in Peru, a form of Naalebinding that preceded local contact with the Spanish.
