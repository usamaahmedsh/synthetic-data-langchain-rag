Electric Bob is a fictional science fiction dime novel character created by Robert T. Toombs. In the strips, Electric Bob's real name is Robert Morse and he is depicted as a descendant of a telegraph inventor named Samuel. He appears in a series of five novels in New York Five Cent Library published by Street & Smith. The character Electric Bob was a 10-year-old engineering genius and wealthy from inheritance. He is in the mold of boy inventors Frank Reade and Jack Wright, although not nearly as popular. The author's name is believed to be a pseudonym and little is known about who was behind the strip.
Electric Bob appeared in five novels beginning with "Electric Bob and His White Alligator" in issue 50, July 22, 1893. His inventions include an amphibious mechanical alligator, a flying hawk, a giant ostrich, a camel and a submarine.
