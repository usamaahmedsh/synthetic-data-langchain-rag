The name Hyde is derived from the hide, a measure of land for taxation purposes, taken to be that area of land necessary to support a peasant family. In later times, it was taken to be equivalent to 120 acres (49 ha).


== History ==


=== Early history ===
Newton Hall was present in the thirteenth century. Hyde was a township in the parish of Stockport. In the late 18th century, the area that was to become the town centre was no more than a cluster of houses known as Red Pump Street. Gee Cross to the south was the larger settlement at that time, with Hyde being primarily the estates of Hyde Hall on the banks of the River Tame. At the 1801 census, the Hyde township had a population of 1,063. The modern town is largely a creation of the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution.


=== Industrial Revolution ===
The Peak Forest Canal was constructed through Hyde, being completed in 1800. It runs from Ashton-under-Lyne to Woodley, Romiley and Marple. Captain Clarke's Bridge, originally named Wood End Canal Bridge, is situated at the end of Woodend Lane. The bridge was erected before Captain Clarke rose to prominence and therefore probably became known as Captain Clarke's Bridge after he retired and resided there.

The population of Hyde increased due to the success of the cotton mills during the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries; at one stage, there were 40 working mills. By 1872, only 27 remained; half of the remaining mills closed between 1921 and 1939 and there is only one working mill in the town today. There were many mill-owning families, including Sidebotham, Hibbert and Horsfield. The main employers in the mills were the Ashton family, who successfully ran a combined spinning and weaving company; most mills concentrated on one process only. The Ashton family built Hyde Chapel, on Stockport Road in Gee Cross. The Ashton Brothers' Mill has been demolished recently to make way for a housing estate.
St George's Church was built in 1832 as a chapel of ease to St Mary's, Stockport. It was built at the instigation of John Hyde Clarke of Hyde Hall and was the first Church of England place of worship in the town; St George's became a parish church in 1842, with its ecclesiastical parish initially covering the whole township of Hyde. Later additions include the lychgate, boathouse by the canal, hearse house, parish rooms and numerous vicarages. The church has a 110-foot (34 m) tower housing eight bells and a clock.
Newton for Hyde railway station opened in 1841 on the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway. It was in the neighbouring township of Newton, 0.6 miles (1 km) north-east of the Market Place in Hyde. Hyde Central railway station, closer to the town centre, was opened in 1858 on a branch line.
In 1853, construction work on the Catholic St Paul's Church in Hyde began. On 21 June 1854, the church was opened. It was designed by the noted architects Matthew Ellison Hadfield, John Grey Weightman and George Goldie in the Gothic Revival style. In 2013, it was designated a Grade II listed building.
Hyde Colliery was a coal mine in the town; in January 1889, an explosion there killed 23 miners. There was an inquiry held the following month at Hyde Town Hall. The following month, Ardwick AFC (now Manchester City) played Newton Heath (now Manchester United) under floodlights at Belle Vue to raise money for the victims' families. The game was watched by 10,000 people and this was the first floodlit match played by either side.


=== 20th century ===
During the 1960s, Myra Hindley and Ian Brady were arrested in their home on the Hattersley estate in Hyde after police found the body of 17-year-old Edward Evans in the house. At their trial, they were found guilty of murdering Evans as well as two other children whose bodies were found buried on Saddleworth Moor several miles away.
Britain's most prolific serial killer, Dr Harold Shipman, had his doctor's surgery in the town where he murdered most of his several hundred victims. The first known victim was 86-year-old Sarah Hannah Marsland of Ashton House in Victoria Street on 7 August 1978 and the last was Kathleen Grundy of Joel Lane on 24 June 1998.


=== 21st century ===

On 18 September 2012, drug dealer Dale Cregan made a hoax emergency call to the police from an address in Mottram in Longdendale, luring police constables Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, of Greater Manchester Police there by claiming that there had been an incident of criminal damage. When they arrived, he murdered them.


== Governance ==
There is one main tier of local government covering Hyde, at metropolitan borough level: Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. There are three Tameside wards named after Hyde: Hyde Godley, Hyde Newton, and Hyde Werneth.
The three Hyde wards all lie within the Stalybridge and Hyde constituency for national elections. The town was previously included in the Hyde constituency, which was created in 1885 and abolished in 1918 when the Stalybridge and Hyde constituency was created.


=== Administrative history ===
Hyde was historically a township in the ancient parish of Stockport, which formed part of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Stockport, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of 'parish' was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Hyde became a civil parish.
The Hyde township was also made a local government district in 1863, administered by an elected local board. The local government district was enlarged in 1877 to take in the neighbouring townships or civil parishes of Newton (also known as Newton Moor), Godley, and the part of Werneth north of the hill of Werneth Low, which area included the village of Gee Cross. The Hyde local government district was incorporated to become a municipal borough in 1881.

The borough council built Hyde Town Hall on Market Street, overlooking Market Place, to serve as its headquarters. The building was completed in 1885. The large bell in the clocktower is known as Owd Joss (Old Josh), on account of the clock and bells having been paid for by Joshua Bradley, who had been a child worker in the mills but later rose to be a factory manager and served as a councillor.
In 1894, the part of Werneth township within the borough was added to the parish of Hyde. The borough then comprised the three urban parishes of Hyde, Godley and Newton until 1923, when they were merged into a single parish of Hyde covering the whole borough. The borough was enlarged in 1936 to take in Hattersley and part of Matley from Tintwistle Rural District.
The borough of Hyde was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester.

Hyde is separated from Denton by the River Tame, a tributary of the River Mersey. There are several areas and suburbs in Hyde, these include: Gee Cross, Newton, Hattersley, Godley, and Flowery Field.

It was rebuilt in 2007 as a much larger central terminus style building, enclosed from the outside; it opened on 23 August 2007 and cost £3.7m to build. The initiative was intended to encourage people to use public transport.
