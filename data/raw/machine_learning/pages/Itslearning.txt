== History ==
The itslearning LMS was created by a group of students at Bergen University College in 1998 as a project on the topic of "virtual classrooms". A council of educators inquired about the platform's feasibility, and once awarded a grant by the College, itslearning was established the following year. Bergen University College became the system's first user. The company was first established as "it:solutions".
In 2004, Arne Bergby became CEO of itslearning. An American office was opened in 2009 in Massachusetts. itslearning acquired SkoleIntra in 2013 and Fronter in 2015. In 2014, 40% of the company was sold to the Swedish private equity fund EQT. The company at the time was valued at 600 million NOK ($73 million).
In December 2019, itslearning was acquired by Sanoma Group – a European learning and media company in Helsinki.
