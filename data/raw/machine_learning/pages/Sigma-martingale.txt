In probability theory, a sigma-martingale is a semimartingale with an integral representation.  Sigma-martingales were introduced by C.S. Chou and M. Emery in 1977 and 1978.   In financial mathematics, sigma-martingales appear in the fundamental theorem of asset pricing as an equivalent condition to no free lunch with vanishing risk (a no-arbitrage condition).
