Later, the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) extended the research into various specialisations including Microwave engineering, Biomedical Signal and Image Processing, VLSI and Embedded systems, Reliability engineering, etc.
In September 2022, the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) decided to establish a Centre of Excellence (CoE) at MEC for advanced learning and research in the following fields of Computer engineering with industrial linkages:

Artificial intelligence (AI)
Machine learning (ML)
Robotics
Automation
The university research centre will come up at a space of around 60,000 sq.ft in the institute.


== Traditions and student activities ==
The foremost student body of the institute is the Senate, which consists of elected representatives from each stream. The institute has several students bodies, of both technical and non-technical nature.
