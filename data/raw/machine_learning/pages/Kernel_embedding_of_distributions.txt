In machine learning, the kernel embedding of distributions (also called the kernel mean or mean map) comprises a class of nonparametric methods in which a probability distribution is represented as an element of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space  (RKHS).   A generalization of the individual data-point feature mapping done in classical kernel methods, the embedding of distributions into infinite-dimensional feature spaces can preserve all of the statistical features of arbitrary distributions, while allowing one to compare and manipulate distributions using Hilbert space operations such as inner products, distances, projections, linear transformations, and spectral analysis.    This learning framework is very general and can be applied to distributions over any space 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
  
 on which a sensible kernel function (measuring similarity between elements of 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
  
) may be defined.  For example, various kernels have been proposed for learning from data which are: vectors in 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}
  
, discrete classes/categories, strings, graphs/networks, images, time series, manifolds, dynamical systems, and other structured objects.  The theory behind kernel embeddings of distributions has been primarily developed by  Alex Smola, Le Song  Archived 2021-04-12 at the Wayback Machine, Arthur Gretton, and Bernhard Schölkopf. A review of recent works on kernel embedding of distributions can be found in.
The analysis of distributions is fundamental in machine learning and statistics,  and many algorithms in these fields rely on information theoretic approaches such as entropy, mutual information, or Kullback–Leibler divergence.  However, to estimate these quantities, one must first either perform density estimation, or employ sophisticated space-partitioning/bias-correction strategies which are typically infeasible for high-dimensional data.  Commonly, methods for modeling complex distributions rely on parametric assumptions that may be unfounded or computationally challenging (e.g. Gaussian mixture models), while nonparametric methods like kernel density estimation (Note: the smoothing kernels in this context have a different interpretation than the kernels discussed here) or characteristic function representation (via the Fourier transform of the distribution) break down in high-dimensional settings.
Methods based on the kernel embedding of distributions sidestep these problems and also possess the following advantages: 

Data may be modeled without restrictive assumptions about the form of the distributions and relationships between variables
Intermediate density estimation is not needed
Practitioners may specify the properties of a distribution most relevant for their problem (incorporating prior knowledge via choice of the kernel)
If a characteristic kernel is used, then the embedding can uniquely preserve all information about a distribution, while thanks to the kernel trick, computations on the potentially infinite-dimensional RKHS can be implemented in practice as simple Gram matrix operations
Dimensionality-independent rates of convergence for the empirical kernel mean (estimated using samples from the distribution)  to the kernel embedding of the true underlying distribution can be proven.
Learning algorithms based on this framework exhibit good generalization ability and finite sample convergence, while often being simpler and more effective than information theoretic methods
Thus, learning via the kernel embedding of distributions offers a principled drop-in replacement for information theoretic approaches and is a framework which not only subsumes many popular methods in machine learning and statistics as special cases, but also can lead to entirely new learning algorithms.

 While the similarity measure is linear in the feature space, it may be highly nonlinear in the original space depending on the choice of kernel.

 (also called the kernel mean or mean map) is given by:

 allows a square integrable density 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  
, then 
  
    
      
        
          μ

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}_{k}}
  
 is the Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator. A kernel is characteristic if the mean embedding 
  
    
      
        μ
        :
        {
        
          family of distributions over

=== Conditional distribution embedding ===
Given a conditional distribution 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        y
        ∣
        x
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(y\mid x),}
  
 one can define the corresponding RKHS embedding as 

  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            Y
            ∣
            x
          
        
        =
        
          E
        
        [
        φ
        (
        Y
        )
        ∣
        X
        ]
        =
        
          ∫
          
            Ω
          
        
        φ
        (
        y
        )
         
        
          d
        
        P
        (
        y
        ∣
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{Y\mid x}=\mathbb {E} [\varphi (Y)\mid X]=\int _{\Omega }\varphi (y)\ \mathrm {d} P(y\mid x)}
  

Note that the embedding of 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        y
        ∣
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(y\mid x)}
  
 thus defines a family of points in the RKHS indexed by the values 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
 taken by conditioning variable 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
. By fixing 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 to a particular value, we obtain a single element in 
  
    
      
        
          
            H
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}
  
, and thus it is natural to define the operator

  
    
      
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      
                        C
                      
                    
                    
                      Y
                      ∣
                      X
                    
                  
                  :
                  
                    
                      H
                    
                  
                  →
                  
                    
                      H

                      Y
                      ∣
                      X
                    
                  
                  =
                  
                    
                      
                        C

    {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}{\mathcal {C}}_{Y\mid X}:{\mathcal {H}}\to {\mathcal {H}}\\{\mathcal {C}}_{Y\mid X}={\mathcal {C}}_{YX}{\mathcal {C}}_{XX}^{-1}\end{cases}}}
  

which given the feature mapping of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
 outputs the conditional embedding of 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  
 given 
  
    
      
        X
        =
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X=x.}
  
 Assuming that for all 
  
    
      
        g
        ∈
        
          
            H
          
        
        :
        
          E
        
        [
        g
        (
        Y
        )
        ∣
        X
        ]
        ∈
        
          
            H
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\in {\mathcal {H}}:\mathbb {E} [g(Y)\mid X]\in {\mathcal {H}},}
  
 it can be shown that 

  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            Y
            ∣
            x
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              C
            
          
          
            Y
            ∣
            X
          
        
        φ
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{Y\mid x}={\mathcal {C}}_{Y\mid X}\varphi (x)}
  

This assumption is always true for finite domains with characteristic kernels, but may not necessarily hold for continuous domains. Nevertheless, even in cases where the assumption fails, 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              C
            
          
          
            Y
            ∣
            X
          
        
        φ
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}_{Y\mid X}\varphi (x)}
  
 may still be used to approximate the conditional kernel embedding 
  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            Y
            ∣
            x
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{Y\mid x},}
  
 and in practice, the inversion operator is replaced with a regularized version of itself 
  
    
      
        (

 (where

The expectation of any function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 in the RKHS can be computed as an inner product with the kernel embedding:

  
    
      
        
          E
        
        [

Statistics based on kernel embeddings thus avoid the curse of dimensionality, and though the true underlying distribution is unknown in practice, one can (with high probability) obtain an approximation within 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          n

For the embedding of conditional distributions, the empirical estimate can be seen as a weighted average of feature mappings (where the weights 
  
    
      
        
          β
          
            i

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta _{i}(x)}

Let

For 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  
 to be universal it suffices that the continuous part of 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  
 in its unique Lebesgue decomposition

    {\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{c}+\mu _{s}}
  
 is non-zero. Furthermore, if

  
    
      
        d
        
          μ

        ω
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\mu _{c}(\omega )=s(\omega )d\omega ,}
  

then 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  
 is the spectral density of frequencies 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  
 in

 and 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
  
 is the Fourier transform of 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  
. If the support of 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  
 is all of

, then 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  
 is a characteristic kernel as well.
If 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  
 induces a strictly positive definite kernel matrix for any set of distinct points, then it is a universal kernel. For example, the widely used Gaussian RBF kernel

== Rules of probability as operations in the RKHS ==
This section illustrates how basic probabilistic rules may be reformulated as (multi)linear algebraic operations in the kernel embedding framework and is primarily based on the work of Song et al. The following notation is adopted:

  
    
      
        P
        (
        X

    {\displaystyle P(X,Y)=}
  
 joint distribution over random variables

              (
              x
              ∣
              Y

=== Measuring distance between distributions ===
The maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is a distance-measure between distributions 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(X)}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        Q
        (
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q(Y)}
  
 which is defined as the distance between their embeddings in the RKHS 

  
    
      
        
          MMD
        
        (
        P
        ,
        Q
        )
        =
        
          
            ‖
            
              
                μ
                
                  X
                
              
              −
              
                μ
                
                  Y
                
              
            
            ‖
          
          
            
              H
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{MMD}}(P,Q)=\left\|\mu _{X}-\mu _{Y}\right\|_{\mathcal {H}}.}
  

While most distance-measures between distributions such as the widely used Kullback–Leibler divergence either require density estimation (either parametrically or nonparametrically) or space partitioning/bias correction strategies, the MMD is easily estimated as an empirical mean which is concentrated around the true value of the MMD. The characterization of this distance as the maximum mean discrepancy refers to the fact that computing the MMD is equivalent to finding the RKHS function that maximizes the difference in expectations between the two probability distributions

        =

=== Density estimation via kernel embeddings ===
Although learning algorithms in the kernel embedding framework circumvent the need for intermediate density estimation, one may nonetheless use the empirical embedding to perform density estimation based on n samples drawn from an underlying distribution 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            X
          
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{X}^{*}}
  
. This can be done by solving the following optimization problem 

  
    
      
        
          max
          
            
              P
              
                X
              
            
          
        
        H

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \max _{P_{X}}H(P_{X})}

                ^

        −

        ]
        
          ‖
          
            
              H
            
          
        
        ≤
        ε
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|{\widehat {\mu }}_{X}-\mu _{X}[P_{X}]\|_{\mathcal {H}}\leq \varepsilon }
  

where the maximization is done over the entire space of distributions on 
  
    
      
        Ω
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega .}

    {\displaystyle \mu _{X}[P_{X}]}
  
 is the kernel embedding of the proposed density 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            X
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{X}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  
 is an entropy-like quantity (e.g. Entropy, KL divergence, Bregman divergence). The distribution which solves this optimization may be interpreted as a compromise between fitting the empirical kernel means of the samples well, while still allocating a substantial portion of the probability mass to all regions of the probability space (much of which may not be represented in the training examples). In practice, a good approximate solution of the difficult optimization may be found by restricting the space of candidate densities to a mixture of M candidate distributions with regularized mixing proportions. Connections between the ideas underlying Gaussian processes and conditional random fields may be drawn with the estimation of conditional probability distributions in this fashion, if one views the feature mappings associated with the kernel as sufficient statistics in generalized (possibly infinite-dimensional) exponential families.

        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  
 (from any domains on which sensible kernels can be defined) can be formulated based on the Hilbert–Schmidt Independence Criterion 

  
    
      
        
          HSIC
        
        (
        X

                  X
                  Y
                
              
              −
              
                μ
                
                  X

and can be used as a principled replacement for mutual information, Pearson correlation or any other dependence measure used in learning algorithms. Most notably, HSIC can detect arbitrary dependencies (when a characteristic kernel is used in the embeddings, HSIC is zero if and only if the variables are independent), and can be used to measure dependence between different types of data (e.g. images and text captions). Given n i.i.d. samples of each random variable, a simple parameter-free unbiased estimator of HSIC which exhibits concentration about the true value can be computed in

HSIC can be extended to measure the dependence of multiple random variables. The question of when HSIC captures independence in this case has recently been studied: for

=== Kernel belief propagation ===
Belief propagation is a fundamental algorithm for inference in graphical models in which nodes repeatedly pass and receive messages corresponding to the evaluation of conditional expectations. In the kernel embedding framework, the messages may be represented as RKHS functions and the conditional distribution embeddings can be applied to efficiently compute message updates. Given n samples of random variables represented by nodes in a Markov random field, the incoming message to node t from node u can be expressed as

  
    
      
        
          m
          
            u
            t
          
        
        (
        ⋅
        )
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            1

            t
          
          
            i
          
        
        φ
        (
        
          x

    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Upsilon }}_{s}=\left(\varphi (x_{s}^{1}),\dots ,\varphi (x_{s}^{n})\right)}

            t

          X
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{s}}
  
. This RKHS function representation of message-passing updates therefore produces an efficient belief propagation algorithm in which the potentials are nonparametric functions inferred from the data so that arbitrary statistical relationships may be modeled.


=== Nonparametric filtering in hidden Markov models ===
In the hidden Markov model (HMM), two key quantities of interest are the transition probabilities between hidden states 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        
          S
          
            t
          
        
        ∣
        
          S
          
            t
            −
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(S^{t}\mid S^{t-1})}
  
 and the emission probabilities 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        
          O
          
            t
          
        
        ∣
        
          S
          
            t
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(O^{t}\mid S^{t})}
  
 for observations. Using the kernel conditional distribution embedding framework, these quantities may be expressed in terms of samples from the HMM. A serious limitation of the embedding methods in this domain is the need for training samples containing hidden states, as otherwise inference with arbitrary distributions in the HMM is not possible.
One common use of HMMs is filtering in which the goal is to estimate posterior distribution over the hidden state

=== Support measure machines ===
The support measure machine (SMM) is a generalization of the support vector machine (SVM) in which the training examples are probability distributions paired with labels 
  
    
      
        {
        
          P

          x

    {\displaystyle \{x_{i},y_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}}
  
, and thus the SMM can be viewed as a flexible SVM in which a different data-dependent kernel (specified by the assumed form of the distribution 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{i}}
  
) may be placed on each training point.


=== Domain adaptation under covariate, target, and conditional shift ===
The goal of domain adaptation is the formulation of learning algorithms which generalize well when the training and test data have different distributions. Given training examples

            i
          
          
            tr
          
        
        )

    {\displaystyle \{(x_{i}^{\text{tr}},y_{i}^{\text{tr}})\}_{i=1}^{n}}
  
 and a test set 
  
    
      
        {
        (
        
          x

            te
          
        
        ,
        
          y
          
            j

 where the 
  
    
      
        
          y
          
            j

    {\displaystyle y_{j}^{\text{te}}}
  
 are unknown, three types of differences are commonly assumed between the distribution of the training examples 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            tr
          
        
        (
        X
        ,
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P^{\text{tr}}(X,Y)}
  
 and the test distribution 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            te
          
        
        (
        X
        ,
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P^{\text{te}}(X,Y)}
  
:

Covariate shift in which the marginal distribution of the covariates changes across domains: 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            tr
          
        
        (
        X
        )
        ≠
        
          P
          
            te
          
        
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P^{\text{tr}}(X)\neq P^{\text{te}}(X)}
  

Target shift in which the marginal distribution of the outputs changes across domains: 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            tr
          
        
        (
        Y
        )
        ≠
        
          P
          
            te
          
        
        (
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P^{\text{tr}}(Y)\neq P^{\text{te}}(Y)}
  

Conditional shift in which 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(Y)}
  
 remains the same across domains, but the conditional distributions differ: 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            tr
          
        
        (
        X
        ∣
        Y
        )
        ≠
        
          P
          
            te
          
        
        (
        X
        ∣
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P^{\text{tr}}(X\mid Y)\neq P^{\text{te}}(X\mid Y)}
  
. In general, the presence of conditional shift leads to an ill-posed problem, and the additional assumption that 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        X
        ∣
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(X\mid Y)}
  
 changes only under location-scale (LS) transformations on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 is commonly imposed to make the problem tractable.
By utilizing the kernel embedding of marginal and conditional distributions, practical approaches to deal with the presence of these types of differences between training and test domains can be formulated. Covariate shift may be accounted for by reweighting examples via estimates of the ratio 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            te
          
        
        (
        X
        )
        
          /
        
        
          P
          
            tr
          
        
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P^{\text{te}}(X)/P^{\text{tr}}(X)}
  
 obtained directly from the kernel embeddings of the marginal distributions of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 in each domain without any need for explicit estimation of the distributions. Target shift, which cannot be similarly dealt with since no samples from 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  
 are available in the test domain, is accounted for by weighting training examples using the vector 
  
    
      
        
          
            β
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        
          
            y

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\beta }}^{*}(\mathbf {y} ^{\text{tr}})}
  
 which solves the following optimization problem (where in practice, empirical approximations must be used) 

  
    
      
        
          min

To deal with location scale conditional shift, one can perform a LS transformation of the training points to obtain new transformed training data 
  
    
      
        
          
            X
          
          
            new
          
        
        =
        
          
            X
          
          
            tr
          
        
        ⊙
        
          W
        
        +
        
          B
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {X} ^{\text{new}}=\mathbf {X} ^{\text{tr}}\odot \mathbf {W} +\mathbf {B} }
  
 (where 
  
    
      
        ⊙
      
    
    {\displaystyle \odot }
  
 denotes the element-wise vector product). To ensure similar distributions between the new transformed training samples and the test data, 
  
    
      
        
          W
        
        ,

In general, the kernel embedding methods for dealing with LS conditional shift and target shift may be combined to find a reweighted transformation of the training data which mimics the test distribution, and these methods may perform well even in the presence of conditional shifts other than location-scale changes.


=== Domain generalization via invariant feature representation ===

, the goal of domain generalization is to formulate learning algorithms which perform well on test examples sampled from a previously unseen domain 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        X
        ,
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P^{*}(X,Y)}
  
 where no data from the test domain is available at training time. If conditional distributions 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        Y
        ∣
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(Y\mid X)}
  
 are assumed to be relatively similar across all domains, then a learner capable of domain generalization must estimate a functional relationship between the variables which is robust to changes in the marginals 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(X)}
  
. Based on kernel embeddings of these distributions, Domain Invariant Component Analysis (DICA) is a method which determines the transformation of the training data that minimizes the difference between marginal distributions while preserving a common conditional distribution shared between all training domains. DICA thus extracts invariants, features that transfer across domains, and may be viewed as a generalization of many popular dimension-reduction methods such as kernel principal component analysis, transfer component analysis, and covariance operator inverse regression.

 (in the feature space) across all domains (rather than preserving a central subspace).


=== Distribution regression ===
In distribution regression, the goal is to regress from probability distributions to reals (or vectors). Many important machine learning and statistical tasks fit into this framework, including multi-instance learning, and point estimation problems without analytical solution (such as hyperparameter or entropy estimation). In practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and the estimates have to rely on similarities computed between sets of points. Distribution regression has been successfully applied for example in supervised entropy learning, and aerosol prediction using multispectral satellite images.

== Example ==
In this simple example, which is taken from Song et al., 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,Y}
  
 are assumed to be discrete random variables which take values in the set 
  
    
      
        {
        1
        ,
        …
        ,
        K
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{1,\ldots ,K\}}
  
 and the kernel is chosen to be the Kronecker delta function, so 
  
    
      
        k
        (
        x
        ,
        
          x
          ′
        
        )
        =
        δ
        (
        x
        ,
        
          x
          ′
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k(x,x')=\delta (x,x')}
  
. The feature map corresponding to this kernel is the standard basis vector 
  
    
      
        φ
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            e

    {\displaystyle \varphi (x)=\mathbf {e} _{x}}
  
. The kernel embeddings of such a distributions are thus vectors of marginal probabilities while the embeddings of joint distributions in this setting are
