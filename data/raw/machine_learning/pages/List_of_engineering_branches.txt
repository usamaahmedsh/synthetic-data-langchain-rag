Engineering is the discipline and profession that applies scientific theories, mathematical methods, and empirical evidence to design, create, and analyze technological solutions, balancing technical requirements with concerns or constraints on safety, human factors, physical limits, regulations, practicality, and cost, and often at an industrial scale. In the contemporary era, engineering is generally considered to consist of the major primary branches of biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, materials engineering and mechanical engineering. There are numerous other engineering sub-disciplines and interdisciplinary subjects that may or may not be grouped with these major engineering branches.


== Biomedical engineering ==
Biomedical engineering is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare applications (e.g., diagnostic or therapeutic purposes).


== Chemical engineering ==
Chemical engineering is the application of chemical, physical, and biological sciences to developing technological solutions from raw materials or chemicals.


== Civil engineering ==
Civil engineering comprises the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and natural built environments.


== Electrical engineering ==
Electrical engineering comprises the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism.


== Material engineering ==
Materials engineering is the application of material science and engineering principles to understand the properties of materials. Material science emerged in the mid-20th century, grouping together fields which had previously been considered unrelated. Materials engineering is thus much more interdisciplinary than the other major engineering branches.


== Mechanical engineering ==
Mechanical engineering comprises the design and analysis of heat and mechanical power for the operation of machines and mechanical systems.


== Interdisciplinary ==
