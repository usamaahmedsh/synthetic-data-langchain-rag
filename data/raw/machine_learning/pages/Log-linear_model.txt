A log-linear model is a mathematical model that takes the form of a function whose logarithm equals a linear combination of the parameters of the model, which makes it possible to apply (possibly multivariate) linear regression. That is, it has the general form

  
    
      
        exp
        ⁡
        
          (
          
            c
            +
            
              ∑
              
                i
              
            
            
              w
              
                i
              
            
            
              f
              
                i
              
            
            (
            X
            )
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \exp \left(c+\sum _{i}w_{i}f_{i}(X)\right)}

in which the fi(X) are quantities that are functions of the variable X, in general a vector of values, while c and the wi stand for the model parameters.
The term may specifically be used for:

A log-linear plot or graph, which is a type of semi-log plot.
Poisson regression for contingency tables, a type of generalized linear model.
The specific applications of log-linear models are where the output quantity lies in the range 0 to ∞, for values of the independent variables X,  or more immediately, the transformed quantities fi(X)  in the range −∞ to +∞. This may be contrasted to logistic models, similar to the logistic function, for which the output quantity lies in the range 0 to 1. Thus the contexts where these models are useful or realistic often depends on the range of the values being modelled.
