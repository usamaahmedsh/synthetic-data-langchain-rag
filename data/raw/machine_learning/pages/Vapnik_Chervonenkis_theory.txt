Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory (also known as VC theory) was developed during 1960–1990 by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis. The theory is a form of computational learning theory, which attempts to explain the learning process from a statistical point of view.


== Introduction ==
VC theory covers at least four parts (as explained in The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory):

Theory of consistency of learning processes
What are (necessary and sufficient) conditions for consistency of a learning process based on the empirical risk minimization principle?
Nonasymptotic theory of the rate of convergence of learning processes
How fast is the rate of convergence of the learning process?
Theory of controlling the generalization ability of learning processes
How can one control the rate of convergence (the generalization ability) of the learning process?
Theory of constructing learning machines
How can one construct algorithms that can control the generalization ability?
VC Theory is a major subbranch of statistical learning theory. One of its main applications in statistical learning theory is to provide generalization conditions for learning algorithms.  From this point of view, VC theory is related to stability, which is an alternative approach for characterizing generalization.
In addition, VC theory and VC dimension are instrumental in the theory of empirical processes, in the case of processes indexed by VC classes. Arguably these are the most important applications of the VC theory, and are employed in proving generalization. Several techniques will be introduced that are widely used in the empirical process and VC theory. The discussion is mainly based on the book Weak Convergence and Empirical Processes: With Applications to Statistics.

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|Q\|_{\mathcal {F}}=\sup\{\vert Qf\vert \ :\ f\in {\mathcal {F}}\}.}
  

Let 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            1

            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{1},\ldots ,X_{n}}
  
 be independent, identically distributed random elements of 
  
    
      
        (
        
          
            X
          
        
        ,

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {X}},{\mathcal {A}})}
  
. Then define the empirical measure

  
    
      
        
          
            P

          ∑
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          δ

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} _{n}=n^{-1}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\delta _{X_{i}},}
  

where δ here stands for the Dirac measure. The empirical measure induces a map 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\to \mathbf {R} }
  
 given by:

  
    
      
        f
        ↦
        
          
            P
          
          
            n
          
        
        f
        =
        
          
            1
            n
          
        
        (
        f
        (
        
          X
          
            1
          
        
        )
        +
        .
        .
        .
        +
        f
        (

        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\mapsto \mathbb {P} _{n}f={\frac {1}{n}}(f(X_{1})+...+f(X_{n}))}
  

Now suppose P is the underlying true distribution of the data, which is unknown. Empirical Processes theory aims at identifying classes 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 for which statements such as the following hold:

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 cannot be too large, and as it turns out that the geometry of

One way of measuring how big the function set

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 is to use the so-called covering numbers. The covering number

    {\displaystyle N(\varepsilon ,{\mathcal {F}},\|\cdot \|)}

        ε
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{g:\|g-f\|<\varepsilon \}}
  
 needed to cover the set 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 (here it is obviously assumed that there is an underlying norm on

Two sufficient conditions are provided below, under which it can be proved that the set

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 is P-Glivenko–Cantelli if it is P-measurable with envelope F such that 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            ∗

=== Symmetrization ===
The majority of the arguments about how to bound the empirical process rely on symmetrization, maximal and concentration inequalities, and chaining. Symmetrization is usually the first step of the proofs, and since it is used in many machine learning proofs on bounding empirical loss functions (including the proof of the VC inequality which is discussed in the next section). It is presented here:
Consider the empirical process:

  
    
      
        f
        ↦
        (
        
          
            P
          
          
            n
          
        
        −
        P
        )
        f
        =
        
          
            
              1
              n
            
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        (
        f
        (
        
          X
          
            i
          
        
        )
        −
        P
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\mapsto (\mathbb {P} _{n}-P)f={\dfrac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}(f(X_{i})-Pf)}
  

Turns out that there is a connection between the empirical and the following symmetrized process:

  
    
      
        f
        ↦
        
          
            P
          
          
            n
          
          
            0
          
        
        f
        =
        
          
            
              1
              n
            
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          ε
          
            i
          
        
        f
        (
        
          X
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\mapsto \mathbb {P} _{n}^{0}f={\dfrac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\varepsilon _{i}f(X_{i})}
  

The symmetrized process is a Rademacher process, conditionally on the data 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{i}}
  
. Therefore, it is a sub-Gaussian process by Hoeffding's inequality.

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} \Phi (\|\mathbb {P} _{n}-P\|_{\mathcal {F}})\leq \mathbb {E} \Phi \left(2\left\|\mathbb {P} _{n}^{0}\right\|_{\mathcal {F}}\right)}
  

The proof of the Symmetrization lemma relies on introducing independent copies of the original variables 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{i}}
  
 (sometimes referred to as a ghost sample) and replacing the inner expectation of the LHS by these copies. After an application of Jensen's inequality different signs could be introduced (hence the name symmetrization) without changing the expectation. The proof can be found below because of its instructive nature. The same proof method can be used to prove the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem.

A typical way of proving empirical CLTs, first uses symmetrization to pass the empirical process to 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
          
            n
          
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} _{n}^{0}}
  
 and then argue conditionally on the data, using the fact that Rademacher processes are simple processes with nice properties.


=== VC Connection ===

 and the entropy numbers. Uniform  covering numbers can be controlled by the notion of Vapnik–Chervonenkis classes of sets – or shortly VC sets.

Which is a polynomial number

 of subsets rather than an exponential number. Intuitively this means that a finite VC-index implies that

 has an apparent simplistic structure.
A similar bound can be shown (with a different constant, same rate) for the so-called VC subgraph classes. For a function

          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:{\mathcal {X}}\to \mathbf {R} }
  
 the subgraph is a subset of 
  
    
      
        
          
            X

          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {X}}\times \mathbf {R} }
  
 such that: 
  
    
      
        {
        (
        x
        ,
        t
        )
        :
        t
        <
        f
        (
        x
        )
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{(x,t):t<f(x)\}}
  
. A collection of 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 is called a VC subgraph class if all subgraphs form a VC-class.

Further consider the symmetric convex hull of a set

the following is valid for the convex hull of 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
:

  
    
      
        log

            ,
            sconv
            ⁡
            
              
                F
              
            
            ,
            
              L
              
                2
              
            
            (
            Q

          )
        
        ≤
        K
        
          ε

    {\displaystyle \log N\left(\varepsilon \|F\|_{Q,2},\operatorname {sconv} {\mathcal {F}},L_{2}(Q)\right)\leq K\varepsilon ^{-{\frac {2V}{V+2}}}}
  

The important consequence of this fact is that

  
    
      
        
          
            
              2
              V
            
            
              V
              +
              2
            
          
        
        <
        2
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {2V}{V+2}}<2,}
  

which is just enough so that the entropy integral is going to converge, and therefore the class 
  
    
      
        sconv
        ⁡
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {sconv} {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 is going to be P-Donsker.
Finally an example of a VC-subgraph class is considered. Any finite-dimensional vector space

        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:{\mathcal {X}}\to \mathbf {R} }
  
 is VC-subgraph of index smaller than or equal to 
  
    
      
        dim

        ,
        
        ∀
        f
        ∈
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{a_{i}>0}a_{i}(f(x_{i})-t_{i})=\sum _{a_{i}<0}(-a_{i})(f(x_{i})-t_{i}),\quad \forall f\in {\mathcal {F}}}
  

Consider the set 
  
    
      
        S
        =
        {
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        
          t
          
            i
          
        
        )
        :
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        >
        0
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle S=\{(x_{i},t_{i}):a_{i}>0\}}
  
. This set cannot be picked out since if there is some 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 such that 
  
    
      
        S
        =
        {
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        
          t
          
            i
          
        
        )
        :
        f
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        )
        >
        
          t
          
            i
          
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle S=\{(x_{i},t_{i}):f(x_{i})>t_{i}\}}
  
 that would imply that the LHS is strictly positive but the RHS is non-positive.
There are generalizations of the notion VC subgraph class, e.g. there is the notion of pseudo-dimension.

A similar setting is considered, which is more common to machine learning. Let 
  
    
      
        
          
            X
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {X}}}
  
 is a feature space and 
  
    
      
        
          
            Y
          
        
        =
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {Y}}=\{0,1\}}
  
. A function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        
          
            X
          
        
        →
        
          
            Y
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:{\mathcal {X}}\to {\mathcal {Y}}}
  
 is called a classifier. Let 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 be a set of classifiers. Similarly to the previous section, define the shattering coefficient (also known as growth function):

  
    
      
        S
        (
        
          
            F
          
        
        ,
        n
        )
        =
        
          max
          
            
              x
              
                1
              
            
            ,
            …
            ,
            
              x
              
                n
              
            
          
        
        
          |
        
        {
        (
        f
        (
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        )
        ,
        …
        ,
        f
        (
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        )
        )
        ,
        f
        ∈
        
          
            F
          
        
        }
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S({\mathcal {F}},n)=\max _{x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}|\{(f(x_{1}),\ldots ,f(x_{n})),f\in {\mathcal {F}}\}|}
  

Note here that there is a 1:1 go  between each of the functions in 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 and the set on which the function is 1. We can thus define 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
  
 to be the collection of subsets obtained from the above mapping for every 
  
    
      
        f
        ∈
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\in {\mathcal {F}}}
  
. Therefore, in terms of the previous section the shattering coefficient is precisely

  
    
      
        
          max
          
            
              x
              
                1
              
            
            ,
            …
            ,
            
              x
              
                n
              
            
          
        
        
          Δ
          
            n
          
        
        (
        
          
            C
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \max _{x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}\Delta _{n}({\mathcal {C}},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})}
  
.
This equivalence together with Sauer's Lemma implies that 
  
    
      
        S
        (
        
          
            F
          
        
        ,
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S({\mathcal {F}},n)}
  
 is going to be polynomial in n, for sufficiently large n provided that the collection 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
  
 has a finite VC-index.

    {\displaystyle D_{n}=\{(X_{1},Y_{1}),\ldots ,(X_{n},Y_{m})\}}
  
 is an observed dataset. Assume that the data is generated by an unknown probability distribution 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            X
            Y
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{XY}}
  
. Define 
  
    
      
        R
        (
        f
        )
        =

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle R(f)=P(f(X)\neq Y)}
  
 to be the expected 0/1 loss. Of course since 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            X
            Y
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{XY}}
  
 is unknown in general, one has no access to 
  
    
      
        R
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle R(f)}
  
. However the empirical risk, given by:

can certainly be evaluated. Then one has the following Theorem:


=== Theorem (VC Inequality) ===
For binary classification and the 0/1 loss function we have the following generalization bounds:

In words the VC inequality is saying that as the sample increases, provided that 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 has a finite VC dimension, the empirical 0/1 risk becomes a good proxy for the expected 0/1 risk. Note that both RHS of the two inequalities will converge to 0, provided that 
  
    
      
        S
        (
        
          
            F
          
        
        ,
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S({\mathcal {F}},n)}
  
 grows polynomially in n.
The connection between this framework and the Empirical Process framework is evident. Here one is dealing with a modified empirical process

                      R
                      ^
                    
                  
                
                
                  n
                
              
              −
              R
            
            |
          
          
            
              F
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left|{\hat {R}}_{n}-R\right|_{\mathcal {F}}}
  

but not surprisingly the ideas are the same. The proof of the (first part of) VC inequality, relies on symmetrization, and then argue conditionally on the data using concentration inequalities (in particular Hoeffding's inequality). The interested reader can check the book  Theorems 12.4 and 12.5.
