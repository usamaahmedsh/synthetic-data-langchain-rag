In probability theory, a continuous stochastic process is a type of stochastic process that may be said to be "continuous" as a function of its "time" or index parameter. Continuity is a nice property for (the sample paths of) a process to have, since it implies that they are well-behaved in some sense, and, therefore, much easier to analyze. It is implicit here that the index of the stochastic process is a continuous variable. Some authors define a "continuous (stochastic) process" as only requiring that the index variable be continuous, without continuity of sample paths: in another terminology, this would be a continuous-time stochastic process, in parallel to a "discrete-time process". Given the possible confusion, caution is needed.


== Definitions ==
Let (Ω, Σ, P) be a probability space, let T be some interval of time, and let X : T × Ω → S be a stochastic process. For simplicity, the rest of this article will take the state space S to be the real line R, but the definitions go through mutatis mutandis if S is Rn, a normed vector space, or even a general metric space.


=== Continuity almost surely ===
Given a time t ∈ T, X is said to be continuous with probability one at t if

=== Mean-square continuity ===
Given a time t ∈ T, X is said to be continuous in mean-square at t if E[|Xt|2] < +∞ and

    {\displaystyle \lim _{s\to t}\mathbf {E} \left[{\frac {{\big |}X_{s}-X_{t}{\big |}}{1+{\big |}X_{s}-X_{t}{\big |}}}\right]=0.}
  


=== Continuity in distribution ===
Given a time t ∈ T, X is said to be continuous in distribution at t if

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            s
            →
            t
          
        
        
          F
          
            s
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          F
          
            t
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{s\to t}F_{s}(x)=F_{t}(x)}
  

for all points x at which Ft is continuous, where Ft denotes the cumulative distribution function of the random variable Xt.


=== Sample continuity ===

X is said to be sample continuous if Xt(ω) is continuous in t for P-almost all ω ∈ Ω. Sample continuity is the appropriate notion of continuity for processes such as Itō diffusions.


=== Feller continuity ===

X is said to be a Feller-continuous process if, for any fixed t ∈ T and any bounded, continuous and Σ-measurable function g : S → R, Ex[g(Xt)] depends continuously upon x. Here x denotes the initial state of the process X, and Ex denotes expectation conditional upon the event that X starts at x.


== Relationships ==
The relationships between the various types of continuity of stochastic processes are akin to the relationships between the various types of convergence of random variables. In particular:

continuity with probability one implies continuity in probability;
continuity in mean-square implies continuity in probability;
continuity with probability one neither implies, nor is implied by, continuity in mean-square;
continuity in probability implies, but is not implied by, continuity in distribution.
It is tempting to confuse continuity with probability one with sample continuity. Continuity with probability one at time t means that P(At) = 0, where the event At is given by

  
    
      
        
          A
          
            t
          
        
        =
        
          {
          
            ω
            ∈
            Ω
            
              |
              
                
                  lim
                  
                    s
                    →
                    t
                  
                
                
                  
                    |
                  
                
                
                  X
                  
                    s
                  
                
                (
                ω
                )
                −
                
                  X
                  
                    t
                  
                
                (
                ω
                )
                
                  
                    |
                  
                
                ≠
                0
              
              
            
          
          }
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{t}=\left\{\omega \in \Omega \left|\lim _{s\to t}{\big |}X_{s}(\omega )-X_{t}(\omega ){\big |}\neq 0\right.\right\},}
  

and it is perfectly feasible to check whether or not this holds for each t ∈ T. Sample continuity, on the other hand, requires that P(A) = 0, where

  
    
      
        A
        =
        
          ⋃
          
            t
            ∈
            T
          
        
        
          A
          
            t
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle A=\bigcup _{t\in T}A_{t}.}
  

A is an uncountable union of events, so it may not actually be an event itself, so P(A) may be undefined! Even worse, even if A is an event, P(A) can be strictly positive even if P(At) = 0 for every t ∈ T. This is the case, for example, with the telegraph process.
