In computational learning theory in mathematics, a concept over a domain X is a total Boolean function over X. A concept class is a class of concepts. Concept classes are a subject of computational learning theory.
Concept class terminology frequently appears in model theory associated with probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. In this setting, if one takes a set Y as a set of (classifier output) labels, and X is a set of examples, the map 
  
    
      
        c
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle c:X\to Y}
  
, i.e. from examples to classifier labels (where 
  
    
      
        Y
        =
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y=\{0,1\}}
  
 and where c is a subset of X), c is then said to be a concept. A concept class 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  
 is then a collection of such concepts.
Given a class of concepts C, a subclass D is reachable if there exists a sample s such that D contains exactly those concepts in C that are extensions to s. Not every subclass is reachable.


== Background ==

A sample 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  
 is a partial function from 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 to 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{0,1\}}
  
. Identifying a concept with its characteristic function mapping 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 to 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{0,1\}}
  
, it is a special case of a sample.
Two samples are consistent if they agree on the intersection of their domains. A sample 
  
    
      
        
          s
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s'}
  
 extends another sample 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  
 if the two are consistent and the domain of 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  
 is contained in the domain of 
  
    
      
        
          s
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s'}
  
.


== Examples ==
Suppose that 
  
    
      
        C
        =
        
          S
          
            +
          
        
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle C=S^{+}(X)}
  
. Then:

the subclass 
  
    
      
        {
        {
        x
        }
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\{x\}\}}
  
 is reachable with the sample 
  
    
      
        s
        =
        {
        (
        x
        ,
        1
        )
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle s=\{(x,1)\}}
  
;
the subclass 
  
    
      
        
          S
          
            +
          
        
        (
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S^{+}(Y)}
  
 for 
  
    
      
        Y
        ⊆
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y\subseteq X}
  
 are reachable with a sample that maps the elements of 
  
    
      
        X
        −
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle X-Y}
  
 to zero;
the subclass 
  
    
      
        S
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S(X)}
  
, which consists of the singleton sets, is not reachable.


== Applications ==
Let 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  
 be some concept class. For any concept 
  
    
      
        c
        ∈
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\in C}
  
, we call this concept 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/d}
  
-good for a positive integer 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  
 if, for all 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
  
, at least 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/d}
  
 of the concepts in 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  
 agree with 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  
 on the classification of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
. The fingerprint dimension 
  
    
      
        F
        D
        (
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle FD(C)}
  
 of the entire concept class 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  
 is the least positive integer 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  
 such that every reachable subclass 
  
    
      
        
          C
          ′
        
        ⊆
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C'\subseteq C}
  
 contains a concept that is 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/d}
  
-good for it. This quantity can be used to bound the minimum number of equivalence queries needed to learn a class of concepts according to the following inequality:
  
    
      
        F
        D
        (
        C
        )
        −
        1
        ≤
        #
        E
        Q
        (
        C
        )
        ≤
        ⌈
        F
        D
        (
        C
        )
        ln
        ⁡
        (
        
          |
        
        C
        
          |
        
        )
        ⌉
      
    
    {\textstyle FD(C)-1\leq \#EQ(C)\leq \lceil FD(C)\ln(|C|)\rceil }
  
.
