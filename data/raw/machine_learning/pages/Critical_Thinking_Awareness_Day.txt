Critical Thinking Awareness Day is an annual event to promote rational and critical thinking by the public. February 15, 2024 was proclaimed by the Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, to be the first Critical Thinking Awareness day, due solely to the efforts put forth by the West Virginia Skeptics Society. 
The proclamation states that, "critical thinking is an essential skill empowering people to think rationally and make informed decisions, and it fosters creativity, problem solving and independent thought; critical thinking also encourages people to analyze and evaluate information from different perspectives and sources, helping to prevent misinformation, promoting responsible citizenship and contributing to the development of a more just and democratic society. Critical thinking is a lifelong skill that can be developed and improved through education, training and practice."
The date was selected to align closely with the national Classroom Science Days so that school could organize activities that promote both science and critical thinking.
Free activities and resources were organized for schools, from elementary through university and college level, as well as for the public through libraries. Activities included trivia games, debates, and a screening of a documentary that promoted viewing mainstream media through a critical lens.
A group in Utah is working to have Critical Thinking Awareness Day proclaimed in their area. Other states and countries are encouraged to do the same in order to inspire people to reflect on how critical thinking impacts day to day life.
