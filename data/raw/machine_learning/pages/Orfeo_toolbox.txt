In computer science, Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) is a software library for processing images from Earth observation satellites.
OTB was initiated by the French space agency (CNES) in 2006. The software is released under a free licence; a number of contributors outside CNES are taking part in development and integrating into other projects.
The library was originally targeted at high resolution images acquired by the Orfeo constellation: Pléiades and Cosmo-Skymed, but it also handles other sensors.


== Purpose ==
OTB provides:

Image access: read/write access for most remote sensing image formats (using GDAL), meta-data access, visualization
Data access: vector data access (shapefile, kml), DEM model, lidar data 
Filtering: blurring, denoising, enhancement for optical or radar data 
Feature extraction: texture computations including Haralick, SFS, Pantex, Edge density, points of interest, alignments, lines, SIFT, SURF
Image segmentation: region growing, watershed, level sets 
Classification: K-means, SVM, Markov random fields and access to all OpenCV machine learning algorithms
Change detection
Stereo reconstruction from images
Orthorectification and map projections (using ossim) 
Radiometric indices (vegetation, water, soil) 
Object-based segmentation and filtering
PCA computation
Visualization: a flexible visualization system, customizable via plugins;


== Languages and interaction with other software ==
OTB is a C++ library, based on Insight toolkit (ITK). Bindings are developed for Python. A method to use OTB components within IDL/ENVI has been published. One of the OTB user defined a procedure to use the library capabilities from MATLAB.
Since late 2009, some modules are developed as processing plugins for QGIS. Modules for classification, segmentation, hill shading have provided. This effort relies only on volunteers.
OTB algorithms were available in QGIS through the processing framework Sextante. Since March 2024, a QGIS plugin is now available in QGIS catalog to work with an installed OTB software.


== Applications ==
Additionally to the library, several applications with GUI are distributed. These application enable interactive segmentation, orthorectification, classification, image registration, etc...


== Monteverdi (version 1 and 2) ==
The OTB-Applications package makes available a set of simple software tools . It supports raster and vector data and integrates most of the already existing OTB applications. The architecture takes advantage of the streaming and multi-threading capabilities of the OTB pipeline. It also uses features such as processing on demand and automagic file format I/O. The application is called Monteverdi.
In 2013, Monteverdi software was revamped into a new software called Monteverdi2.
Since OTB version 9.0 Monterverdi is no longer packaged and supported. However a QGIS plugin allow to use otb application with GUI.


== License ==
OTB was initially distributed under the French Open Source license CeCILL (similar and compatible with the GNU GPL) and is now available under the Apache 2.0 license.


== History ==
The development started in January 2006  with the first release in July 2006. The development version is publicly accessible.

According to statistics on Open Hub, there is a total of 95 contributors and almost 402,000 lines of code (this include many libraries upon which OTB is built).
OTB in also use for the development of the operational ground segment for the VENμS (Vegetation and Environment monitoring on a New Micro Satellite) and the ESA Sentinel-2 missions.
