This is a list of models and meshes commonly used in 3D computer graphics for testing and demonstrating rendering algorithms and visual effects. Their use is important for comparing results, similar to the way standard test images are used in image processing.


== Modeled ==
Designed using CAD software; sorted by year of modeling.


== Scanned ==
Includes photogrammetric methods; sorted by year of scanning.
