The Brown Journal of World Affairs is a biannual academic journal of international relations and foreign policy produced at Watson School of International and Public Affairs at Brown University. It was founded in 1993 as the Brown Journal of Foreign Affairs by Daniel Cruise, Alex Scribner, and Michael Soussan. The journal features essays written by world leaders, policymakers, and prominent academics. Each issue is composed of three thematic sections dedicated to exploring different topics in contemporary international politics and economics. In addition, each issue includes an open essay section, in which a wide variety of global issues are discussed. 
The Journal is funded in part by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and Brown's Finance Board.
