Codexis, Inc. is a protein engineering company that develops enzymes for pharmaceutical, food and medical applications.


== History ==
Codexis is based in Redwood City, CA and was incorporated in 2002. It went public in April 2010 on NASDAQ, and in October, acquired Maxygen's MolecularBreeding technology portfolio.


=== Pharmaceutical ===
Codexis won the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2006 for its work on a building block of Lipitor. It then won a second time in 2010 for its work with Merck & Co. on the active ingredient in Januvia.


=== Nutrition ===
In 2017, the company entered a partnership with Tate & Lyle to provide research and development for the production of new ingredients. That same year, Codexis announced a collaboration with Nestle to provide enzymes for metabolic disorders.


=== Biotherapeutics ===
In 2017, Codexis developed a recombinant phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) enzyme, to act as a substitute phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme for people who suffer from phenylketonuria. The enzyme was in-licensed by Nestle Health Sciences.
In 2020, Takeda Pharmaceutical announced a collaboration with Codexis to research and create gene therapies for rare diseases, including lysosomal storage disorders.


=== Life science ===
In June 2020, they announced a partnership with Molecular Assemblies to engineer enzymes for DNA synthesis.


== Technology ==
Codexis uses directed evolution to develop its enzymes. Using this method, scientists genetically engineer genes, then screen the enzymes produced to see if it creates the properties needed for a specific reaction. Their protein engineering platform, called CodeEvolver, uses machine learning and high-throughput experimentation to learn protein sequence changes and their impacts on protein function.
