=== Wheego Whip ===

Wheego Electric Cars' first automobile was the Whip, a two-seat compact car that was launched in the United States in August 2009, in partnership with Shuanghuan Auto. The car is based on the Shuanghuan Noble platform manufactured by Shuanghuan in China, with final assembly with the motor, drive train, controller, electronic components, and programming completed in the United States. It was marketed exclusively by Wheego in North America, Japan, and the Caribbean as a low-speed vehicle (maximum speed of 25 mph (40 km/h)) or medium-speed vehicle (35 mph (56 km/h)) depending on local state regulations.


=== Wheego LiFe ===

Wheego Electric Cars' second automobile was the LiFe, a highway-capable version with a lithium iron phosphate battery pack that began selling in April 2011 and ceased production in 2013. The LiFe, similar to the Whip, was a small-sized car sourced from China fitted with an electric drivetrain and batteries installed in California. It was driven by a 60 horsepower electric synchronous induction motor attached to a 60 kilowatt-hour lithium battery pack. Priced at $32,995, it was marketed as a commuter car. It became the third all-electric highway speed street legal car for sale in the United States after the Tesla Roadster and the Nissan Leaf. It was electronically limited to 65 mph (105 km/h) and had an advertised range of approximately 100 miles on a single charge. The LiFe could be recharged using either a standard 120V connection or an industry-standard Level 2 Charging Station.
