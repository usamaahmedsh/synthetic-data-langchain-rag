Sambalpur University Institute of Information Technology (SUIIT) was established in 2010.


== History ==
SUIIT was set up in 2010 as a self-financing institute of Sambalpur University and is the first technical institute which was to be set up in a general university after 2002 in Odisha. SUIIT is the brainchild of former vice-chancellor Prof Arun Pujari. Most of the courses being offered by the SUIIT were pulled out from different existing departments of Sambalpur University. Electronics was taken out of physics department, computer science from mathematics while bioinformatics was pulled out from life sciences department. Only the undergraduate courses newly add in SUIIT.
