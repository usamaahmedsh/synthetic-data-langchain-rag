== Biography ==
Menyuk was born in New York City and attended Hunter College High School. She received her Bachelor of Science in Speech Sciences from New York University in 1951. She worked as a chief language therapist at Massachusetts General Hospital before pursuing her Masters of Education in Speech and Hearing from Boston University. Menyuk continued on to receive her Doctor of Education in Psycholinguistics from Boston University in 1961. She  completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied with Noam Chomsky, before returning to Boston University for the rest of her academic career.   
Menyuk rose as a leading expert in child language development and disorders and eventually obtained the rank of Professor Emerita in the Developmental Studies and Applied Linguistics program at Boston University.  Menyuk retired from Boston University in 1998.  
Menyuk's research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Army. 
Outside of scholarly work Menyuk had a passion for safe environmental implementation.  


== Research ==
Menyuk's research focused on the linguistic behavior of children and adolescents, covering topics such as the development of spoken language, prosody, metalinguistic awareness, and reading.  Other work examined language development in children specifically impacted by otitis media.  Menyuk's research has been described as aligning with Chomsky's theoretical perspective and centered around explaining how the faculty of language matures during childhood.

Menyuk was a Fulbright Fellow in 1971 and in 1989. Menyuk received the Honors of the Association award from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and earned the rank of Fellow within the organization.
