In directional statistics, the von Mises–Fisher distribution (named after Richard von Mises and Ronald Fisher), is a probability distribution on the 
  
    
      
        (
        p
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (p-1)}
  
-sphere in 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{p}}
  
. If 
  
    
      
        p
        =
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle p=2}
  

the distribution reduces to the von Mises distribution on the circle.

    {\displaystyle C_{3}(\kappa )={\frac {\kappa }{4\pi \sinh \kappa }}={\frac {\kappa }{2\pi (e^{\kappa }-e^{-\kappa })}}.}
  

The parameters 
  
    
      
        
          μ
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        κ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa }
  
 are called the mean direction and concentration parameter, respectively. The greater the value of 
  
    
      
        κ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa }
  
, the higher the concentration of the distribution around the mean direction 
  
    
      
        
          μ
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}}
  
. The distribution is unimodal for 
  
    
      
        κ
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa >0}
  
, and is uniform on the sphere for 
  
    
      
        κ
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa =0}
  
.
The von Mises–Fisher distribution for 
  
    
      
        p
        =
        3
      
    
    {\displaystyle p=3}
  
 is also called the Fisher distribution.
It was first used to model the interaction of electric dipoles in an electric field. Other applications are found in geology, bioinformatics, and text mining.


=== Support ===
The support of the von Mises–Fisher distribution is the hypersphere, or more specifically, the

        −
        1

=== Note on the normalization constant ===
In the textbook, Directional Statistics  by Mardia and Jupp, the normalization constant given for the von Mises Fisher (VMF) probability density is apparently different from the one given here: 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            p
          
        
        (
        κ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{p}(\kappa )}
  
. In that book, for 
  
    
      
        
          VMF
        
        (
        
          μ
        
        ,
        κ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{VMF}}({\boldsymbol {\mu }},\kappa )}
  
 the normalization constant is specified as:

  
    
      
        
          C
          
            p

              κ
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{p}^{*}(\kappa )={\frac {({\frac {\kappa }{2}})^{p/2-1}}{\Gamma (p/2)I_{p/2-1}(\kappa )}}}
  

where 
  
    
      
        Γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma }
  
 is the gamma function. This is resolved by noting that Mardia and Jupp give the density "with respect to the uniform distribution", while the density here is specified with respect to  scaled Hausdorff measure,

    {\displaystyle C_{p}(0)={\frac {\Gamma (p/2)}{2\pi ^{p/2}}}}
  

It then follows that:

  
    
      
        
          C
          
            p
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        κ
        )
        =
        
          
            
              
                C
                
                  p
                
              
              (
              κ
              )
            
            
              
                C
                
                  p
                
              
              (
              0
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{p}^{*}(\kappa )={\frac {C_{p}(\kappa )}{C_{p}(0)}}}
  

While the value for 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            p

        0
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{p}(0)}
  
 was derived above via the surface area, the same result may be obtained by setting 
  
    
      
        κ
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa =0}
  
 in the above formula for 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            p
          
        
        (
        κ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{p}(\kappa )}
  
. This can be done by noting that the series expansion for 
  
    
      
        
          I
          
            p

    {\displaystyle \kappa ^{p/2-1}}
  
 has but one non-zero term at 
  
    
      
        κ
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa =0}
  
. (To evaluate that term, one needs to use the definition 
  
    
      
        
          0
          
            0
          
        
        =

More succinctly, the restriction of any isotropic multivariate normal density to the unit hypersphere gives a von Mises–Fisher density, up to normalization.

This construction can be generalized by starting with a normal distribution with a general covariance matrix, in which case restricting to 
  
    
      
        
          ‖
          
            x

        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {x} \right\|=1}
  
 gives the Fisher-Bingham distribution.
Restriction is not to be confused with projection. If

        ∼

        ,
        
          Σ
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {z} \sim {\mathcal {N}}_{p}({\boldsymbol {\mu }},{\boldsymbol {\Sigma }})}
  
, which we project onto the unitsphere: 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
        =
        ‖
        
          z

          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =\lVert \mathbf {z} \rVert ^{-1}\mathbf {z} }
  
, we get the projected normal distribution. (Informally, restriction can be thought of as rejection sampling with an infinite sampling budget, where we keep only those 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {z} }
  
 that land on the unitsphere, while with projection we use all samples.)

== Expected value ==
The expected value of the von Mises–Fisher distribution is not on the unit hypersphere, but instead has a length of less than one. This length is given by 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            p
          
        
        (
        κ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{p}(\kappa )}
  
 as defined above. For a von Mises–Fisher distribution with mean direction 
  
    
      
        
          μ
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}}
  
 and concentration 
  
    
      
        κ
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa >0}
  
, the expected value is: 

  
    
      
        
          A
          
            p
          
        
        (
        κ
        )
        
          μ
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{p}(\kappa ){\boldsymbol {\mu }}}
  
. 
For 
  
    
      
        κ
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa =0}
  
, the expected value is at the origin. For finite 
  
    
      
        κ
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa >0}
  
, the length of the expected value is strictly between zero and one and is a monotonic rising function of 
  
    
      
        κ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \kappa }
  
.
The empirical mean (arithmetic average) of a collection of points on the unit hypersphere behaves in a similar manner, being close to the origin for widely  spread data and close to the sphere for concentrated data. Indeed, for the von Mises–Fisher distribution, the expected value of the maximum-likelihood estimate based on a collection of points is equal to the empirical mean of those points.


== Entropy and KL divergence ==
The expected value can be used to compute differential entropy and KL divergence.

== Transformation ==
Von Mises–Fisher (VMF) distributions are closed under orthogonal linear transforms. Let 
  
    
      
        
          U
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} }
  
 be a 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  
-by-
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  
 orthogonal matrix. Let 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
        ∼
        
          VMF
        
        (
        
          μ
        
        ,
        κ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \sim {\text{VMF}}({\boldsymbol {\mu }},\kappa )}
  
 and apply the invertible linear transform: 
  
    
      
        
          y
        
        =
        
          U
          x
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} =\mathbf {Ux} }
  
. The inverse transform is 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
        =
        
          
            U
            ′
          
          y
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =\mathbf {U'y} }
  
, because the inverse of an orthogonal matrix is its transpose: 
  
    
      
        
          
            U
          
          
            −
            1
          
        
        =
        
          
            U
          
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} ^{-1}=\mathbf {U} '}
  
. The Jacobian of the transform is 
  
    
      
        
          U
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} }
  
, for which the absolute value of its determinant is 1, also because of the orthogonality. Using these facts and the form of the VMF density, it follows that:  

  
    
      
        
          y
        
        ∼
        
          VMF
        
        (
        
          U
        
        
          μ
        
        ,
        κ
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} \sim {\text{VMF}}(\mathbf {U} {\boldsymbol {\mu }},\kappa ).}
  

One may verify that since 
  
    
      
        
          μ
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
  
 are unit vectors, then by the orthogonality, so are 
  
    
      
        
          U
        
        
          μ
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} {\boldsymbol {\mu }}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          y
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} }
  
.

=== Distribution of dot-products ===
In machine learning, especially in image classification, to-be-classified inputs (e.g. images) are often compared using cosine similarity, which is the dot product between intermediate representations in the form of unitvectors (termed embeddings). The dimensionality is typically high, with 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  
 at least several hundreds. The deep neural networks that extract embeddings for classification should learn to spread the classes as far apart as possible and ideally this should give classes that are uniformly distributed on 
  
    
      
        
          
            S
          
          
            p
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{p-1}}
  
. For a better statistical understanding of across-class cosine similarity, the distribution of dot-products between unitvectors independently sampled from the uniform distribution may be helpful.
