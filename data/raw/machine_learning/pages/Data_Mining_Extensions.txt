Data Mining Extensions (DMX) is a query language for data mining models supported by Microsoft's SQL Server Analysis Services product.
Like SQL, it supports a data definition language (DDL), data manipulation language (DML) and a data query language (DQL), all three with SQL-like syntax. Whereas SQL statements operate on relational tables, DMX statements operate on data mining models. Similarly, Microsoft SQL Server supports the MDX language for OLAP databases. DMX is used to create and train data mining models, and to browse, manage, and predict against them. DMX is composed of data definition language (DDL) statements, data manipulation language (DML) statements, and functions and operators.


== Queries ==
DMX Queries are formulated using the SELECT statement.
They can extract information from existing data mining models in various ways.


== Data definition language ==
The data definition language (DDL) part of DMX can be used to

Create new data mining models and mining structures - CREATE MINING STRUCTURE, CREATE MINING MODEL
Delete existing data mining models and mining structures - DROP MINING STRUCTURE, DROP MINING MODEL
Export and import mining structures - EXPORT, IMPORT
Copy data from one mining model to another - SELECT INTO


== Data manipulation language ==
The data manipulation language (DML) part of DMX can be used to

Train mining models - INSERT INTO
Browse data in mining models - SELECT FROM
Make predictions using mining model - SELECT ... FROM PREDICTION JOIN


== Example: a prediction query ==
This example is a singleton prediction query, which predicts for the given customer whether she will be interested in home loan products.
