This is a comprehensive list of volunteer computing projects, which are a type of distributed computing where volunteers donate computing time to specific causes. The donated computing power comes from idle CPUs and GPUs in personal computers, video game consoles, and Android devices.
Each project seeks to utilize the computing power of many internet connected devices to solve problems and perform tedious, repetitive research in a very cost effective manner.
