Independent reading is a term used in educational settings, where students are involved in choosing and reading material (fiction books, non-fiction, magazine, other media) for their independent consumption and enjoyment. Students that read independently have an emphasized creative choice in what they want to read and choose to learn.  Usually, independent reading takes place alongside the ongoing curriculum in the classroom or homeschool.  Independent reading can be tied to assessment and evaluation or remain as an activity in itself.
