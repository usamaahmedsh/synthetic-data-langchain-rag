Roberta Sinatra is an Italian scientist and associate professor at the IT University of Copenhagen. She is known for her work in network science and conducts research on quantifying success in science.


== Early life and education ==
Sinatra received her undergraduate degree from the University of Catania in 2005. She received her M.Sc. in theoretical physics from the same university in 2007 and, in 2008, an M.Sc. (Eccellenza Specialistica) from the Scuola superiore di Catania. She went on to earn a Ph.D in physics from the University of Catania in 2012, working with Vito Latora and Jesús Gómez-Gardeñes. She then held postdoctoral and associate research scientist positions  at Northeastern University and Dana Farber Cancer Institute. She joined  IT University of Copenhagen in 2019.


== Research and career ==
Sinatra is known for her research on the social determinants of success, using large-scale data sets and methods from statistical physics, machine learning and network science. Her early work was on cooperation in games. She has subsequently quantified performance and success in scientific and creative careers, as well as in art and culture. Through her research, she addressed gender inequality in academic publishing and the importance of luck in success.
