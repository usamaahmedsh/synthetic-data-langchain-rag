PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for programming in Python. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems, and supports web development with Django. PyCharm is developed by the Czech company JetBrains and built on their IntelliJ platform.
PyCharm is cross-platform, working on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.  Portions of PyCharm's source code are released under the Apache License and available on GitHub, and a subscription is available to gain access to proprietary features.

== History ==
PyCharm was released to the market of the Python-focused IDEs to compete with PyDev (for Eclipse)  or the more broadly focused Komodo IDE by ActiveState.
The beta version of the product was released in July 2010, with the 1.0 arriving 3 months later. Version 2.0 was released on December 13, 2011, version 3.0 was released on September 24, 2013, and version 4.0 was released on November 19, 2014.
PyCharm became open source on October 22, 2013. The open source variant is released under the name Community Edition while the commercial variant, Professional Edition, contains closed-source modules.
As of December 2022, JetBrains has discontinued PyCharm Edu and IntelliJ IDEA Edu. The educational functionality is now bundled with the Community and Professional editions of IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm. Users are encouraged to install the Community or Professional editions and enable educational features through the IDE settings.
In April 2025, PyCharm Professional Edition and PyCharm Community Edition were merged into a "unified product", now simply called PyCharm. The new version of PyCharm can be used free of charge, with a licensing fee available to gain access to features previously exclusive to the Professional Edition.


== Licensing ==
Portions of PyCharm's source code are distributed under the Apache 2 license. The source code is available on GitHub. A Pro subscription can be purchased to gain access to additional features, primarily geared towards a faster workflow and machine learning tools; however, the core IDE can be used free of charge.


== Limitations ==
The PyCharm Python IDE does not feature a GUI builder for now. While there is no native GUI builder provided within PyCharm, by using PySide6/PyQt6 (the Python bindings to Qt V6), one can gain access to the Qt Widget Designer graphical UI builder.
