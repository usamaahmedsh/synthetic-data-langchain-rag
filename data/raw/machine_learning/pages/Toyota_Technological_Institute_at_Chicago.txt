Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC or TTI-Chicago) is a private graduate school and research institute focused on computer science and located in Chicago, Illinois within the University of Chicago campus. It is supported by the earnings on an endowment of approximately $255 million as well as by the income from research awards received by its faculty.


== History ==
TTIC was founded by the Toyota Technological Institute (TTI), in Nagoya in Japan, a small private engineering school with an endowment provided by the Toyota Motor Corporation. TTI established TTIC as an independent computer science institute with the intention of creating a world-class institution. In addition to historical ties, there remains active collaboration between TTIC and TTI in Nagoya. However, TTIC has no formal ties with either TTI or the Toyota Motor Corporation.
TTIC officially opened for operation in September 2003 and three students entered its Ph.D. program in September 2004.
