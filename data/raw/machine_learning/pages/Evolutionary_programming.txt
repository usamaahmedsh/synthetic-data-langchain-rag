Evolutionary programming is an evolutionary algorithm, where a share of new population is created by mutation of previous population without crossover. Evolutionary programming differs from evolution strategy ES(
  
    
      
        μ
        +
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu +\lambda }
  
) in one detail. All individuals are selected for the new population, while in ES(
  
    
      
        μ
        +
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu +\lambda }
  
), every individual has the same probability to be selected. It is one of the four major evolutionary algorithm paradigms.

It was first used by Lawrence J. Fogel in the US in 1960 in order to use simulated evolution as a learning process aiming to generate artificial intelligence. It was used to evolve finite-state machines as predictors.
