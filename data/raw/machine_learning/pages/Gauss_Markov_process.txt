Gauss–Markov stochastic processes (named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov) are stochastic processes that satisfy the requirements for both Gaussian processes and Markov processes. A stationary Gauss–Markov process is unique up to rescaling; such a process is also known as an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process.
Gauss–Markov processes obey Langevin equations.


== Basic properties ==
Every Gauss–Markov process X(t) possesses the three following properties:

If h(t) is a non-zero scalar function of t, then Z(t) = h(t)X(t) is also a Gauss–Markov process
If f(t) is a non-decreasing scalar function of t, then Z(t) = X(f(t)) is also a Gauss–Markov process
If the process is non-degenerate and mean-square continuous, then there exists a non-zero scalar function h(t) and a strictly increasing scalar function f(t) such that X(t) = h(t)W(f(t)), where W(t) is the standard Wiener process.
Property (3) means that every non-degenerate mean-square continuous Gauss–Markov process can be synthesized from the standard Wiener process (SWP).

 which is important in Wiener filtering and other areas.
There are also some trivial exceptions to all of the above.
