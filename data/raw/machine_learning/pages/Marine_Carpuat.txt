== Education ==
Marine Carpuat obtained her MPhil and PhD from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2008 under the supervision of Dekai Wu. Her PhD thesis was on the topic of machine translation, and demonstrated the first results showing that explicit modeling of lexical semantics could improve the accuracy of a machine translation system.


== Career ==
After completing her education, Carpuat worked at the National Research Council Canada as a researcher. 
In 2015, she joined University of Maryland as an assistant professor in Computer Science where she is a member of the CLIP lab. Carpuat works in the area of natural language processing with a focus on machine translation and cross-lingual semantics. She has published over 100 peer-reviewed research papers.
Her work is published in the proceedings of computer science conferences, including the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.
