The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Impact Summit hosted by India is to be held in Delhi from 19 to 20 February 2026. It follows the AI Action Summit in Paris in February 2025, the 2024 AI Seoul Summit in 2024 and the Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit in 2023.
The summit will mark a further step away from governmental concerns about the safety of AI.  According to professional services firm Crowell: "It looks to shift the AI conversation from the AI “Safety” and “Action” themes of the earlier summits to one focused on “Impact.” This represents a strategic evolution from previous convenings to move beyond governance and safety-focused dialogues, to one that drives implementation and measurable outcomes, particularly for deployment across the Global South, and strong multi-sectoral collaboration."
