In probability theory, the telegraph process is a memoryless continuous-time stochastic process that shows two distinct values. It models burst noise (also called popcorn noise or random telegraph signal). If the two possible values that a random variable can take are

One can also calculate a correlation function:

        =
        
          e
          
            −
            2
            λ
            
              |
            
            t
            −
            u
            
              |
            
          
        
        var
        ⁡
        {
        X
        
          }
          
            s
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle X(t),X(u)\rangle _{s}=e^{-2\lambda |t-u|}\operatorname {var} \{X\}_{s}.}
  


== Application ==
This random process finds wide application in model building:

In physics, spin systems and fluorescence intermittency show dichotomous properties. But especially in single molecule experiments probability distributions featuring algebraic tails are used instead of the exponential distribution implied in all formulas above.
In finance for describing stock prices
In biology for describing transcription factor binding and unbinding.
