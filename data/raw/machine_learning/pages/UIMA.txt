UIMA ( yoo-EE-mə), short for Unstructured Information Management Architecture, is an OASIS standard  for content analytics, originally developed at IBM.  It provides a component software architecture for the development, discovery, composition, and deployment of multi-modal analytics for the analysis of unstructured information and integration with search technologies.


== Structure ==
The UIMA architecture can be thought of in four dimensions:

It specifies component interfaces in an analytics pipeline.
It describes a set of design patterns.
It suggests two data representations: an in-memory representation of annotations for high-performance analytics and an XML representation of annotations for integration with remote web services.
It suggests development roles allowing tools to be used by users with diverse skills.


== Implementations and uses ==
 
Apache UIMA, a reference implementation of UIMA, is maintained by the Apache Software Foundation.
UIMA is used in a number of software projects:

IBM Research's Watson uses UIMA for analyzing unstructured data.
The Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (Apache cTAKES) is a UIMA-based system for information extraction from medical records.
DKPro Core is a collection of reusable UIMA components for general-purpose natural language processing.
