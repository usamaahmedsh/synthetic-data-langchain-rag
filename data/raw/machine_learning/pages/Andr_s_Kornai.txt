András Kornai (born 1957 in Budapest), son of economist János Kornai, is a mathematical linguist. He has earned two PhDs. He earned his first in Mathematics in 1983 from Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, where his advisor was Miklós Ajtai, and his second in Linguistics in 1991 from Stanford University, where his advisor was Paul Kiparsky.
He is a professor in the Department of Algebra at the Budapest Institute of Technology, where he works on an open source Hungarian morphological analyzer. He was Chief Scientist at MetaCarta, where he worked on information extraction before the company was acquired by Nokia. Prior to MetaCarta, he was Chief Scientist at Northern Light.
He is on the board of the journal Grammars and YourAmigo PLC. His research interests include all mathematical aspects of natural language processing, speech recognition, and OCR.
As Area Editor he was responsible for the Mathematical Linguistics area of the Oxford International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, and his joint work with Geoffrey Pullum, "The X-bar Theory of Phrase Structure", formally reconstructed that then-popular linguistic theory.
