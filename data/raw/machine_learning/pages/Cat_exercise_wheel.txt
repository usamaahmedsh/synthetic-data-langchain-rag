A cat exercise wheel is a large wheel on which a cat either runs on or walks on for exercise or play. A cat wheel looks like a large hamster wheel: the wheel turns due to the weight of the cat as it walks. A wheel can be used for enrichment or to exercise high-energy indoor cats.


== Indoor cats ==
Cats kept in homes or small apartments may not have opportunities to run outdoors or otherwise exercise a considerable amount. A cat wheel can assist cats in maintaining a healthy weight and body condition, as well as providing mental stimulation and a form of play.
