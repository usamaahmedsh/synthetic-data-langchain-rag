== History ==
AppTek was acquired in 1998 by Lernout & Hauspie (at the time a NASDAQ publicly traded company), AppTek organized a management buy-out and went private again in 2001. In 2014, the company sold its hybrid machine translation technology to eBay and has since rebuilt the platform to modern neural-based approaches for machine translation. In 2020, SOSi acquired non-controlling interest in AppTek and became an exclusive reseller of AppTek products for U.S. federal, state, and local government entities.
