Within statistical factor analysis, the factor regression model, or hybrid factor model, is a special multivariate model with the following form:

  
    
      
        
          
            y

== Relationship between factor regression model, factor model and regression model ==
The factor regression model can be viewed as a combination of factor analysis model (
  
    
      
        
          
            y

          A
        
        
          
            x
          
          
            n
          
        
        +
        
          c

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} _{n}=\mathbf {A} \mathbf {x} _{n}+\mathbf {c} +\mathbf {e} _{n}}
  
) and regression model (
  
    
      
        
          
            y
          
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          B
        
        
          
            z
          
          
            n

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} _{n}=\mathbf {B} \mathbf {z} _{n}+\mathbf {c} +\mathbf {e} _{n}}
  
).
Alternatively, the model can be viewed as a special kind of factor model, the hybrid factor model
