Xu Li is a Chinese computer scientist and co-founder and current CEO of SenseTime, an artificial intelligence (AI) company. Xu has led SenseTime since the company's incorporation and helped it independently develop its proprietary deep learning platform.


== Education and research ==
Xu obtained both his bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He received his doctorate in computer science from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
Xu has published more than 50 papers at international conferences and in journals in the field of computer vision and won the Best Paper Award at the international conference on Non-Photorealistic Rendering and Animation (NPAR) 2012 and the Best Reviewer Award at the international conferences Asian Conference on Computer Vision ACCV 2012 and International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2015. He has three algorithms that have been included into the visual open-source platform OpenCV, and his "L0 Smoothing" algorithm garnered the most citations in research papers over a span of five years (2011–2015) within the ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), a scientific journal that Thomson Reuters InCites has placed first among software engineering journals.


== Career ==
Previously, Xu worked at Lenovo Corporate Research & Development. He  was also a visiting researcher at Motorola China R&D Institute, Omron Research Institute, and Microsoft Research.
