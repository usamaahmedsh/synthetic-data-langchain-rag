In the theory of probability, the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem (sometimes referred to as the fundamental theorem of statistics), named after Valery Ivanovich Glivenko and Francesco Paolo Cantelli, describes the asymptotic behaviour of the empirical distribution function as the number of independent and identically distributed observations grows. Specifically, the empirical distribution function converges uniformly to the true distribution function almost surely.
The uniform convergence of  more general empirical measures becomes an important property of the Glivenko–Cantelli classes of functions or sets.  The Glivenko–Cantelli classes arise in Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory, with applications to machine learning. Applications can be found in econometrics making use of M-estimators.

    {\displaystyle F(x)=\operatorname {\mathbb {E} } {\bigl [}1_{X_{1}\leq x}{\bigr ]}.}
  
 The Glivenko–Cantelli theorem gives a stronger mode of convergence than this in the iid case.
An even stronger uniform convergence result for the empirical distribution function is available in the form of an extended type of law of the iterated logarithm. See asymptotic properties of the empirical distribution function for this and related results.

 is the indicator function of each set

Further generalization is the map induced by

Then it becomes an important property of these classes whether the strong law of large numbers holds uniformly on

            F

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}_{0}}
  
 is dominated by an integrable function

  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 is a Glivenko-Cantelli class

Theorem (Dudley, Giné, and Zinn, 1991)

Suppose that a function class 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 is bounded. Also suppose that the set 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              F
            
          
          
            0
          
        
        =
        {
        f

        inf
        f

        f

            F
          
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}_{0}=\{f-\inf f\mid f\in {\mathcal {F}}\}}
  
 is image-admissible Suslin. Then 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  
 is a weak uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class if and only if it is a strong uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class.
The following theorem is central to statistical learning of binary classification tasks.
Theorem (Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1968)

Under certain consistency conditions, a universally measurable class of sets 
  
    
      
         
        
          
            C
          
        
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ {\mathcal {C}}\ }
  
 is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class if and only if it is a Vapnik–Chervonenkis class.
There exist a variety of consistency conditions for the equivalence of uniform Glivenko-Cantelli and Vapnik-Chervonenkis classes. In particular, either of the following conditions for a class 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
  
 suffice:

  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
  
 is image-admissible Suslin.

  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
  
 is universally separable: There exists a countable subset 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              C
              
                0
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C_{0}}}}
  
 of 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
  
 such that each set 
  
    
      
        C
        ∈
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle C\in {\mathcal {C}}}
  
 can be written as the pointwise limit of sets in 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              C
            
          
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}_{0}}
  
.

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}=\{(-\infty ,t]:t\in {\mathbb {R} }\}}
  
. The classical Glivenko–Cantelli theorem implies that this class is a universal GC class. Furthermore, by Kolmogorov's theorem,
