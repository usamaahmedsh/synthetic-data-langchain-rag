In probability theory, a superprocess is a measure-valued stochastic process that is usually constructed as a special limit of near-critical branching diffusions.
Informally, a superprocess can be seen as a branching process where each particle splits and dies at infinite rates, and evolves in a state space E according to a diffusion equation. We follow the rescaled population of particles, seen as a measure on E.

=== Simplest setting ===

For any integer 
  
    
      
        N
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle N\geq 1}
  
, consider a branching Brownian process 
  
    
      
        
          Y
          
            N
          
        
        (
        t
        ,
        d
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y^{N}(t,dx)}
  
 defined as follows:

Start at 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=0}
  
 with 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
  
 independent particles distributed according to a probability distribution 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  
.
Each particle independently move according to a Brownian motion.
Each particle independently dies with rate 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
  
.
When a particle dies, with probability 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/2}
  
 it gives birth to two offspring in the same location.
The notation 
  
    
      
        
          Y
          
            N
          
        
        (
        t
        ,
        d
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y^{N}(t,dx)}
  
 means should be interpreted as: at each time 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  
, the number of particles in a set 
  
    
      
        A
        ⊂
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\subset \mathbb {R} }
  
 is 
  
    
      
        
          Y
          
            N
          
        
        (
        t
        ,
        A
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y^{N}(t,A)}
  
. In other words, 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  
 is a measure-valued random process.
Now, define a renormalized process:

  
    
      
        
          X
          
            N
          
        
        (
        t
        ,
        d
        x
        )
        :=
        
          
            1
            N
          
        
        
          Y
          
            N
          
        
        (
        t
        ,
        d
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle X^{N}(t,dx):={\frac {1}{N}}Y^{N}(t,dx)}
  

Then the finite-dimensional distributions of 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            N
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X^{N}}
  
 converge as 
  
    
      
        N
        →
        +
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle N\to +\infty }
  
 to those of a measure-valued random process 
  
    
      
        X
        (
        t
        ,
        d
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle X(t,dx)}
  
, which is called a

-superprocess, with initial value 
  
    
      
        X
        (
        0
        )
        =
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle X(0)=\mu }
  
, where 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        (
        z
        )
        :=

 and where 
  
    
      
        ξ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \xi }
  
 is a Brownian motion (specifically, 
  
    
      
        ξ
        =
        (
        Ω

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \xi =(\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},{\mathcal {F}}_{t},\xi _{t},{\textbf {P}}_{x})}
  
 where 
  
    
      
        (
        Ω
        ,
        
          
            F
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}})}
  
 is a measurable space, 
  
    
      
        (
        
          
            
              F
            
          
          
            t

            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {F}}_{t})_{t\geq 0}}
  
 is a filtration, and 
  
    
      
        
          ξ
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \xi _{t}}
  
 under 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              P
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {P}}_{x}}
  
 has the law of a Brownian motion started at 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
). 
As will be clarified in the next section, 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
  
 encodes an underlying branching mechanism, and 
  
    
      
        ξ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \xi }
  
 encodes the motion of the particles. Here, since 
  
    
      
        ξ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \xi }
  
 is a Brownian motion, the resulting object is known as a Super-brownian motion.


=== Generalization to (ξ, ϕ)-superprocesses ===
Our discrete branching system 
  
    
      
        
          Y
          
            N
          
        
        (
        t
        ,
        d
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y^{N}(t,dx)}
  
 can be much more sophisticated, leading to a variety of superprocesses:

Instead of 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  
, the state space can now be any Lusin space 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  
.
The underlying motion of the particles can now be given by 
  
    
      
        ξ
        =
        (
        Ω
        ,
        
          
            F
          
        
        ,
        
          
            
              F
            
          
          
            t
          
        
        ,
        
          ξ
          
            t
          
        
        ,
        
          
            
              P
            
          
          
            x
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \xi =(\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},{\mathcal {F}}_{t},\xi _{t},{\textbf {P}}_{x})}
  
, where 
  
    
      
        
          ξ
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \xi _{t}}
  
 is a càdlàg Markov process (see, Chapter 4, for details).
A particle dies at rate 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            N
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma _{N}}
  

When a particle dies at time 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  
, located in 
  
    
      
        
          ξ
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \xi _{t}}
  
, it gives birth to a random number of offspring 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            t
            ,
            
              ξ
              
                t
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n_{t,\xi _{t}}}
  
. These offspring start to move from 
  
    
      
        
          ξ
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \xi _{t}}
  
. We require that the law of 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            t
            ,
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n_{t,x}}
  
 depends solely on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
, and that all

            ,
            x
          
        
        
          )
          
            t
            ,
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (n_{t,x})_{t,x}}
  
 are independent. Set 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            k
          
        
        (

        )
        =
        
          P
        
        [
        
          n
          
            t
            ,

        k
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{k}(x)=\mathbb {P} [n_{t,x}=k]}
  
 and define 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  
 the associated probability-generating function:
  
    
      
        g
        (
        x
        ,
        z
        )
        :=
        
          ∑

            =

            ∞
          
        
        
          p
          
            k

    {\textstyle g(x,z):=\sum \limits _{k=0}^{\infty }p_{k}(x)z^{k}}
  

Add the following requirement that the expected number of offspring is bounded:
  
    
      
        
          sup
          
            x

Define

One of the most important properties of superprocesses is that they are intimately connected with certain nonlinear partial differential equations. The simplest such equation is

        u

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta u-u^{2}=0\ on\ \mathbb {R} ^{d}.}
  
 When the spatial motion (migration) is a diffusion process, one talks about a superdiffusion. The connection between superdiffusions  and nonlinear PDE's is similar to the one between diffusions and linear PDE's.
