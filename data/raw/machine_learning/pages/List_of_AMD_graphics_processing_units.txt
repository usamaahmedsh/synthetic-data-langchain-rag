The following is a list that contains general information about GPUs, and other video cards, made by AMD, including those made by ATI Technologies before 2006, based on official specifications in table-form.


== Field explanations ==
The headers in the table listed below describe the following:

Model – The marketing name for the GPU assigned by AMD/ATI. Note that ATI trademarks have been replaced by AMD trademarks starting with the Radeon HD 6000 series for desktop and AMD FirePro series for professional graphics.
Codename – The internal engineering codename for the GPU.
Launch – Date of release for the GPU.
Architecture – The microarchitecture used by the GPU.
Fab – Fabrication process. Average feature size of components of the GPU.
Transistors – Number of transistors on the die.
Die size – Physical surface area of the die.
Core config – The layout of the graphics pipeline, in terms of functional units.
Core clock – The reference base and boost (if available) core clock frequency.
Fillrate
Pixel - The rate at which pixels can be rendered by the raster operators to a display. Measured in pixels/s.
Texture - The rate at which textures can be mapped by the texture mapping units onto a polygon mesh. Measured in texels/s.
Performance
Shader operations - How many operations the pixel shaders (or unified shaders in Direct3D 10 and newer GPUs) can perform. Measured in operations/s.
Vertex operations - The amount of geometry operations that can be processed on the vertex shaders in one second (only applies to Direct3D 9.0c and older GPUs). Measured in vertices/s.
Memory
Bus type – Type of memory bus utilized.
Bus width – Maximum bit width of the memory bus utilized.
Size – Size of the graphics memory.
Clock – The reference memory clock frequency.
Bandwidth – Maximum theoretical memory bandwidth based on bus type and width.
TDP (Thermal design power) – Maximum amount of heat generated by the GPU chip, measured in Watt.
TBP (Typical board power) – Typical power drawn by the total board, including power for the GPU chip and peripheral equipment, such as Voltage regulator module, memory, fans, etc., measured in Watt.
Bus interface – Bus by which the graphics processor is attached to the system (typically an expansion slot, such as PCI, AGP, or PCIe).
API support – Rendering and computing APIs supported by the GPU and driver.
Due to conventions changing over time, some numerical definitions such as core config, core clock, performance and memory should not be compared one-to-one across generations. The following tables are for reference use only, and do not reflect actual performance.
