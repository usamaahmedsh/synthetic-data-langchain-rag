=== Founding and early development (2005–2012) ===
Docebo was founded in 2005 by Claudio Erba and in its formative years, Docebo primarily operated within Italy. The company secured its first round of funding in 2012: €2.4 million from Principia SGR, an Italian venture capital firm, marking an early milestone in its financial growth.


=== North American expansion and internationalization (2012–2016) ===
Following its initial success, Docebo embarked on an internationalization strategy. In 2013, the company established its first U.S. office in Athens, Georgia. Docebo received its second venture-backed financing round in 2015: $3 million from Klass Capital, a Canadian firm. This investment supported the company's continued growth in the region and led to the establishment of its corporate headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Docebo now operates in the global market with offices in Athens, GA; Toronto; London; Paris; Berlin; Biassono; Melbourne; and Dubai. 


=== Public listings (2019–2020) ===
Docebo transitioned to a public company with its initial public offering (IPO) on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on October 8, 2019. This Canadian IPO raised gross proceeds of C$75 million. Building on this public market presence, Docebo expanded its reach by commencing trading in the United States on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "DCBO" on December 7, 2020. This U.S. IPO generated gross proceeds of $144 million.


=== CEO succession (2023–2024) ===
