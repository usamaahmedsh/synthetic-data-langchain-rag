ALOPEX (an abbreviation of "algorithms of pattern extraction") is a correlation based machine learning algorithm first proposed by Tzanakou and Harth in 1974.


== Principle ==
In machine learning, the goal is to train a system to minimize a cost function or (referring to ALOPEX) a response function.  Many training algorithms, such as backpropagation, have an inherent susceptibility to getting "stuck" in local minima or maxima of the response function.  ALOPEX uses a cross-correlation of differences and a stochastic process to overcome this in an attempt to reach the absolute minimum (or maximum) of the response function.


== Method ==
ALOPEX, in its simplest form is defined by an updating equation:

  
    
      
        Δ
         
        
          W
          
            i
            j
          
        
        (
        n
        )
        =
        γ
         
        Δ
         
        
          W
          
            i
            j
          
        
        (
        n
        −
        1
        )
        Δ
         
        R
        (
        n
        )
        +
        
          r
          
            i
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta \ W_{ij}(n)=\gamma \ \Delta \ W_{ij}(n-1)\Delta \ R(n)+r_{i}(n)}
  

where:

  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq 0}
  
 is the iteration or time-step.

  
    
      
        Δ
         
        
          W
          
            i
            j
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta \ W_{ij}(n)}
  
 is the difference between the current and previous value of system variable 
  
    
      
         
        
          W
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ W_{ij}}
  
 at iteration 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
.

  
    
      
        Δ
         
        R
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta \ R(n)}
  
 is the difference between the current and previous value of the response function 
  
    
      
         
        R
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ R,}
  
 at iteration 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
.

  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
  
 is the learning rate parameter 
  
    
      
        (
        γ
         
        <
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\gamma \ <0}
  
 minimizes 
  
    
      
        R
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle R,}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        γ
         
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma \ >0}
  
 maximizes 
  
    
      
        R
         
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle R\ )}
  

  
    
      
        
          r
          
            i
          
        
        (
        n
        )
        ∼
         
        N
        (
        0
        ,
        σ
        
           
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{i}(n)\sim \ N(0,\sigma \ ^{2})}
  


== Discussion ==
Essentially, ALOPEX changes each system variable 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            i
            j
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{ij}(n)}
  
 based on a product of: the previous change in the variable 
  
    
      
        Δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta }
  

  
    
      
        
          W
          
            i
            j
          
        
        (
        n
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{ij}(n-1)}
  
, the resulting change in the cost function 
  
    
      
        Δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta }
  

  
    
      
        R
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle R(n)}
  
, and the learning rate parameter 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
  
.  Further, to find the absolute minimum (or maximum), the stochastic process 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            i
            j
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{ij}(n)}
  
 (Gaussian or other) is added to stochastically "push" the algorithm out of any local minima.
