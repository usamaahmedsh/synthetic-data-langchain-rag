Sky Switzerland is a Swiss media company based in Neuchâtel, which supplies over-the-top pay television and video on demand accessible through the Internet in Switzerland.


== History ==
Homedia was founded in 2003 by Renzo del Mastro and Sébastien D'Amico, which offered DVD rental services, was later expanded from a DVD rental into the biggest independent OTT VOD platform in Switzerland with their video-on-demand service HollyStar. In May 2017, Sky Deutschland purchased Swiss online-video service HollyStar and its owner Homedia with Homedia being rebranded as Sky Switzerland on 3 January 2018. Before the takeover, Teleclub had the broadcast rights for certain Sky content in Switzerland with some of that content being seen on channels from Swisscom TV, Sunrise TV and UPC TV. Now as Sky Switzerland, it subsequently launched Sky Sport as an OTT service in Switzerland, followed by an OTT entertainment service known as Sky Show in 2018.

In August 2017, Sky Deutschland announced it would launch Sky Sport in Switzerland as an OTT provider on 17 August 2017. Sky Sport channels are also available via Liberty Global-owned UPC Switzerland, previously only available on Swisscom-owned provider Teleclub.
On 18 September 2018, it was announced that Sky Switzerland would enter a partnership with UPC Switzerland-owned Mysports, which owns the rights to a number of domestic competitions including the ice hockey National League. Via an additional subscription, all MySports channels can be streamed on Sky Switzerland.
Sky Sport had over 400,000 viewers aged 15 and over in Switzerland in 2023 (5.9% of the population). In German-speaking Switzerland, the number of users was around 4% higher than in French-speaking Switzerland.
