Processor may refer to:


== Computing ==


=== Hardware ===
Processor (computing)
Central processing unit (CPU), the hardware within a computer that executes a program
Microprocessor, a central processing unit contained on a single integrated circuit (IC)
Application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP), a component used in system-on-a-chip design
Boot processor, a processor that initialize hardware on boot process, usually integrated on CPU or SoC
Graphics processing unit (GPU), a processor designed for doing dedicated graphics-rendering computations
Physics processing unit (PPU), a dedicated microprocessor designed to handle the calculations of physics
Digital signal processor (DSP), a specialized microprocessor designed specifically for digital signal processing
Image processor, a specialized DSP used for image processing in digital cameras, mobile phones or other devices
Neural processing unit (NPU), a class of specialized hardware accelerator or computer system designed to accelerate artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, including artificial neural networks and machine vision
Vision processing unit (VPU), an emerging (as of 2023) class of microprocessor; it is a specific type of AI accelerator, designed to accelerate machine vision tasks
Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), an AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google for neural network machine learning, using Google's own TensorFlow software.
Secure cryptoprocessor
Quantum processor, a computer that takes advantage of quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior, specifically quantum superposition and entanglement, using specialized hardware that supports the preparation and manipulation of quantum states.
Coprocessor
Floating-point unit
Audio processor
Network processor, a microprocessor specifically targeted at the networking application domain
Baseband processor
Multi-core processor, single component with two or more independent CPUs (called "cores") on the same chip carrier or on the same die
System on a chip, a chip including one or more processor cores, such as CPUs, GPUs and others, and additional support circuitry
Front-end processor, a helper processor for communication between a host computer and other devices


=== Software ===
Word processor, a computer application used for the production of potentially printable material
Document processor, a computer application that superficially resembles a word processor—but emphasizes the visual layout of the document's components


=== Systems ===
Data processing system, a combination of machines, people, and processes that for a set of inputs produces a defined set of outputs
Information system, a system composed of people and computers that processes or interprets information


== Other ==
Firewood processor, a machine designed to cut and split firewood
Food processor, an appliance used to facilitate repetitive tasks in the preparation of food
