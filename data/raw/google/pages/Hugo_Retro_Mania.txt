The game is a remake of the 1991 Commodore 64 game Skærmtrolden Hugo, which was itself based on the first season (1990) labyrinth scenario from the TV game show Hugo, but featuring all-new graphics and gameplay system. Unlike the original, the game features the evil witch Scylla (here renamed as "Sculla" and accompanied by her servant Don Croco from the Hugo Jungle Island series), complete with a version of the "Rope" end game from the 1990s Hugo games and TV show.
