Nik Software was a software development company established in 1995 as Nik Multimedia Inc. and based in San Diego, California. The company developed multiple image editing plug-ins and tools for digital image processing software applications. Nik Software was acquired by Google in 2012.


== History ==
Nik Multimedia was founded in 1995 by Nils Kokemohr in Hamburg. The firm focused on digital photography and graphic design. They initially developed Nils Efex! and Nils Type Efex! which were a combination of Photoshop extensions and textures. The firm was then acquired in 1998 by the TECHnik Group and re-launched to focus on the expansion of the digital imaging and photographic markets. In 1999 Michael J Slater joined as CEO of the company which subsequently grew into a respected software research and development company.
In February 2006 the company was renamed Nik Software and announced an investment and cooperation Agreement with Nikon Corporation, who in 2010 held a 35% stake in the company. In 2010, the company had 120 employees — around 40 of whom were located in San Diego where the company was headquartered while the remaining staff (primarily engineering) were based in Hamburg, Germany.
In September 2012, Nik Software was acquired by Google for an undisclosed amount.
