Arcade Archives is a series of emulated arcade games developed and published by Hamster Corporation. A sub-series called ACA Neo Geo focuses on re-releasing SNK's Neo Geo titles in their original MVS arcade format, unlike many services that attempt to emulate the console versions. Individual games are released in a weekly format.


== History ==
Hamster Corporation was formed in 1999 by alumni of the video game division of Toshiba EMI. The company previously released a similar series, Oretachi Gēsen Zoku, which was released only in Japan for the PlayStation 2, while acquiring the rights to the intellectual property of various defunct video game developers, such as Nichibutsu in March 2014, UPL in May 2016, NMK in June 2017, Video System in March 2018, Allumer in February 2023, and Athena in September 2023. Development is handled at Hamster's various offices, with emulators being developed by a group of Hudson Soft alumni at Sapporo, Hokkaido.
Despite forming a working relationship with Nintendo by providing games for their Virtual Console service, Nintendo surprised Hamster by agreeing to license their arcade games for the series, on the condition they remain exclusive to the Nintendo Switch. This included Sky Skipper, which was never released formally outside Japan save for a licensed Atari 2600 release by Parker Brothers; Hamster was granted permission to copy the ROM image of the game from the only surviving unmodified boardset archived at Nintendo of America.

Arcade Archives was first released for the PlayStation 4 on May 15, 2014 on the PlayStation Network; Nippon Ichi Software supported development of the series during its earliest years. The Nintendo Switch version was also launched on the Nintendo eShop on March 3, 2017, initially focusing on Neo Geo games before adding other arcade games, including titles from Nintendo. It supports various system-specific features, allowing players to share screenshots and videos and compete with others for online rankings.
The Xbox One version of the service, which only includes Neo Geo games, launched on February 23, 2017 on the Xbox Games Store. The Windows version of the service was launched on December 15, 2017, through the Microsoft Store and, like the Xbox One version, only includes Neo Geo games. ACA Neo Geo games were released on iOS (via the App Store) and Android (via Google Play) by SNK on November 30, 2021.

ACA 2 Neo Geo debuted on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S starting February 27, 2025, with The King of Fighters '98: The Slugfest being the debut title.
During the Nintendo Direct for the Nintendo Switch 2, Hamster announced Arcade Archives 2, with the debut title, Ridge Racer, released alongside the system on launch day. Hamster confirmed on subsequent days that Arcade Archives 2 would also be available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, also featuring Ridge Racer as a debut title; alongside a Nintendo Switch plus PlayStation 4 versions of the game confirmed as part of the original Arcade Archives.
