This is a list of Android distributions, Android-based operating systems (OS) commonly referred to as Custom ROMs or just ROMs, forked from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) without Google Play Services included officially in some or all markets, yet maintained independent coverage in notable Android-related sources. 
The list may include distributions that come pre-installed on a device (stock ROM) or modifications of them. Only builds considered official are listed.
