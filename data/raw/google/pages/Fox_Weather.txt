== History ==
On December 9, 2020, Fox News Media announced the forthcoming launch of an ad-supported weather service that would include local and national weather related news. On June 24, 2021, Fox News Media announced a slate of six meteorologists who would make up the team reporting for the channel, joining from other local TV stations.
The channel is overseen by Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott and executive Sharri Berg.
News of the launch sparked discussion on how the channel will cover climate change, an issue their sister channel Fox News has often dismissed. Regarding how the issue of climate change will be addressed on the new network, Berg stated in an interview that “...climate change is part of our lives. It’s how we live. It’s not going to be ignored.”
On August 18, 2021, Berg announced that Fox Weather would add three correspondents and five multimedia journalists to the team.
On September 1, 2021, Fox Weather released their first promo and announced that they would be launching in October. The launch date was later announced for October 25.

The network was also added as an over-the-air digital subchannel at the start of 2022 in markets served by the network's owned-and-operated stations group, presumably with local insertion allowing local forecasts and severe weather coverage. A weekend morning simulcast of the channel airs on Fox Business from 6 to 8 a.m. ET, which started on December 4.
YouTube TV added Fox Weather on February 2, 2022, becoming the first weather-focused channel to air on the OTT service.
