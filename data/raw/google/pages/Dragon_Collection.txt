Dragon Collection (ドラゴンコレクション, Doragon Korekushon) is a Japanese social network game created by Konami that was released on the GREE social networking platform in 2010. A manga adaptation titled Dragon Collection: Ryū o Suberu Mono was serialized from 2011 to 2012 in Kodansha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Magazine. It was collected in six tankōbon volumes. A trading card arcade game was released in 2013. An anime television series adaptation aired on April 7, 2014, alongside Monster Retsuden Oreca Battle, another Konami video game adaptation. The series ended on March 23, 2015, but a bonus episode showing events after Hiro leaves Dragon Earth aired on March 30.
This show, along with Oreca Battle, lacks an ending theme, a hallmark of anime that premiered on TV Asahi.
