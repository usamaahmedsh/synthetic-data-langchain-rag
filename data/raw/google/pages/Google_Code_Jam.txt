Google Code Jam was an international programming competition hosted and administered by Google. The competition began in 2003. The competition consists of a set of algorithmic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any programming language and development environment to obtain their solutions. From 2003 to 2007, Google Code Jam was deployed on Topcoder's platform. Since 2008 Google has developed their own dedicated infrastructure for the contest.
Between 2015 and 2018, Google also ran Distributed Code Jam, with the focus on distributed algorithms. This was run in parallel with the regular Code Jam, with its own qualification and final round, for a top prize of $10,000, but was only open for people who qualified to Round 2 of Code Jam (up to 3,000 people).
Several Google Code Jam problems have led to academic research.
On February 22, 2023, Google announced that Code Jam was to be discontinued alongside their other programming competitions, Hash Code and Kick Start. A series of four "farewell rounds" took place on April 15, 2023 from 14:00 until 18:00 UTC, with all rounds taking place at the same time. Login functionality for Google's programming competitions was disabled on June 1, 2023, followed by the shut down of the competitions' hosting platform exactly one month later, on July 1, 2023. A permanent archive of all Code Jam, Hash Code and Kick Start problems is available for download on GitHub.
