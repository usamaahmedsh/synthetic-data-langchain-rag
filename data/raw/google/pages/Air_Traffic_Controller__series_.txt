Air Traffic Controller (ぼくは航空管制官, Boku wa Kōkū Kanseikan; shortened as ATC) is a simulation computer game series,  developed by TechnoBrain, that simulates the operation of an airport. The games simulate the job of an air traffic controller. The player's mission is to direct planes onto the correct ILS, land them on the runway, taxi them to the correct gate, and to direct takeoffs.
Air Traffic Controller was released in Japan in September 1998. Its sequel Air Traffic Controller 2 was released in 2001. Air Traffic Controller 3 was released in 2008. Air Traffic Controller 4 was released in 2015.
Initially released as a computer game, there have also been five PlayStation Portable versions, a Game Boy Advance, a Nintendo DS version, nine Nintendo 3DS versions and five different mobile ports for both Android and iOS.


== Air Traffic Controller ==
The game features six airports. Players direct the air traffic for arrival and departures. There is only one channel of communication.

== Air Traffic Controller 2 ==
Air Traffic Controller 2 made many improvements. The game is now in 3D, more airport gates, and increased to five channels of communication: Approach, Tower, Ground, Delivery, and Departure. New features included ground movements (e.g. towing planes to gates), giving correct Standard Instrument Departure, use of radar vectors, and changing channel frequency. The choice of Standard Terminal Arrival Route distance eliminates the speed instruction in previous version.
In the game, there are a few conditions that will cause game over. These include head-on, near miss, pilots' pressure bar reaching 100%, or failed to accumulate enough points to pass that particular stage. The points are awarded according to how fast to reply a response. A slow or non-response will raise the pressure bar. Other things that increase pressure bar include instructing the plane to take off in tailwind or tower failing to give the plane permission to land or go-around. Additional points are awarded at the end of the stage, but before deciding whether there's enough points to pass, for minimal % in pressure bar. More bonus points are awarded if the pressure bar is at 0%.

== Air Traffic Controller 4 ==
Air Traffic Controller 4 is an air traffic control simulation game developed by TechnoBrain as a successor to the Air Traffic Controller 3. The game is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, until ROAH - Naha, which is no longer compatible with Windows 7 and 8. The first installment, RJTT - Haneda was originally planned to be released on July 15, 2015, but the developers delayed the release of the game to August 28, 2015. However, TechnoBrain delayed again to September 17, 2015, for testing the Windows 10 compatibility.
Since March 22, 2018, TechnoBrain released RJTT2 - Haneda 2, RJFF - Fukuoka, RJGG - Centrair, RJCC - New Chitose, ROAH - Naha, and RJSS - Sendai on Android and iOS.
Airports and airplanes are more realistically scaled. In-game time counter is now progressing as the same speed as real time. Furthermore, more gates are added for every airport to match their real-life counterparts compared to the previous games. There are also stages based on the actual schedule of the airports of which the players can select the time frame and channels they wish to take charge. Players can't choose runway for the plane to takeoff, landing nor even go-around unless the runway section (e.g. 16L, 16R. etc.) are opened due to changes to the wind pattern (only for RJTT - Haneda). Unlike the previous games, if the planes line up to follow another, the game will not result in a head-on collision game over (only in Normal Mode) unless they're heading into each other. Players can select planes at the top of it or at the flight control selection bar (bottom-right during gameplay). TechnoBrain Airlines also appears here like in ATC3, occasionally presenting problems for players to solve or work around (for the main stages of the game) as well as replacing airlines not included in game.
Similar to previous games, the game consists of two modes (Normal Mode and Game Mode). Game Mode is more challenging because player needs to pay attention to the planes on the ground to prevent head-on game over. However, these two modes were later omitted for future installments.
The game consists of 10 total installments and 4 expansion packs as of August 2022.


=== RJTT - Haneda ===
