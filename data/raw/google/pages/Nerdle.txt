Nerdle is a web-based number game created and developed by London-based data scientist Richard Mann together with his children and software developer Marcus Tettmar. Players have six attempts to guess an eight-digit/symbol calculation, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when the chosen numbers or math symbols match or occupy the correct position.  The game was inspired by the popular web-based Wordle and the founders' love of math. Nerdle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same calculation.


== Gameplay ==
