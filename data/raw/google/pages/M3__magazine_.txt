M3 is a Swedish technology news website, established in 2001 through the merger of two technology magazines, Maxidata and Mobile World. The publication was available in print until 2014, after which it transitioned to an online-only format.
M3 was influential in Sweden during the 2000s, when its tests, reviews, and investigations were frequently cited as sources in mainstream media such as Dagens Industri, Svenska Dagbladet, Expressen, Dagens Nyheter, Aftonbladet and others.
M3, together with tech publications "Computer Sweden", "PC för alla" and "MacWorld", were owned by International Data Group until 2025 when they were sold to private equity firm Regent LP.
