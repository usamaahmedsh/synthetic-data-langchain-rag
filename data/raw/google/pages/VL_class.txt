The VL class is a class of diesel locomotives built by Avteq at a factory in Sunshine, Melbourne for Railfirst Asset Management between 2007 and 2009. Built on the EMD GT26 platform, the class was an evolution of the Freight Australia XR class.
They have been hired to a variety of operators and have operated in all mainline states. Most entered service on lease to FreightLink hauling iron ore trains from Pine Creek to Darwin. As at 2010, some remained on hire to FreightLink while others were engaged in hauling grain trains in other states. All are named after Australian racehorses.
As at February 2022, nine of the 12 were being used by Qube. As at September 2023, five are operating on the broad gauge with the Numbers 351, 353, 356, 357 & 360. The other seven on standard gauge have the Numbers 352, 354, 355, 358, 359, 361 & 362 .
Avteq itself was founded in 2002 by Jed Macartney and Rob Powell as an aviation consulting business. In 2005, they diversified into locomotive manufacturing, building the VL class. They designed a second locomotive class, but none were ever manufactured. The company was deregistered in 2013. Southern Shorthaul Railroad would build two BRM class locomotives to the design in 2013.
