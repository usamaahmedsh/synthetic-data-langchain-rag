IndieGames.com wrote about the game: "I can't help but be completely and utterly impressed." 148Apps gave 4.5 of 5 stars and wrote: "This is a must-buy for anybody who loves sci-fi, mystery, or just adventure games in general." Gamezebo reviewer Jillian Werner wrote about the game: "[...] while its plot stumbles in the final act and its characters never fully get off the ground, the surrounding build-up and adventure is worth experiencing.  Greg may not be the greatest protagonist adventure gaming has ever known, but his world and its challenges are beautiful, engaging, and deserving of exploration." PocketMeta gave it a 4.8/5, saying that it was, "stylish, philosophical, and intelligent" and "how a Sci-fi adventure should be." RPGFan gave it a 72% saying, "Despite decent production values, Lost Echo is a bit of a lost cause." AppSpy gave it a 3/5 saying it was, "A handsome adventure game with an enticing air of mystery let down by poor pacing and bland dialogue." It received a Metacritic score of 71/100.
