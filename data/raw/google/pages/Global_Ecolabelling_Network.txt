The Global Ecolabelling Network (GEN) is a non-profit network composed of some 29 ecolabel organisations throughout the world representing nearly 60 countries and territories, with two associate members and a growing number of affiliate members, one of which is Google. GEN members have certified over 252,000 products and services for environmental leadership. GEN was established in 1994.
The stated goal of the Network is to further the exchange of information between national ecolabel organisations that operate "Type I" ecolabels, the strongest category, as defined by ISO 14024. "Blauer Engel" (Blue Angel), the German ecolabel, established in 1978, was the first of this kind. Ecolabels are "licensed" for use only after a product or service is proven to meet transparent, published standards for environmental preferability, verified by a qualified, independent third party, and assessed over multiple environmental parameters (not just one single issue). The ecolabels are an assurance to consumers and procurement professionals that a product or service is proven "green" and has high environmental values and integrity.
The Global Ecolabelling Network, its members, their licensees, and the public celebrates World Ecolabel Day every year in October.
