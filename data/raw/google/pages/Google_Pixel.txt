Google Pixel is a brand of portable consumer electronic devices that is developed by Google that runs the Pixel version of the Android operating system or the ChromeOS operating system. The primary line of Pixel products consists of Android-powered smartphones, produced since October 2016 as the replacement for the older Nexus line, with the current models being the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Pixel brand also includes laptop and tablet computers, as well as several accessories, and was originally introduced in February 2013 with the Chromebook Pixel.

=== Pixel and Pixel XL ===

Google announced the first generation Pixel smartphones, the Pixel, and the Pixel XL, on October 4, 2016, during the #MadeByGoogle event. Google emphasized the camera on the two phones, which ranked as the best smartphone camera on DxOMarkMobile with 90 points until HTC released the U11, which also scored 90 points. This is largely due to software optimizations such as HDR+. The Pixel phones also include unlimited cloud storage for pictures on Google Photos and, for devices purchased directly from Google, an unlockable bootloader. In 2019, a class action lawsuit over faulty microphones in some devices enabled Pixel owners to claim up to $500 in compensation.

=== Pixel UI (Pixel Launcher) ===

Google Pixel UI is an Android skin used for the Pixel phones and the Pixel Tablet, developed by Google. Starting from first generation of Google Pixel phones, Google had replaced the launcher for their smartphone with Pixel Launcher instead of Google Now Launcher which is the default launcher for Nexus series.
Unlike the Nexus phones, which Google shipped with "stock" Android (AOSP), the Pixel UI that came with the first generation Pixel phones were slightly modified compared to "stock" Android. Currently, Pixel UI and its home launcher are available on Pixel family devices only. (However, third-party modifications allow non-Pixel smartphones to install the Pixel Launcher with Google Now feed integration).
During the launch of Android 4.x "Ice Cream Sandwich", Google had started to replace some stock Android apps with Google apps, including the stock Android music apps with Google Play Music, and Android browser with Google Chrome. By the launch of Android 4.4.x "KitKat", most of the stock Android apps had been replaced with Google apps, such as the stock Android gallery being replaced with Google Photos, etc. This also includes the Android home launcher being replaced with the Google Now Launcher, allowing users to access to their Google Now feed more conveniently. However, the rest of the UI was still similar to stock Android, including the settings menu and toggles buttons colors.
Google officially launched the Pixel Launcher and Pixel UI together in the Pixel phones; unlike the Google Now Launcher which allowed non Nexus phones to install, the Pixel Launcher was only available on the Pixel phones. Most Android smartphones including Nexus phones are incompatible with the launcher. Some modifications Google had done to differentiate Pixel UI with stock Android included the setting toggle's buttons colors, and 24/7 online support which allowed the user to get direct support from Google's customer support.


=== Pixel Camera ===

The Pixel Camera is a camera software shipped with Pixel devices. The app features a basic camera interface along with several other features, such as Night Vision, Super Res Zoom, and Motion Photos. Initially released on April 16, 2014, as Google Camera, the application could be used on the Google Pixel phone until October 2023, when the software was renamed and delisted from Google Play. Multiple unofficial ports have been created to install features of the Pixel Camera on non-Google branded devices or older models of the phone.
