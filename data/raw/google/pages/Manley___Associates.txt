Manley & Associates was an independent software developer, founded in 1982, which developed or ported over 70 video games, multimedia, and educational entertainment titles which were published by other companies, including Electronic Arts, Activision, Disney, GameTek, Publishing International, and Spectrum HoloByte. Many of the company's early games were one or two person projects created in founder Ivan Manley's house, but eventually it grew to roughly 60 people working from an office park in Issaquah, Washington.
In the mid-1990s, Manley & Associates ported some games for Electronic Arts and was subsequently acquired by EA in 1996. Explaining the decision to sell the company to EA, Ivan Manley said that in order to invest in newer technologies, Manley & Associates had to either become a publisher or merge with an established publisher. The studio was relocated to neighboring Bellevue, Washington and renamed Electronic Arts Seattle. EA Seattle closed in 2002 and EA moved half the people to EA Vancouver, the rest were fired.
