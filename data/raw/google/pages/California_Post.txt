The California Post is an upcoming American conservative daily tabloid newspaper to be published in Los Angeles, California. The Post will serve as the California counterpart to the New York Post, and will be owned by News Corp. The California Post plans to begin publishing in early 2026, with Australian journalist Nick Papps serving as editor-in-chief. Papps served prior as the weekend editor of News Corp Australia's Melbourne publication, the Herald Sun.
Keith Poole, editor-in-chief at the New York Post, will be in charge of both papers. News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson said that "the [California] Post will play a crucial role in engaging and enlightening readers, who are starved of serious reporting and puckish wit."
