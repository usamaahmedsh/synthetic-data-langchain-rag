Carlos Drummond de Andrade (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈkaʁluz dɾuˈmõ dʒi ɐ̃ˈdɾadʒi]) (October 31, 1902 – August 17, 1987) was a Brazilian poet and writer, considered by some as the greatest Brazilian poet of all time.
He has become something of a national cultural symbol in Brazil, where his widely influential poem "Canção Amiga" ("Friendly Song") has been featured on the 50-cruzado novo bill.


== Biography ==
Drummond was born in Itabira, a mining village in Minas Gerais in the southeastern region of Brazil. His parents were farmers belonging to old Brazilian families of mainly Portuguese origin. He went to a school of pharmacy in Belo Horizonte, but never worked as a pharmacist after graduation. He worked as a civil servant for most of his life, eventually becoming director of the history for the National Historical and Artistic Heritage Service of Brazil.
Drummond drifted towards communism at the start of World War II and took up the editorship of the Brazilian Communist Party's official newspaper, Tribuna Popular, but later abandoned the post due to disagreements over censorship, which Drummond staunchly opposed.

  
Drummond's work has been translated by American poets including Mark Strand and Lloyd Schwartz. Later writers and critics have sometimes credited his relationship with Elizabeth Bishop, his first English language translator, as influential for his American reception, but though she admired him, Bishop claimed she barely even knew him. In an interview with George Starbuck in 1977, she said, "I didn't know him at all. He's supposed to be very shy. I'm supposed to be very shy. We've met once — on the sidewalk at night. We had just come out of the same restaurant, and he kissed my hand politely when we were introduced."


== Style ==

Drummond adopted the new forms of Brazilian modernism that were evolving in the 1920s, inspired by the work of Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade, making use of free verse, and not depending on a fixed meter.
Drummond was the first poet to assert himself after the premiere modernist of Brazil and created a unique style dominated by his writing. In 1994, Alfredo Bosi said that "The work of Drummond reaches – as Fernando Pessoa, Jorge de Lima, Murilo Mendes, and Herberto Helder – a coefficient of loneliness that detached from the soil of history, leading the reader to an attitude-free of references, trademarks or ideological or prospective". 
In the late 1980s, his poetry began to become more erotic. O Amor Natural (Natural Love), a collection of erotic poems, was published posthumously. The book inspired the 1996 Dutch documentary film O Amor Natural.
