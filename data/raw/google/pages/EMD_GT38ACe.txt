The EMD GT38ACe/GT38AC (known as CC205 in Indonesia) diesel–electric locomotives are made by Electro-Motive Diesel for export in Indonesia. There are 91 locomotives owned by the state-owned Indonesian Railway Company (PT Kereta Api Indonesia), all of them are for in Sumatra and replace the aging EMD G26. It's also one of two most advanced-technology locomotive in Indonesia (another one is GE CM20EMP).


== History ==
PT Kereta Api Indonesia has operated some EMD G26 (G26MC-2U, or known in Indonesia as CC 202) since 1986 and some of them began to break down due to their ages and severe works. In 2011, PT Kereta Api Indonesia began to look for the replacements of G26MC-2U; more powerful and advanced locomotives than G26MC-2Us. After several auction processes, EMD won the contract to build more powerful locomotives with AC traction technology for PT. KAI.


== Numbering ==

Older locomotives were numbered as CC 205 01 to CC 205 55 (including the bonus unit). However, due to the most recent regulation of the Ministry of Transportation, then the numbering system is changed according to its arrival year. The newer locomotives used new numbering system from the Ministry of Transportation (CC 205 21 01 - CC 205 21 36).

The first arrival (2011)
In this year, the first six locomotives arrived. Their numberings were CC 205 01 to CC 205 06. However, to comply with the most recent regulation, the numberings were changed into CC 205 11 01 to CC 205 11 06

The second arrival (2013)
There were 44 locomotives arriving in this year. Their numberings were CC 205 07 to CC 205 50. However, to comply with the most recent regulation, the numbering were changed into CC 205 13 01 to CC 205 13 44.

The bonus units (2014)
The five bonus units arrived in 2014. These units were numbered as CC 205 51 to CC 205 55. However, to comply with the most recent regulation, the numberings were changed into CC 205 14 01 to CC 205 14 05.

The third arrival (2021)
There were 36 locomotives arrived in 2021. Their numberings were CC 205 21 01 to CC 205 21 36.


== Performance ==
The CC205s can haul up more than 48 (forty-eight) coal hoppers in single-traction mode, and 80 coal hoppers in double-traction mode. Thanks to the AC Traction technology, the locomotives can generate output more than 2,200 HP (bigger than its predecessor, CC202) and starting tractive effort of as much as 450 kN. But, even with such a big power like that, stations in South Sumatra and Lampung cannot accommodate more than 60 coal gondolas, due to the yard-length limit in many station in South Sumatra and Lampung.
In their early years, one CC205 was able to replace two CC204s or CC202s on hauling 35 (thirty-five) to 45 (forty-five) coal hoppers. Because of the very small numbers of CC205 between 2011 and 2013, they was only used as "solo leaders" (a train with just 1 locomotive leading). Only in 2013, two CC205s are coupled together with Multiple Unit Control. After 2013, two CC205s normally hauls between 50 and 60 coal hoppers.
In their daily operations, two CC205s are coupled together using Multiple Unit for easier haul, especially on steep grades. Unlike other locomotives in Indonesia, CC205 has met EPA Tier 2 emission regulation and is more efficient up to 25% - thanks to the latest generation of EMD 710G3 engine that employs an electronic fuel injection system and several tweaks on the exhaust system. The maximum speed of this locomotive is 50 mph (80 km/h), but it operates normally at 19 - 37 mph (30 – 60 km/h) due to the total gross weight of the entire cars coupled to CC205s. With the same amount of payload tonnage, two units of CC205s can replace three units of CC202s for hauling 60 coal hoppers, with one hopper has 50 tons maximum payload.
In the flat section of Kertapati - Prabumulih line, single CC205 has been tested to pull 58 flatcars with modified container. When the 2025 and 2026 batch of CC205 will arrive in Indonesia, some of them will be based on Kertapati Depot (Palembang) to haul private coal trains.


== Builders ==
All of the first batch locomotives were built at EMD Plant in London, Ontario. Later batches came from EMD Plant at Muncie, Indiana.


== Features ==
All of the CC205s have a distinctive Perumka/PT Kereta Api's 1990s-style red-and-blue livery, similar to the CC201s and CC202s allocated at South Sumatran railway. Inside the cab, old school side controller has been replaced with more modern cab with EM2000 computer system and digital display. CC205s also equipped with an automatic engine start/stop (AESS) system, which is the first type of locomotives in Indonesia using AESS, and makes CC205 be the most efficient locomotive in fuel usage. They are even equipped with  Nathan AirChime KS-1 single tone horns, similar to the older CC202 (EMD G26MC-2U) locomotives.


== Bonus units and reorder for PT. Kereta Api Indonesia ==
In 2014, PT. KAI received 5 (five) more EMD GT38ACe from Progress Rail - EMD as bonus units. These bonus units were given free by Progress Rail - EMD as their compensation of responsibility due to the lateness of delivery (off-schedule) of 44 (forty-four) EMD GT38ACe ordered by PT. KAI to Indonesia in 2013. As a result, PT. KAI has 55 units GT38ACe's; 50 were purchased and 5 were bonus. All 55 (fifty-five) units of GT38ACe's owned by PT. KAI are in service, hauling coal trains in Sumatra.
On April 16, 2020, PT Kereta Api Indonesia (PT KAI) has signed a contract for 36 new GT38ACe freight locomotives, expanding the public railway operator's existing GT Series fleet. 36 new locomotives will go into service for PT KAI's South Sumatra coal haulage operations and join more than 50 other GT38ACe locomotives already operating in this service since 2011. Delivery of the locomotives expected in late 2021, and arrived in Panjang Harbour, Lampung, Indonesia on June 19, 2021, June 26, 2021, and September 22–24, 2021.
On February 15, 2024, PT KAI has signed a contract with Progress Rail for 54 additional GT38ACe locomotives. They are expected to be delivered in stages from April 2025 to April 2026.


== Other operator ==
In February 2015, Congo-Ocean Railway taking delivery of 10 GT38AC locomotives that have similar specifications to PT KAI locomotives except for some small technical differences, particularly in their fuel management system (Note: the type of the Indonesian locomotives is GT38ACe, while the ones for Congo is GT38AC).
