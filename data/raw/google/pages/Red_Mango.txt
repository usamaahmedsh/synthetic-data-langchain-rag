== Background ==
Daniel J. Kim, the company's founder, graduated from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business in 1998, and first worked as an investment banker with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. 
According to the company website, Red Mango gets its name because "the mango, distinctly delicious and high in nutrition, becomes red at its optimal stage of ripeness."
