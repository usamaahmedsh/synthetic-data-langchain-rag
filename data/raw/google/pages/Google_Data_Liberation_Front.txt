The Google Data Liberation Front is an engineering team at Google whose "goal is to make it easier for users to move their data in and out of Google products." The team, which consults with other engineering teams within Google on how to "liberate" Google products, currently supports 57 products. The purpose of the Data Liberation Front is to ensure that data can be migrated from Google once an individual or company stops using their services or the service is discontinued by Google.
