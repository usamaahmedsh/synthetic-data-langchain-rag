== Gameplay ==


=== GREE game ===
The game was a free-to-play idol raising simulator in which the player, as the producer, trained idols and sent them to work in various locations while also making the idols 765 Production Theater bigger. The idols were obtained through collecting cards ranked by rarity and divided into three categories, Vocal, Dance, and Visual, with a fourth category, Ex, reserved for special cards. Leveling up the cards made the idols stronger, with the higher rarities being able to reach higher levels.
The feature phone version was discontinued on February 2, 2016; a desktop client was released within the same month.
The GREE game was shut down on March 19, 2018.
