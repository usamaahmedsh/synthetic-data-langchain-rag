Novelis Inc. is an American industrial aluminum smelting company, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It produces rolled aluminum and is an aluminum recycler, supplying to sectors including beverage cans, automotive, aerospace, consumer electronics, construction, foil and packaging.
Novelis has been an independent subsidiary of the multinational aluminum and copper manufacturing company Hindalco Industries since 2007.


== Company history ==
The company was incorporated in 2004 after being spun off from Alcan, a now defunct Canadian mining and aluminum manufacturer. In 2007 the company was acquired by Hindalco Industries for $6 billion, itself a subsidiary of the Aditya Birla Group.
In May 2024, Novelis filed its registration statement for a proposed IPO, but it withdrew its plans in October of the same year. In March 2025, Novelis announced closure of its operation in Fairmont, West Virginia, at a 100-year old production plant, the latest in a series of closures. 


== Operations ==
Novelis is the world's largest producer of rolled aluminum sheet with operations in 11 countries. The company divides its operations into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The regional headquarters are Atlanta, Zurich, Seoul and São Paulo. Novelis also has operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, China, Malaysia and Vietnam.
The company invested $100 million in its first manufacturing facility in China, which opened in 2014. In response to global demand for aluminum sheet for automotive, electronics and beverage cans, the company has announced capital investments including a $400 million expansion in Asia, a $300 million expansion in Brazil and $200 million expansion in North America. In July 2014, it announced that Reynolds Consumer Products Inc., a subsidiary of the Rank Group of New Zealand, purchased the North American consumer products division of Novelis, for CAD $33.75mn.
Novelis recycles more than 70 billion used beverage cans each year.
In May 2022, Novelis announced plans to invest $2.5 billion in a new, low-carbon, aluminum plant in Bay Minette, Alabama. Once complete, it will be the first fully integrated aluminium mill built for 40 years.
On September 16th, 2025 the Oswego, NY facility suffered a fire in the "hot mill" section. The three-alarm fire brought down part of the factory’s roof, requiring 26 area fire departments to extinguish, according to the Oswego County fire coordinators office.
