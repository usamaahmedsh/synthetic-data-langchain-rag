Google Nexus is a discontinued line of consumer electronic mobile devices that ran a stock version of the Android operating system. Google managed the design, development, marketing, and support of these devices, but some development and all manufacturing were carried out by partnering with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 
Alongside the main smartphone products, the line also included tablet computers (example: Nexus 7) and streaming media players (example: Nexus Q); the Nexus started out in January 2010 and reached its end in October 2016, replaced by Google Pixel family. 
Devices in the Nexus line were considered Google's core Android products. They contained little to no manufacturer or wireless carrier modifications to Android (such as custom user interfaces), although devices sold through carriers may be SIM locked, had some extra branding, and may have received software updates at a slower pace than the unlocked variant. Save for some carrier-specific variants, Nexus devices were often among the first Android devices to receive updates to the operating system. All Nexus devices featured an unlockable bootloader to allow further development and end-user modification. Although Nexus devices were originally produced in small quantities as they were intended as developer phones, the lack of bloatware/modifications to Android while providing similar performance to more expensive flagship smartphones from OEMs gained Nexus devices a considerable following. In addition to the Nexus program, Google also sold Google Play editions of OEM devices, which run the "stock" version of Android without the OEM nor carrier modifications.
OEMs that were part of the Nexus program were namely HTC, Samsung, LG, Motorola, Huawei and Asus. In late 2016, the Nexus lineup was replaced by the Google Pixel, which provides a similar stock Android experience but sold for considerably higher prices, directly competing with flagship smartphones from OEMs. Google stated that they "don't want to close a door completely, but there is no plan right now to do more Nexus devices." In 2017, Google partnered with HMD Global in making new Nokia phones, as part of the Android One program, which has been considered by some as a spiritual successor to the Nexus.

== Philip K. Dick estate claim ==
Upon the announcement of the first Nexus device, the Nexus One, the estate of science fiction author Philip K. Dick claimed that the Nexus One name capitalized on intellectual property from Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and that the choice of name was a direct reference to the Nexus-6 series of androids in the novel.
