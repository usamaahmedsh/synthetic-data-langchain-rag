A statue of singer Kate Smith (1907–1986) by Marc Mellon was installed outside Philadelphia's Stateside Live!, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, until 2019.


== Description and history ==
The 8-foot (2.4 m) bronze sculpture was commissioned by the Philadelphia Flyers and unveiled on October 8, 1987. It was placed into storage in 2010 because of the demolition of the Spectrum arena.
On April 21, 2019, the statue was removed due to the controversy of some her renditions of songs such as "That's Why Darkies Were Born" and "Pickaninny Heaven". Her family responded by denying the allegations and argued that Paul Robeson popularized some of those songs.
