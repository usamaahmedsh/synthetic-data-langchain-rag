All following Nintendo-owned licensed games were created as part of various Nintendo Game Seminars held from 2005 to 2010. These seminars were designed to teach students how to develop games by having them work in groups to create their own titles. Nintendo published these games through DS Download Stations in Japan. Games from seminars held before 2005 were never released, while those from after 2010 were made available on the Wii U eShop. Additionally, the 2009 and 2010 games were also downloadable via the Wii's Minna no Nintendo Channel and Nintendo Zones, alongside DS Download Stations.
