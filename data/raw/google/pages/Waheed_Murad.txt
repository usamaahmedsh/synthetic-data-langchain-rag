== Early life ==
Murad was an only child who was born in Sialkot and grew up in Karachi. His mother was Shireen Murad (a Christian from Bikaner who had converted to Islam), and his father was Nisar Murad, a film distributor in Bombay, both of whom had migrated to Karachi before the partition of India (1947). He did graduation from S. M. Arts College, Karachi, and then masters in English literature from University of Karachi. His father's family belonged to the cultural elite of Sialkot.
Murad's ancestors had migrated from the Bahmani Sultanate in southern India to Kashmir and eventually settled in Sialkot in the 18th-century. Where Murad's grandfather Zahoor Murad, an advocate and a social activist, adopted the surname "Murad" in 1887. The Murads also claimed Turkish ancestry; claiming that one of their ancestors, Murat, was a soldier of Ottoman-origin serving in the Mughal Army who settled in Punjab.


== Film career ==
Waheed Murad started his film career by playing a cameo in 1959 in Al-Hamid's Saathi. He then his father's established 'Film Art' in 1961 as a producer of the film Insan Badalta Hai. His second film as producer, Jab Se Dakha Hai Tumhein starring Darpan and Zeba, was commercially unsuccessful. Afterwards, Darpan most of the time started coming late at studio. Zeba suggested Waheed to cast himself as hero in his next film. Waheed was not ready to sign himself in his own movies. But when the same suggestion came from his old good friend Pervaiz Malik, he accepted it on the condition that if Zeba would be his co-star, Zeba accepted in return (according to Zeba). As a result, he debuted in a starring role in 1962's Aulad, where he played a support role. The film was directed by S.M. Yousuf. Murad's rise to fame came with Heera Aur Pathar, released in 1964. This film marked a significant milestone in his career as both a producer and actor. Notably, his childhood friend Pervez Malik made his directorial debut with this movie. He got the Nigar award in the Best Actor category for the same film.
In 1966, Murad produced and acted in Armaan, whose story was also written by him and directed by Pervaiz Malik. Nasir, the carefree son of a tycoon who switches place with his friend on their tour to Muree. Surpassing all the former box office records at that time by completing 75 weeks in the theaters, Armaan became the first film to celebrate its platinum jubilee at the box office. The film achieved cult status due to its music, composed by Sohail Rana, especially the song "Ko Ko Korina", the first popsong of South Asia. For the film, Murad received two Nigar awards in the categories of best producer and best actor.
Following the success of Armaan, Murad reunited the team for his next production Ehsaan, released in 1967, which was directed by Pervaiz Malik, and featured music by Sohail Rana. In the film, Murad played a psychiatrist who falls for a widow played by Zeba.
In 1967, he appeared as the leading actor in films like Devar Bhabi, Doraha, Insaaniyat and Maan baap.

The combination of Waheed Murad, Pervaiz Malik, Masroor Anwar, Sohail Rana, Ahmed Rushdi and Zeba created a number of films. Waheed Murad brought Malik, Anwar and Rana under the umbrella of 'Film Arts'. Film Arts broke up and Pervaiz Malik started creating his own projects with new actors. A total of seven films, including two films, i.e., Usey dekha usey chaha and Dushman released after a long gap of 6 years in 1974, were produced with the combination of Waheed and Pervaiz (but not under 'Film Art' Production).
In 1968, Murad started in his production Samandar, co-starring Shabnam. Set in a fishing colony, Samandar explores themes of power struggles, foreign intrusion, and the complexities of relationships between different groups, marking a significant departure from Murad's earlier films. Murad made his debut as a singer in the film by singing  "Saathi Tera Mera Saathi Hai" with Masood Rana. The film was a mediocre success at the box office.
In 1969, Murad made his directorial debut with Ishaara, for which he wrote the story and also produced. In the film, Murad played the role of a struggling artist, and sang the song "Jaise Taise Beet Gaya Din" with Deeba. The film also starring Rozina, Aliya and Talish, was commercially unsuccessful. Murad received another Nigar award in the best actor category for the film.

=== Film Art productions ===
Waheed Murad produced eleven films under his father's company Film Art. He was the youngest film producer in the Pakistani film industry at that time. Most of his produced films were either Golden Jubilee or Silver Jubilee. During the 1960s and early 1970s, he produced films like Insaan Badalta Hai (1961) (his first film as producer), Armaan (1966), Ehsaan (1967), Naseeb Apna Apna (1970) and Mastana Mahi (Punjabi film of 1971). However, after Mastana Mahi, he produced no film except Hero which was produced in the 1980s and was released after his death.
As a director, he had directed as well as produced Ishaara (1969) with co-star Deeba.


== Playback singers ==

In Waheed's career, most of the songs picturised by him were sung by Ahmed Rushdi. He sang more than 200 duet and solo songs for him. Other playback singers who provided voice for him were Mehdi Hassan, Masood Rana, Saleem Raza, Akhlaq Ahmed, Mujeeb Aalam, Asad Amanat Ali Khan, Bashir Ahmad, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan and A Nayyar.
In August 2018, Coke Studio produced a remake of Ahmed Rushdi's first South Asian pop song "Ko Ko Korina", originally lip-sync by Waheed Murad in the 1966 film Armaan, in the voices of Mustehsan and Ahad Raza Mir. Their rendition of this Pakistani classic was widely criticized. Within a few days of the video being released on YouTube, it became the most-disliked video in the music show's 11-year history. Waheed Murad's son Adil Murad also reacted to the outcry by apologizing to the song's fans for the controversial remake. In 2022, "Ko Ko Korina", featured in the opening scene of American series Ms. Marvel and won top ratings.


== Later life ==
By the late 1970s, Waheed was being cast in supporting roles either with Nadeem or with Mohammad Ali. Most of the leading heroines like Zeba, Shabnam and Nisho were not allowed to play lead roles with Waheed by their husbands. Pervaiz Malik wrote in a local newspaper: "Not even once during that time [did] Waheed come to me seeking work in my films.  Waheed was becoming depressed. His close friends revealed that he was becoming addicted to alcohol, oral tobacco and sleeping pills. Even his domestic life suffered and his wife Salma left for the United States. A combination of bad habits and stress caused ulceration in Waheed's stomach in 1981. He suffered from bleeding and had to undergo stomach removal to save his life. His many fans came to the hospital to donate blood to save his life. Although, he recovered, he lost a significant amount of weight. Even then, Iqbal Akhtar and Iqbal Yousuf, who proved to be real friends in difficult times, cast Waheed Murad in their movies. Waheed appeared old and charmless in Dil ney phir yaad keya and Ghairao. Even his loyal admirers felt that it was all over for him."
In 1983, Anwar Maqsood, a TV writer and anchor and a close friend, invited Waheed to his TV comedy show Silver Jubilee.
Babra Sharif, revealed that during the filming of a scene of Hero, Waheed lost his balance while walking toward her and fell down. He took several minutes to catch his breath prior to standing up on his feet again.
In July 1983, Waheed was driving his car too fast and struck a tree. He was left with a scar on his face. A few days after the accident, Waheed asked his friend Pervez Malik for a role. Malik said, "Get better and you will be the lead in my next film." He replied, "You give me the role and I will get better". He was going to Karachi to get the scar fixed to complete the last few scenes of Hero when he met the chief editor, Ilyas Rasheedi, of the film magazine 'Nigar' at the airport. Rasheedi wrote in his magazine:

By chance a famous film producer was also present in the waiting area and Waheed put him on the spot by asking if he had a role for him for Javed Sheikh's father in his movie. The producer had a difficult time dodging Waheed.


=== Last days and death ===
Waheed's son Aadil was in Karachi staying with his grandmother. A day before his face surgery, Waheed celebrated his son's birthday. He bought several gifts for Aadil and wished him a happy year.

He returned late to spend the night at Anita Ayub's mother Mumtaz Ayub's home. When Waheed did not wake up until late, the door had to be forced open and Waheed was found lying on the floor, dead for several hours. A paan leaf with an unidentified substance in it was found in his mouth. It is not clear if the cause of death was a heart attack or suicide. Waheed was buried near his father's grave in Firdous Market Cemetery Lahore.
