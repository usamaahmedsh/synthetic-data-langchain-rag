This is a list of games that were available for purchase on the Stadia cloud gaming service from Google, which has now been discontinued.
At the time of the service's shuttering in January 2023, there were 280 titles on this list. Of these, five were Stadia exclusives during the lifespan of the platform as of the date the shutdown was announced. Additionally, Worm Game, a game originally made for internal testing of the service, was released five days before the service shut down as the platform's only first-party title. The exclusives are marked in yellow   and with (§). Some of the exclusive titles have since been released elsewhere, although Outcasters was already in maintenance mode at the time of the service shutdown and its publisher stated that it would not be re-released.
