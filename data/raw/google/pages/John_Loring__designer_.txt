John Loring (born November 23, 1939) is design director emeritus of Tiffany & Co., where he was design director from 1979 to 2009. He is the author of numerous books about Tiffany's and art in general and a longtime contributor to Architectural Digest.


== Biography ==
Prior to joining Tiffany in 1979 as design director, Loring was the New York bureau chief of Architectural Digest, as well as being one of the magazine's principal editorial contributors. He was also a professor of art at the graduate school of the University of California.
He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature from Yale University in 1960. After graduating, he continued his studies for four more years at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Since 1964, his prints and paintings have been exhibited in Europe and the United States.
Loring continues to write on art and design. He serves on the Acquisitions Committee of The Museum of Modern Art's Department of Prints and Illustrated Books. He is also a serious collector of 20th-century furniture and ceramics. His interests in cooking and interior design have been recognized in major publications, including The New York Times Magazine, Bon Appetit, Food and Wine, Architectural Digest, House & Garden, L’Oeil, Arbitare, GQ, House Beautiful, Metropolitan Home, Gala, The New Yorker and French Vogue.  He was honored with the feature profile in The New Yorker (August 10, 1992).
In a foreword to Loring's 2011 photography book Christian Lost or Found, photojournalist Harry Benson praises his friend: "With every project he tackles, John Loring's instinctive brilliance produces a little magic, and he has one of the best eyes for photography in the world. You cannot but linger over his photographs – You find there a haunting elegance that stays with you."
