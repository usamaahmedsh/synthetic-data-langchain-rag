Diane Marie Lambert is an American statistician known for her work on zero-inflated models, a method for extending Poisson regression to applications such as the statistics of manufacturing defects in which one can expect to observe a large number of zeros.
A former Bell Labs Fellow, she is a research scientist for Google, where she lists her current research areas as "algorithms and theory, data mining and modeling, and economics and electronic commerce".


== Education and career ==
Lambert earned her Ph.D. in 1978 from the University of Rochester. Her dissertation, supervised by W. Jackson Hall, was P-Values: Asymptotics and Robustness.
In the early part of her career, she worked as a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University. As an assistant professor there, she did pioneering work on the confidentiality of statistical information.
