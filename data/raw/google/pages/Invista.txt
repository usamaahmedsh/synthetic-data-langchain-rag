In 2008, Invista sued Rhodia, a chemical company, for theft and misappropriation of a chemical process technology used to produce nylon 6,6.
In February 2009, INVISTA announced a refinancing and capitalization plan that had reduced its debt by $1.6 billion since the previous June. In the same year, Invista was the launch sponsor for WWDChina Week in Review, a weekly fashion publication.
Also in 2009, INVISTA agreed to pay a $1.7 million civil penalty and spend up to $500 million to correct self-reported environmental violations at its facilities in seven states. Prior to the settlement, the company had disclosed to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) more than 680 violations after auditing 12 facilities acquired from DuPont in 2004. In June 2012, DuPont & INVISTA agreed to an out of court settlement to resolve indemnification issues related to these environmental issues.
In 2019, Invista sold its Apparels & Advanced Textiles business to Shandong Ruyi. The sale included brands Lycra, Coolmax, and Thermolite. It was said to have cost more than $2 billion. Koch Industries still retains a minority stake in The Lycra Company.
