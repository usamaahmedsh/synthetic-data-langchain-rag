== History ==
When Netflix began producing original animated content in 2013, all projects were created by external studios, most notably DreamWorks Animation Television. This arrangement continued for several years. In November 2018, Netflix announced that it had begun developing original animated works in-house, including Klaus and Kid Cosmic. In 2019, Netflix Animation expanded its operations by leasing dedicated production spaces in Burbank and Hollywood to support its growing slate of animated series and films.
The division grew further in July 2022 with Netflix's acquisition of the Australian animation and visual-effects studio Animal Logic. Following the acquisition, Animal Logic's operations were integrated into Netflix Animation in January 2024 as part of a broader consolidation of the company's in-house animation production to create Netflix Animation Studios. That same month, Melissa Cobb stepped down as vice president of film animation and moved into a producer role, with Karen Toliver appointed as her successor. In June 2024, Hannah Minghella was named head of feature animation and live-action family film at Netflix, succeeding Toliver.
