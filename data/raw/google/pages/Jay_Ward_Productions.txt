Jay Ward Productions, Inc. (sometimes shortened to Ward Productions) is an American animation studio based in Costa Mesa, California. It was founded in 1948 by American animator Jay Ward. As of 2022, the studio is headed by Ward's daughter, Tiffany Ward, and granddaughter, vice president Amber Ward.
Before 2022, when the studio signed a distribution deal with WildBrain, the Jay Ward catalogue was managed by Bullwinkle Studios, a joint venture between Jay Ward Productions and the DreamWorks Animation subsidiary of NBCUniversal.


== History ==
The company was based on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, across Sunset Boulevard from the Chateau Marmont.


=== Jay Ward Productions today ===
By 2002, Jay Ward Productions had formed Bullwinkle Studios LLC, a joint venture with Classic Media (then an Entertainment Rights subsidiary), to manage the Jay Ward characters. Bullwinkle Studios's first production was George of the Jungle with Studio B Productions, a unit of DHX Media. The series was broadcast on Teletoon, then added to Cartoon Network. Jay Ward's daughter, Tiffany Ward, is the president of Ward Productions and Bullwinkle Studios. Classic Media was acquired in 2012 by DreamWorks Animation, which was later purchased by the Comcast-owned NBCUniversal in 2016.
On February 3, 2022, Jay Ward Productions signed a deal with WildBrain to produce new content based on its portfolio. The agreement also includes distribution rights to the entire Jay Ward Productions library. However, DreamWorks retains the distribution rights to its co-productions.
