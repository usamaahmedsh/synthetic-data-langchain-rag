== History ==
Stackdriver the company was created in 2012 by founders Dan Belcher and Izzy Azeri. The company's goal was to provide consistent monitoring across cloud computing's multiple service layers, using a single SaaS solution.

In May 2014, the Stackdriver company was acquired by Google. An expanded version of the product (adding support for logs analysis, hybrid cloud support, and deep integration with Google Cloud) was rebranded as Google Stackdriver and was launched to general availability in October, 2016.
