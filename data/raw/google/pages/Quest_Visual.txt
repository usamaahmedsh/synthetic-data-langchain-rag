Quest Visual's first product, Word Lens 1.0, was released on December 16, 2010, and was available in 2015 as Word Lens 2.2.3 for Apple's iPhone, iPod, and iPad through iTunes, as well as for a selection of Android smartphones through Google Play. It was unavailable as of 2021. At Google's unveiling of its Glass Development Kit in November 2013, the translation capabilities of Word Lens were also demonstrated on Google Glass. According to a January 2014 New York Times article, Word Lens is currently free for Google Glass. Google also made all Word Lens language packs freely available for a "limited time". Word Lens capabilities were incorporated into the Google Translate app and released on January 14, 2015. The company did not have any other products by the time of acquisition.
