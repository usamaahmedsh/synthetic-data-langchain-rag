This is a list of notable test automation frameworks commonly used for unit testing. Such frameworks are not limited to unit-level testing; can be used for integration and system level testing.
Frameworks are grouped below. For unit testing, a framework must be the same language as the source code under test, and therefore, grouping frameworks by language is valuable. But some groupings transcend language. For example, .NET groups frameworks that work for any language supported for .NET, and HTTP groups frameworks that test an HTTP server regardless of the implementation language on the server.


== Columns ==
The columns in the tables below are described here.

Name: Name of the framework
xUnit: Whether classified as xUnit
TAP: Whether can emit Test Anything Protocol (TAP) output
Generators: Whether supports data generators – generating test input data and running a test with the generated data
Fixtures: Whether supports test local fixtures – associating a test environment with a single test
Group fixtures: Whether supports group fixtures – associating a test environment with a group of tests
Some columns do not apply to some groupings and are therefore omitted from that groupings table.
