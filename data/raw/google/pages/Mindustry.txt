== Gameplay ==

Mindustry is a top-down two-dimensional grid-based game, in which players assume the role of a small construction ship deployed from a central structure (the "core"). The basic elements of gameplay are resource extraction, transportation and organization, manufacturing of advanced materials and processing facilities, construction and maintenance of defensive and offensive structures, production of fighting units, and research of superior technologies.
The central goal of gameplay is for the player to avoid having all of their core(s) destroyed, all structures are rebuildable upon destruction (with cores needing to be built atop dedicated "Core zone" equal to or greater than the size of the core that is built), with the destruction of all active core(s) results in immediate loss. On "survival" maps, enemies are dispatched in waves of progressively stronger units that must be destroyed before they reach and destroy all active core(s), making it similar to a tower defense game; enemy pathfinding automatically seeks out poorly-defended areas or openings to break through. Contrariwise, "attack" maps have (in addition to waves of units) enemy structures and core(s) which must be destroyed to win.
The game contains two planets, Serpulo and Erekir, which have different materials, structures, units and gameplay. Serpulo has 16 materials, 131 buildable blocks, 18 gun turrets, and 35 manufacturable units (five units are in each tree; there are three trees for ground, two for air and two for naval). Erekir has 10 materials, 98 blocks, 10 turrets, and 15 units (two ground trees and one air). On Serpulo, "logic blocks" provide an assembly-like language for controlling units and buildings. On both planets, it is possible to save and reuse "schematics", blueprints consisting of arbitrary blocks in specific arrangements.
The primary single-player game mode is the campaign, in which players are tasked with conquering a planet by way of capturing a sequence of regions (some by surviving enemy waves, some by attacking enemy bases). After a region is captured, it can be used to build more production capabilities and export materials to other regions. Apart from the campaign, there is an editor and sandbox mode, and custom maps are made by players.
On multiplayer servers, there are cooperative maps (in which all players share a team and attempt to defeat computer-controlled enemies), as well as team and free-for-all PvP.


== Release and reception ==
Mindustry was created in April 2017, for the itch.io "Metal Monstrosity" game jam, where it was ranked first among 15 entries. Its first public release (v1) was in 2017, and the first Steam release (v3) was in 2019. In 2020, v6 introduced RTS elements, described as a "huge update" that "completely overhauled" the game. In 2022, v7 added the second planet, Erekir, as well as more units for Serpulo and individually selectable RTS control for units. The game has been called an "impressively unique masterwork" by PC Gamer, and a "mine out of ten" by the New Indian Express. GamingOnLinux said that, while it had similarities to other factory games like Factorio, it "manages to come off quite unique" due to a greater focus on combat and micro, and was "seriously fun", praising the pacing of the campaign mode as well as the multiplayer experience. MSN said that it was "a very in-depth game with a lot of stuff to it that can keep you entertained for a long time".
Reviewers have mentioned that the resource management aspects of the game can be complicated, requiring players to research the large number of turrets, and creating overwhelming "Nokia Snake level-10 type pattern"s of conveyor belts. A reviewer from Android Central said that it was "straight-up intimidating", but also that he was "absolutely smitten" with the game and that it was "wonderfully polished".
Mindustry was popular among US federal prison inmates, where it was sold for $2 USD on the inmate app store, until it was banned in July 2023 because "it was found to jeopardize the safety, security and orderly operation" of federal prisons.
