== Reception ==

Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting received "mixed or average" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.
Pocket Gamer lamented the unfairness of the game due to poor controls, writing, "The rare periods where everything comes together demonstrate that this could have been a perfectly playable (if not entirely original) hack and slash sim, filled with a bevy of creatures worth your time."
