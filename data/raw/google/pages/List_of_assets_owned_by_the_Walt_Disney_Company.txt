Inspector Gadget – Disney formerly owned the franchise as a whole during their limited partnership of DIC Entertainment from 1996 until 2000, before they sold DIC back to Andy Heyward. Disney also held international distribution to the original series outside North America through BVS Entertainment/Jetix Europe after their acquisition of Fox Family Worldwide in 2001, before selling it with 20 other DIC-owned programmes back to DIC in March 2006. Disney continues to hold the live-action film rights to the franchise through Walt Disney Pictures.
Talking Friends – Franchise holder Outfit7 Entertainment signed an exclusive deal with Disney in 2012 that allowed the company to produce and distribute certain media for the franchise. Among the media created as part of the limited license included a web-series from Disney Interactive, two songs from Walt Disney Records, a Disney Create - Photo Mashup game that was available on disney.go.com/create, as well as a concert event featuring Radio Disney DJs to promote the Talking Friends Superstars toyline.
