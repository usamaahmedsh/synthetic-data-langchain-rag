Las Condes is an affluent commune in northeastern Santiago, Chile, known as the country's main financial hub and one of Latin America's most prosperous urban districts. It concentrates corporate headquarters, luxury hotels, and high-rise offices in a sleek skyline locals call "Sanhattan"—a nod to its blend of Santiago and Manhattan. Beyond its business core, Las Condes is home to exclusive residential neighborhoods, top-ranked schools, and a cosmopolitan mix of international institutions and communities.


== Etymology ==

The name "Las Condes" has two competing origins. The more widely accepted theory traces it to colonial-era haciendas owned by the Counts of Sierra Bella, whose lands were colloquially called "Las Condes" rather than the grammatically correct "Los Condes." Another theory suggests Quechua roots from "Cunti," referring to the western part of the Inca Empire's Antisuyu region.


== History ==


=== Early settlement ===
The area's history dates to pre-Columbian times, with evidence of indigenous settlements from the Llolleo and Aconcagua cultures. The Inca Empire incorporated the region around 1470, establishing administrative control until Spanish conquest in the 1540s.


=== Colonial era to independence ===
During Spanish rule, the area comprised large agricultural estates. The Santa Rosa de Apoquindo manor, built in 1795, later became President Manuel Blanco Encalada's residence and now serves as a cultural center. The 19th century saw the area remain largely rural, with wealthy Santiago families maintaining country estates.


=== Modern development ===
Las Condes was officially established as a commune in 1901. Its transformation began mid-century as Santiago's expansion reached the foothills of the Andes. The 1970s-1990s witnessed rapid urbanization, with the emergence of high-rise office towers and upscale residential neighborhoods. In 1991, the commune was subdivided, creating the separate communes of Vitacura and Lo Barnechea.


== Geography ==
Located in Santiago's northeastern sector at the foothills of the Andes, Las Condes ranges from 709 to 975 meters above sea level. The terrain transitions from the flat Santiago basin to the rising slopes of the precordillera, featuring hills like Cerro Calán and Cerro Apoquindo.
The commune experiences a Mediterranean climate with winter rainfall, though higher elevations show alpine characteristics. The Mapocho River flows through the area, supplemented by the Canal San Carlos irrigation channel.


== Demographics ==
According to the 2017 census, Las Condes has 294,838 inhabitants, making it one of Santiago's most densely populated communes. It boasts Chile's highest socioeconomic indicators, with an average household income of US$67,672 (PPP) and poverty rates below 1%.
The commune hosts a significant Jewish community, with synagogues, schools, and the Estadio Israelita sports club. It also contains substantial populations of other immigrant groups, reflected in its international schools and cultural institutions.


=== Neighborhoods ===
Las Condes comprises diverse neighborhoods, from the hyper-modern "Sanhattan" financial district to established residential areas like El Golf and Los Dominicos. The commune's rapid development has created a mix of luxury high-rises, single-family homes, and commercial centers.

=== Real estate ===
The commune has experienced continuous real estate growth since the 1990s, with land values among Chile's highest. Recent metro expansions have spurred additional high-rise development, though creating traffic challenges that have prompted infrastructure improvements.
