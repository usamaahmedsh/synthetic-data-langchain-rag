Doodle Army 2: Mini Militia, commonly referred to as Mini Militia, is a 2D multiplayer action game developed by Appsomniacs LLC and published by Miniclip. The game was initially released for iOS in April 5, 2011 and later launched on Android in March 2015. It quickly became a sensation, especially within the Indian gaming community, and has been downloaded over 100 million times on the Google Play Store, where it maintains a rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Despite the game's simplistic doodle art style, it has gained significant popularity due to its fast-paced, chaotic gameplay and strong multiplayer features.


== Gameplay ==
Mini Militia is a side-scrolling shooter where players engage in fast-paced combat using a variety of weapons while navigating small maps with the help of jetpack boots. The game supports both local and online multiplayer modes, allowing players to compete against each other in matches that can include up to six participants. The control scheme includes dual-stick controls, one for movement and another for aiming and shooting. Players can pick up various weapons, including machine guns, railguns, flamethrowers, and shotguns, scattered across the map, as well as health packs and other power-ups. The gameplay is designed to be accessible, with simple mechanics that allow for quick pick-up-and-play sessions, although mastery of the controls requires practice.
The game includes several modes, such as offline survival, cooperative play, and competitive online multiplayer. The multiplayer mode is one of the game's strongest features, offering seamless connectivity for players on both iOS and Android devices. The online mode features cross-platform play, allowing users from different platforms to compete in the same game. The game has also been noted for its ability to support local multiplayer via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, making it a popular choice for group play in settings such as university cafeterias.
Despite its popularity, the game has been criticized for certain aspects of its gameplay, including its simplicity and potential for repetitiveness. While the basic mechanics are easy to learn, the limited variety in game modes and objectives can cause the experience to feel monotonous over time. Additionally, the game's control system, particularly the shooting mechanics, can be challenging for new players to master.


== Development and release ==
Mini Militia was developed by Appsomniacs LLC, a company based in the Pacific Northwest of North America. The game was initially created by Chad Towns, who later enlisted the help of Josh Neff to manage the increasing workload. Hunter Mayer also joined the team in 2012 to assist with operations, server management, and game design. The game was first released on the iOS platform in April 2011, followed by a launch on the Google Play Store in March 2015.
The game quickly gained traction in mobile gaming markets, particularly in India, where it became a cultural phenomenon. Its rise to popularity was fueled by its gameplay and multiplayer features, which resonated with the Indian gaming community. The game's success led to its acquisition by Miniclip, a subsidiary of Tencent, which took over publishing duties and convinced the developers to focus on updating the existing game rather than developing a sequel.
Over the years, the game has seen various updates that have introduced new features, weapons, and gameplay improvements. However, the core gameplay mechanics have remained largely unchanged, preserving the elements that made the game popular in the first place.

Mini Militia received generally positive reviews from both players and critics, with many praising its chaotic multiplayer experience and accessible gameplay. According to Chima Joseph Ugo of Prime 9ja Online, the game excels in delivering fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled matches that can be played anytime, anywhere. However, he also noted that the game's simplicity could lead to a repetitive experience over time, as there is limited depth in the available game modes and objectives. Rumman R Kalam of The Daily Star echoed similar sentiments, highlighting the game's fast-paced action and the rewarding feeling of mastering its controls. Kalam also mentioned that the game is a popular choice among university students in Bangladesh, where it is often played during breaks between classes.
Aditya Madanapalle of Firstpost praised the game's seamless multiplayer experience, particularly its ability to connect players via Bluetooth or local Wi-Fi. He compared the game's rounds to those of Counter-Strike, noting that despite the cartoonish graphics, the gameplay is intense and engaging. Madanapalle also pointed out the game's unique combination of doodle-style graphics and chaotic combat, which sets it apart from other mobile shooters. However, he did criticize the game's control system, particularly the shooting mechanics, which can be difficult for new players to master.
In a review by Hope Harry for The Board, Mini Militia was praised for its fast-paced gameplay and intuitive controls, earning a score of 4.5 out of 5 stars. Harry highlighted the game's chaotic multiplayer battles and the variety of game modes, such as Capture the Flag and Team Deathmatch, which keep the experience engaging and suitable for both casual and competitive players. The review also noted the depth offered by the customization options, allowing players to experiment with different weapons and playstyles. While the simplistic, cartoonish graphics were considered charming and fitting for the game's tone, the sound design was described as functional, enhancing the overall gameplay experience. Despite some concerns about monetization and the reliance on online connectivity, Harry concluded that Mini Militia is a "fantastic" mobile shooter with a rating of 4 out of 5 stars overall, recommending it for anyone seeking a "quick and action-packed" game.
