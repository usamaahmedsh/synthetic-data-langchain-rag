== History ==
iCore Networks was founded in 2001 by Stephen Canton, a business executive who worked for Excel Communications prior to founding iCore Networks. He launched the company in 2003 with a $7 million personal investment and the company signed its first customer in 2004. The company's services included managing VoPI networks, similar to VoIP networks. As opposed to using private point to point circuits like VoIP, iCore Networks uses a managed and hosted end-to-end system to eliminate poor call quality. The company raised an additional $6.4 million in capital in 2006 that the company used to upgrade its network facilities. It also partnered with Global Telecom & Technology in 2008 in order to strengthen its infrastructure. By 2009 the company reported revenues of approximate $25 million per year.
As of 2010, iCore Networks has boasted of having more than 75 employees and a 98% approval rating from approximately 27,000 users. The same year, it expanded operations in 2010 by adding an office in Columbia, Maryland. Two years later in 2012, iCore Networks relocated the Columbia office to a larger facility in the same town. Its customer base doubled in the two years prior to the relocation, with the company adding 40 employees. In 2012 iCore Networks acquired cloud communications provider, Always On Call.  With the acquisition, iCore Networks expanded its cloud solutions to include Unified Communications (UC), Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), Microsoft Application Collaboration, and Desktop Virtualization.
