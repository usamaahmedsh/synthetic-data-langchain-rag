AI Overviews is an artificial intelligence (AI) feature integrated into Google Search that produces AI-generated summaries of search results. The feature has been widely criticized as producing misleading, nonsensical, and potentially dangerous claims, as well as taking traffic away from content websites.


== History and development ==
AI Overviews was first introduced as part of Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE), which was unveiled at the Google I/O conference in May 2023. In May 2024, the feature was rebranded as AI Overviews and launched in the United States. The introduction of AI Overviews was seen as a strategic move to compete with other generative AI advancements, including OpenAI's ChatGPT.
By August 2024, AI Overviews was rolled out to several other countries, including the United Kingdom, India, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia, with support for multiple languages. In October 2024, Google expanded the feature globally, making it available in over 100 countries.
In December 2024, Botify x Demandsphere released findings stating that when AI Overviews and Featured Snippets appear in the SERP together, they take up approximately 67.1% of the screen on desktop and 75.7% of the screen on mobile. Even if content is ranking in the #1 position, it may not be visible to consumers depending on the other visual elements on the results page.
In March 2025, Google started testing an "AI Mode", where all of the content is AI-generated. The company was also considering adding ads to the AI Mode, as they already exist in AI Overviews.
As of May 2025, AI Overviews are now available in over 200 countries and territories, and more than 40 languages.


== Functionality ==
The AI Overviews feature uses advanced machine learning algorithms to generate summaries based on diverse web content. The overviews are designed to be concise, providing a snapshot of relevant information on the queried topic. To enhance user interaction, Google allows users to adjust the complexity of the language in the summaries, offering both simplified and detailed options.
The feature also includes prominent links to source content, ensuring that users can access more in-depth information directly from authoritative websites. 
As of October 2024, Google has implemented inline links within AI Overviews, allowing users to directly access source content within the generated summaries, enhancing user engagement with authoritative sources.


== Reception ==
AI Overviews received mixed feedback upon its introduction. Many users appreciated the convenience of obtaining immediate and relevant information without navigating through multiple search results. However, early iterations of the feature faced criticism for inaccuracies, including instances where erroneous or nonsensical content was generated. Google addressed these issues by improving content validation and refining the algorithms used to filter unreliable information.
Concerns were also raised by content publishers, who feared a decline in web traffic as users relied on the summaries instead of visiting source websites. In response, Google implemented measures to prioritize link placement within AI Overviews, aiming to balance user convenience with the needs of content creators.


== Criticism and challenges ==

Since its introduction, the feature has faced ongoing scrutiny. Critics argue that relying on AI-generated summaries may perpetuate inaccuracies or oversimplify complex topics. Furthermore, there is apprehension about the ethical implications of AI-driven content aggregation, including its impact on intellectual property rights and the visibility of smaller content providers. Depending on what is searched for, the overview may also consist of hallucinated content, such as when searching for idioms that do not exist.
In response, Google has stated its commitment to addressing these challenges by continuously refining the system and engaging with stakeholders to ensure a balanced and accurate search ecosystem. In May 2024, Google temporarily restricted the AI tool after it provided nonsensical and harmful suggestions, such as telling users to eat rocks or apply glue on pizza.


=== Lawsuits ===
On February 24, 2025, Chegg sued Alphabet over the AI Overviews feature, claiming that it was leading to students preferring "low-quality, unverified AI summaries", thus violating antitrust law. Chegg also said it was considering either a sale or a take-private transaction.
In September 2025, Penske Media Corporation, the publisher of Rolling Stone and The Hollywood Reporter, sued Google, claiming that AI Overviews illegally regurgitate content from their websites and drive off potential site visitors by always appearing on top of the search results while leaving little incentive to see the linked sources. The company stated that "the future of digital media and [...] its integrity [...] is threatened by Google's current actions", alledging that 20% of searches that link to Penske-owned websites show AI Overviews and that the figure is expected to rise. Google spokesperson José Castañeda called the claims "meritless" and stated that "AI Overviews send traffic to a greater diversity of sites."
