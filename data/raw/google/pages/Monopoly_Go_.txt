== Gameplay ==
Monopoly Go! is a single-player mobile board game video game that mixes the aesthetics of classic Monopoly with a mobile gaming loop. Players start out with ownership of all properties and roll dice to make money which can be used to upgrade one of five landmarks, which are unique to each themed board (such as Tokyo Tower on the Tokyo board). Players also encounter events like bank heists or take-downs which let them win money from other players, which was marketed as a light social feature of the game. The number of die rolls per day are limited, but their value can be optimized through gameplay, or additional rolls can be purchased.
A recurrent mini-game called Treasure Hunting is another aspect of Monopoly Go that allows the player to find hidden objects for rewards. Like other events, these mini-games are themed and only playable for a short period of time—usually a few days. All Treasure Hunts revolve around the basic gameplay of tapping squares on a grid to reveal objects. The player needs special tokens called "pickaxes" or "shovels" in order to uncover the squares.


== Reception ==
Reviewers criticized various aspects of Monopoly Go!. Rachel Mogan from Android Central praised the game's appealing visuals, smooth gameplay, and impressive sound. However, she stated that it is "abundantly clear that Monopoly GO! is one of the many mobile games designed for the sole purpose of making as much money as it possibly can". Writing for Destructoid, CJ Andriessen criticized the game for having intrusive in-game ads.
