OnForce was a Freelancer Management System (FMS) for Field Services that enabled companies to search for, engage with, manage, and pay non-employee professionals. Based out of Lexington, Massachusetts, it was a former independent business unit of Adecco Group.


== History ==
ComputerRepair.com was founded by Jeffrey Leventhal in Boca Raton, FL and launched its initial IT service-matching web application in
February 2003.  The business evolved its platform into an online marketplace transacting millions of service events by 2005. The business focused on the IT services industry and the platform allowed its clients to create assignments, match them to workers, and then pay for completed work.  In December
2005 the business was renamed OnForce and raised a $15 million Series A round.   Around 2007 OnForce introduced PowerMatch, a bi-directional matching algorithm to find field service technicians. In May 2008 the company expanded to consumer electronics and
introduced a general contractor model in 2010. 


=== Acquisition ===
In August 2014, Adecco Group, a Swiss multinational human resource consulting company acquired OnForce FMS and merged with its VMS company. In the agreement, Beeline agreed to partner with OnForce's freelance management system to give clients and partners access to the supply chain of the workforce. OnForce was acquired by WorkMarket in 2017.
