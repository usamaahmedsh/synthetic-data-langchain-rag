Just Dance Now is a video game in the Just Dance series developed and published by Ubisoft. It was released on September 25, 2014, in both the App Store and Google Play. The trailer for the game was revealed at E3 2014 on June 9, 2014, as a spin-off title. Without the purchase of a VIP pass, a free version of the game with limited plays is available.


== Gameplay ==
Just Dance Now is intended for people who may not have access to a console to play the original games. As with the original games, players must mimic the on-screen dancer's choreography to a chosen song. The app version uses an Internet connection to the Just Dance Now website through either a television, a computer, a laptop, a tablet, a Chromecast or an Apple TV. The phone acts as a motion controller, much like the Wii Remote. Multiple players may connect simultaneously, and there is no limit to the number of players allowed.
Since the June 2017 update, the game now allows players to play any song or routine of their choosing for in-game currency instead of the previous model of providing a playlist offering limited free songs. The app offers a library of songs requiring a time-limited VIP pass which can be purchased through the app, or with coins which are automatically earned overtime or purchased through the app. As of April 2024, the game contains 614 songs, excluding alternate routines and including "You're On My Mind" from Just Dance 2015.
