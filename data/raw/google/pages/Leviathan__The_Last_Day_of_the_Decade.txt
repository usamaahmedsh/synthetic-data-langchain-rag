== Development and release ==
Lostwood Games started to develop the game in 2012. Andrey Kniazev, the leader of the Russian team that created the game, spent $150,000 to develop Leviathan. Due to the themes of homosexuality and the current state of LGBT rights in Russia, the team initially had a hard time finding a publisher. However, they did find a publisher for the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita versions, but  they lacked the money to make a port. The game features an opening song, composed by Gleb Kolyadin and Mikhail Kotov, and performed by Nikita Valamin and Maryana Semkina. The original Russian game has been translated into English and German. The German translations of the first two episodes were released in August 2013. In May 2014, they launched a crowdfunding project on Indiegogo to fund the final episode. Funding failed with the game only receiving $195 of the $49,500 goal. Nonetheless, the still want to create the last episode and finish the translations for episode 4 and 5. The game was released on Steam on November 11, 2014. In November 2015, they launched another crowdfunding project on Indiegogo with a goal of $2,000 in order to finish the English translation of the last episode. Funding failed again with the game only receiving $429.
