Google King's Cross is an office building under construction in King's Cross, London, forming part of the Knowledge Quarter in King's Cross Central. It will be the headquarters of Google in the United Kingdom. It is the first building owned and designed by Google outside the United States. It is remarkable for being a long building, dubbed a 'landscraper', being 72 metres (236 ft) tall at its highest point and 330 metres (1,080 ft) long and will consist of 11 stories providing a total of 861,100sq ft of office space upon completion, making it the 8th largest building in Europe by office space. It is designed to home 7,000 staff and will replace Google's current office a street away on Pancras Square.
It is expected to open later in 2025.
