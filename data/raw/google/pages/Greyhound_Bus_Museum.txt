The Greyhound Bus Museum is located in Hibbing, Minnesota, United States, where Carl Wickman and Andrew "Bus Andy" Anderson started their first bus service in 1914 transporting fellow miners in a 1914 Hupmobile.


== Company history ==
In 1914, Eric Wickman, a 27-year-old Swedish immigrant, started a transportation service with Andy "Bus Andy" Anderson and C. A. A. "Arvid" Heed to transport iron ore miners in Minnesota. By 1918, the company had 18 vehicles and merged with Ralph Bogan to form the Mesaba Transportation Company. Wickman later expanded the company to various locations and eventually rebranded it as The Greyhound Corporation in 1930.


== Museum history ==
The museum was established in September of 1989 by Gene Nicolelli, a local resident who discovered a plaque honoring Hibbing as the birthplace of the bus industry in an abandoned Greyhound terminal.
Initially called the Greyhound Bus Origin Center and located in the Hibbing Municipal Building, the museum has grown to include a collection of historical buses and memorabilia related to the Greyhound Lines. .

The museum houses a collection of artifacts and vehicles that chronicle the history of the Greyhound Lines bus company.
