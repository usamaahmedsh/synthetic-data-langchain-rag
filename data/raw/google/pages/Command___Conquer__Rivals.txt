The player can play as GDI or Brotherhood of Nod, with each faction offering unique abilities, and units. Players are tasked to control platforms surrounding the missile silo. If the player manages to gain control of more platforms than the enemy for a fixed time, the missile will launch and obliterate the opponent's base.


== Development ==
The game was revealed at EA Play 2018 with a live gameplay demo, making it the first Command & Conquer game from EA since 2012's Command & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances. A pre-alpha version of the game was released on Google Play on the same day. Greg Black, who had worked on various Command & Conquer games, was hired to design the game's combat.


== Reception ==
