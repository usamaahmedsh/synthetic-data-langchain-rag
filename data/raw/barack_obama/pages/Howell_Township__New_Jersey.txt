== History ==
Howell Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 23, 1801, from portions of Shrewsbury Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Brick Township in the newly created Ocean County (February 15, 1850), Wall Township (March 7, 1851) and Farmingdale (April 8, 1903). The township was named for Richard Howell, who served from 1794 to 1801 as the third Governor of New Jersey.
Founded in 1822 by engineer and philanthropist James P. Allaire, the Howell Works provided iron for Allaire Iron Works, which was a leading supplier of iron in the 19th century. Allaire Village was a bustling mill town at the height of the mining operations and it has been preserved as Allaire State Park, which is in Howell Township and Wall Township.
Some scenes for the War of the Worlds 2005 remake were filmed here, and a neighborhood called Ardena Acres was recreated as a set and left standing in Universal Studios Hollywood.
In June 2017, two separate tornadoes, both rated EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, struck minutes and miles apart. The first one struck the Fort Plains area, damaging a Home Depot, Chase Bank, a strip mall, and a local ice cream parlor. The second one struck a park in the Oak Glen area.
Roughly six years later in April 2023, a tornado rated EF-2 struck Howell and neighboring Jackson Township near the Aldrich Road area. The National Weather Service confirmed that the tornado was 50 yards wide and 1.4 miles in length. It was one of the strongest tornadoes to have hit the state, as it was part of four separate powerful tornadoes that had also impacted the state that same day.


=== Alleged profiling of residents for purchasing beer ===
In September 2025, the former deputy township manager of Howell Township filed a suit, alleging that the township ""weaponize housing regulations to punish individuals based on their ethnicity, immigration status, and/or perceived national origin."  He alleged that Mayor John Leggio and Councilman Ian Nadel suggested searching through residents' garbage in an effort to find bottles of Modelo, a Mexican beer brand, to target Hispanic residents.


=== Alleged antisemitic profiling ===
The former deputy township manager also alleged that Councilman Nadel sought to have code enforcement employees stake out a home because it was "owned by Jews" and was used to celebrate the Sabbath.

Howell was formed from territory taken from Shrewsbury Township under an act of the New Jersey General Assembly passed February 23, 1801. The township, as formed, included in addition to its present area all of what is now Wall Township, Lakewood Township, Brick Township, and all the boroughs along the Atlantic Ocean from Barnegat Inlet of the Shark River Inlet at Belmar.

=== Ecology ===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Howell Township would predominantly feature an Appalachian Oak (type 104) vegetation type, with an Eastern Hardwood Forest (vegetation form 25).
Howell is located within the Outer Coastal Plain ecoregion of New Jersey, characterized by sandy soils and a mix of pine-oak forests and wetlands. Its natural ecosystems include upland oak-hickory woodlands, pine barrens transition zones, and freshwater marshes. These habitats support white-tailed deer, red foxes, wild turkeys, box turtles, and amphibians like spring peepers and wood frogs.
The Manasquan Reservoir, a 1,204-acre site operated by the Monmouth County Park System, is one of Howell’s most ecologically significant areas. It provides habitat for nesting bald eagles, ospreys, great blue herons, and migratory waterfowl. The park also features native wetland plant species, reforested buffer zones, and interpretive trails for conservation education.
Bear Swamp Natural Area, located along Maxim-Southard Road, is a forested wetland that supports a mix of red maple, tupelo, and sweetgum trees, and functions as a critical recharge area for the township’s aquifer. Local conservation groups have identified it as a biodiversity hotspot and a priority for habitat protection.
The Howell Environmental Commission works with local and regional partners to preserve open space, implement native planting projects, and maintain an index of environmentally sensitive lands. In 2022, the township adopted a resolution endorsing New Jersey's Wildlife Action Plan to guide long-term stewardship of native habitats and species.
The Bog Creek Farm Superfund site is an EPA-designated Superfund site located on County Road 547 in the township.
