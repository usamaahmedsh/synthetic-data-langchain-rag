== Career ==
Maxwell previously served as national field director for Jobs with Justice, where she helped quadruple the number of local affiliates, with similar growth in the organization's national staff. As a result, the organization engaged new allies, mobilized support, and built relationships with stakeholders to broaden and strengthen the causes of worker and economic justice.
Prior to Jobs with Justice, she was deputy field director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, directing the pro-choice organization’s electoral, legislative, media and fundraising training programs for local affiliates.  She also served as field director for the United States Student Association where she designed field programs to organize students in targeted congressional districts to impact higher education policy, and managed a leadership development and grassroots action program, which mobilized thousands of students.
She currently sits on the board of directors of The Discount Foundation.
Maxwell was rumored to be a serious candidate for Secretary of Labor in Barack Obama's administration. She would have been the first openly lesbian cabinet secretary.  Instead, Obama selected Hilda Solis, a member of Congress.
