== History ==

Mount Laurel was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 7, 1872, from portions of Evesham Township. The township was named for a hill covered with laurel trees.
Several historical landmarks include General Clinton's headquarters, Paulsdale, Evesham Friends Meeting House, Jacob's Chapel, Hattie Britt School, and Farmer's Hall.


=== Mount Laurel Doctrine ===
The Mount Laurel Doctrine is a final NJ Supreme Court’s interpretation of the New Jersey State Constitution that requires municipalities to use their zoning powers in an affirmative manner to provide a realistic opportunity for the production of housing affordable to low and moderate-income households. The decision was a result of a lawsuit brought against the town by the N.A.A.C.P. that was decided by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1975 and reaffirmed in a subsequent decision in 1983.
The history behind this, and the story leading to the decision was highlighted in Our Town, a book by David L. Kirp.
Mount Laurel was a small, rural farming community until it was hit with massive suburban growth from Philadelphia in the later 1960s. In 1970, at a meeting about a proposal for taxpayer subsidized housing held at an all-black church in Mount Laurel, Mayor Bill Haines summed up the NIMBYist perspective by saying: "If you people can't afford to live in our town, then you'll just have to leave."
Even though the black families in Mount Laurel were not from urban ghettos and were not involved in gang activity, the new suburban influx thought otherwise, and significantly delayed the creation of tax-payer subsidized housing areas, citing concerns of gang activity and an influx of inner-city criminals. Example comments from town meetings against forced construction of housing projects included "...we need this like Custer needed more Indians..."; "...it's reverse discrimination..."; "...we lived in this in South Philly and Newark...", and that the housing would be a "...breeding ground for violent crime and drug abuse..."
As time went on, Mount Laurel did in fact experience high crime rates, and today is more dangerous than 83% of every other town and city of all sizes in the State of New Jersey, and more dangerous than 82% of all other U.S. cities. The chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime in Mount Laurel is 1 in 46. Based on FBI crime data, the chance that a person will become a victim of a violent crime in Mount Laurel - such as armed robbery, aggravated assault, rape or murder - is 1 in 540. This equates to a rate of 2 per one thousand inhabitants. And Mount Laurel's rate for property crime is 20 per one thousand population.
Leading advocate in favor of taxpayer subsidized housing Ethel Lawrence, a black resident who lived her life in Mount Laurel, had her house repeatedly vandalized. Although the court ruled in favor of creating taxpayer subsidized housing, residents did manage to delay the process for decades.
