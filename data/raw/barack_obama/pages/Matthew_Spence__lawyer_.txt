== Views on U.S. Middle East policy ==
In a July 2015 interview with Politico about Obama's approach toward Iran, Spence said: “There’s a real potential benefit when American and Iranian diplomats have been talking so much and so intensively over the last 20 months. We can try to leverage those diplomatic contacts to see if there are any possibilities that would arise from common interests in the region.” He continued: “At the same time, the U.S. needs to signal that it’s not naive about Iran’s intentions and behavior in the region beyond the nuclear issue.”
In a January 2016 interview with Politico, Spence noted that “Egypt was one of the most significant policy divides between the White House and the State Department and the Department of Defense.”
