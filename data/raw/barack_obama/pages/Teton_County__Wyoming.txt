== History ==
Teton County was created February 15, 1921, from a portion of Lincoln County. Its governing organization was completed in 1922. The county was named for the Teton Range. The county was created because the inhabitants lived too far away from Kemmerer, the county seat of Lincoln County. The creation of the county required a special act of the Wyoming Legislature, because the area was too poor and had too few people to qualify for county status under the normal requirements.

== Politics ==
Liz Skalka of the Huffpost described Teton as a "liberal county" in August 2022. Previously a staunchly Republican county, which produced Governor and U.S. Senator Clifford Hansen, a mass immigration of wealthy liberals from the West Coast has made Teton County the most Democratic county in Wyoming, which is one of the most Republican states in the nation. The only Republican presidential candidate since 1992 to win Teton County was George W. Bush in 2000 who had county resident Dick Cheney on the ticket. In the 2008 election, Barack Obama carried Teton County by a 23.6 percentage point margin over John McCain, with McCain winning statewide by a 32.2 percentage point margin over Obama, his widest margin in any state. Albany County, which includes the University of Wyoming at Laramie, was the only other county in the state to have backed Obama. In 2004, Teton was the only Wyoming county won by John F. Kerry over George W. Bush. In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 57.9%–31.1%.
In 2020, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by 37.5%, the largest margin for a Democrat ever in the county. In 2024 it was the only county to vote for Democrat Kamala Harris, despite Trump winning 71.6% of the vote in Wyoming, the highest vote share ever won in the state.
The county has, however, voted at times for Republican candidates for the governorship and United States Senate. Most recently, the county voted for Republican Mark Gordon for governor in 2022, although by the slimmest margin of any county in Wyoming.
