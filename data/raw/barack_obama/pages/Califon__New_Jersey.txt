Califon is a borough in Hunterdon County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 1,005, a decrease of 71 (−6.6%) from the 2010 census count of 1,076, which in turn reflected an increase of 21 (+2.0%) from the 1,055 counted in the 2000 census.
The borough's name is said to have been inspired by the California gold rush of 1849. The name was shortened to Califon, supposedly because the longer name could not be fit on signs at the train station.


== History ==

Califon was a station on the High Bridge Branch of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The station was built in 1875 and is now used as a museum by the Califon Historical Society. The rail line was abandoned in 1976 and now serves as a Hunterdon County-administered rail trail called Columbia Trail, which runs south to High Bridge and north to points in Morris County.
Though the mills were present in the area of Califon for some time prior to its incorporation as a town, it was quite a while before growth became evident in the mid-nineteenth century. The J. K. Apgar Farmhouse, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, exemplifies the early stone farmhouses constructed in the region in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The area that would become Califon was first called California, from Jacob Neighbor's enthusiasm in the milling business about the time the California Gold Rush broke out. The borough was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of both Lebanon and Tewksbury Townships on April 2, 1918.
Local legend has it that California became a regular stop for weekend excursion trains through the countryside. When riders bought their tickets they were issued a voucher good for an ice cream; the train would stop so tourists could wander around and cash in their ice cream coupons. Anxious to exploit this source of outside revenue, residents petitioned the railroad to let them build a real station, which they did as a community project. Citing the local account again, two sign painters who came to letter the sign rode the train from Dunellen, but the background paint wasn't dry when they arrived. They sat and drank at the hotel, which later burned down. By the time the sign was ready for their artistic touch, the local tale says, "Califon" was as close to California as the inebriated painters could manage.
Califon is situated just north of the Ken Lockwood Gorge on the South Branch of the Raritan River; this pristine stretch of clear water and forest is a well-known treasure for New Jersey trout fishermen. It is regularly restocked by the state fisheries service.

The center of Califon is the historic iron bridge spanning the South Branch of the Raritan River, which divides the borough. Recently the State of New Jersey announced that the bridge would be replaced because a loaded school bus represented more weight than the aging bridge could safely carry. Incensed citizens objected, protective of the landmark, and found a colorful but simple solution; the school bus stops at one end of the bridge unloading the students, who then walk across to the other side. Then the empty bus, within imposed weight limits, drives across and the students get back on the bus to continue their ride. Thus the bridge was saved. (Account featured on Califon website).
The 1943 short story, "The Greatest Gift," was set in a town inspired by Califon and adapted into the 1946 classic film It's a Wonderful Life. Author Philip Van Doren Stern said in a 1946 interview, "Incidentally, the movie takes place in Westchester County. Actually, the town I had in mind was Califon, N.J." The historic iron bridge in Califon is similar to the bridge that George Bailey considered jumping from in the movie.
Califon became a regional household name when frequently mentioned by Merv Griffin on his TV show during the 1970s. He and his wife Juliette owned a home in nearby Lebanon Township, which had a Califon mailing address, and, while they were married, they were often seen visiting the village in a fringed-top Bermuda-style resort cart, though they lived over 2 miles away. Califon Productions created all of his television ventures.
Hoffman's Crossing was named for Issac Hoffman, who farmed land that lies just south of Califon Bridge, along present day County Route 513.


== Historic district ==

The Califon Historic District is a 164-acre (66 ha) historic district encompassing much of the borough. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 14, 1976, for its significance in commerce. The district includes 154 contributing buildings, three contributing structures, and one contributing site. It was created through the efforts of the Califon Historical Society. Califon is a Victorian-style enclave where the houses are marked with the names of the builders and their dates of establishment rather than with street numbers.
The Joseph Tiger House was built of stone in 1846. A stone raceway runs under the former Beatty's Store, indicating a possible mill site. The mid-19th century house at 1 First Street features a gable roof with an intersecting dormer. The Califon Main Street Bridge is a Pratt thru truss design built in 1887 by I. P. Bartley & Co. of Morris County.

Califon is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Califon is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2023, the mayor of Califon Borough is Democrat Charles Daniel, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Califon Borough Council are Council President Michael P.
