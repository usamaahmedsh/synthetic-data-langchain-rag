Barnegat Township (pronounced "BAR-nuh-git") is a township in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 24,296, the highest ever count at a decennial census and an increase of 3,360 (+16.0%) from the 2010 census count of 20,936, which in turn reflected an increase of 5,666 (+37.1%) from the 15,270 counted in the 2000 census.
What is now Barnegat Township was originally incorporated as Union Township on March 10, 1846, from portions of both Dover Township (now Toms River Township) and Stafford Township, while the area was still part of Monmouth County. It became part of the newly formed Ocean County on February 15, 1850. Portions of the township were taken to form Lacey Township (March 23, 1871), Ocean Township (April 13, 1876), Harvey Cedars (December 13, 1894) and Long Beach Township (March 23, 1899). Union Township changed its name to Barnegat Township as of January 1, 1977.


== History ==
Barnegat's name can be traced back to Dutch explorers who, in 1614, mapped the coastline of the nearby Barnegat Bay and Barnegat Inlet. The original name for the inlet was "Barendegat" or "Barnde Gat," which translates to "inlet of the breakers" or "surf cove". These names were given due to the turbulent channel of the inlet, which is characterized by strong currents and choppy waters. An alternative theory suggests that "Barndegat" is a Dutch term meaning "a pool created from a dike breach".
Long before European settlers arrived, the Lenape Native Americans inhabited the region, including the area now known as Barnegat. The Lenape would spend their summers along the shore, collecting and roasting clams for sustenance during the winter months. They also fished, hunted, and gathered various fruits and nuts found in the area.
European settlers, primarily Dutch, English, and Swedes, began to arrive in the Barnegat area around 1720. These settlers were attracted to the region's fertile land, abundant natural resources, and proximity to the coastline. The first permanent homes in Barnegat were constructed around 1750, as the settlers established farms, fisheries, and other small businesses.
Barnegat played a role in the American Revolutionary War, as one of the last skirmishes of the conflict took place near the site of the Cedar Bridge Tavern in 1782. Known as the "Battle of Cedar Bridge," this encounter involved Patriot forces clashing with Loyalist troops and local Pine Robbers, who took advantage of the war's chaos to engage in banditry. The Patriots eventually emerged victorious, marking a symbolic end to the Revolutionary War in New Jersey.
