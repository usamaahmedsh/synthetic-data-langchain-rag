Woodland Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 1,544, a decrease of 244 (−13.6%) from the 2010 census count of 1,788, which in turn reflected an increase of 618 (+52.8%) from the 1,170 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.
Woodland was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 7, 1866, from portions of Pemberton Township, Shamong Township, Southampton Township and Washington Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Tabernacle Township on March 22, 1901.


== History ==
The area now known as Woodland Township was originally inhabited by the Lenape Native American tribe. European settlers began arriving in the late 17th century, attracted by the fertile soil and abundant lumber resources. The settlers cleared land for farming and built homes and other structures using local materials, including wood and sandstone.
Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Woodland was predominantly an agricultural community, with farming being the primary occupation for most residents. The fertile soil in the region was ideal for growing a variety of crops, including corn, wheat, and potatoes. In addition to crop farming, livestock, dairy, and poultry farming also played a significant role in the local economy.
In the early 20th century, several small-scale industries began to emerge in Woodland, including sawmills, gristmills, and blacksmith shops. These industries relied heavily on the local resources, such as timber and iron ore, and provided employment opportunities for the residents.
In the latter half of the 20th century, Woodland experienced a shift away from agriculture and towards a more diversified economy. Although farming remained an important aspect of the township's identity, the focus shifted to include manufacturing, retail, and service-based industries.
The township has a mix of residential, commercial, and agricultural areas, reflecting its multifaceted history. Woodland is known for its landscapes, including the scenic Brendan T. Byrne State Forest, which offers numerous recreational opportunities such as hiking, camping, and birdwatching.
