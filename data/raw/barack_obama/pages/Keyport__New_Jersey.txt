Keyport is a borough in northern Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A waterfront community located on the Raritan Bay in the Raritan Valley region, the borough is a commuter town of New York City in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 7,204, a decrease of 36 (−0.5%) from the 2010 census count of 7,240, which in turn reflected a decline of 328 (−4.3%) from the 7,568 counted in the 2000 census. Keyport's nickname is the "Pearl of the Bayshore" or the "Gateway to the Bayshore".
Keyport was originally formed as a town on March 17, 1870, from portions of Raritan Township (now Hazlet). On April 2, 1908, the Borough of Keyport was formed, replacing Keyport Town.
Keyport was part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area's economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, dense residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural Raritan Bayshore coastline. The plan has since been integrated into the 2016 Monmouth County Master Plan. According to the Monmouth County Master Plan, Keyport is one of eight municipalities that has been designated as an Arts, Cultural, and Entertainment (ACE) Hub, which is defined as municipalities that have a high concentration of arts and cultural activities to serve as a destination for both visitors and locals, usually including an active nightlife scene in proximity to said cultural activities.

The Great Fire of September 21, 1877, caused significant damage to Keyport, including extensive sections of the main business district. A total of 31 buildings were destroyed, resulting in losses from the fire of $160,000 (equivalent to $4,700,000 in 2024). Local firefighters only had access to water from a cistern and could not pump water directly from the nearby Raritan Bay. Properties destroyed in the fire included the boyhood home of Garret Hobart, future Vice President of the United States.

== Economy ==

Keyport is known for its oyster industry, which had been one of the world's largest suppliers until overfishing and pollution led to a collapse of the industry in the early to mid 20th century. In August 2010, NY/NJ Baykeeper suspended an effort to recreate the oyster reefs in Keyport's Raritan Bay after the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection cited concerns that the oysters could be harvested and sold to the public despite the persistent heavy pollution in the water after concerns had been raised by the United States Food and Drug Administration that patrols were insufficient to ensure that the oysters in the reef were not being harvested.
It was the home of the Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company which operated from 1914 to 1930 and built seaplanes for the United States Navy during World War I. Its planes were mostly military seaplanes and flying boats, including aircraft that offered some of the first scheduled air service using seaplanes.
Keyport has been credited as the birthplace of the "Lazy Susan", designed by William Bedle in 1845. However this is highly disputed since there were earlier dated pieces found in China and England. It was the site of the professional dance debut of film star Fred Astaire in 1903 at age four, together with his sister Adele, as part of an act that earned a review that called the duo "the greatest child act in vaudeville.


=== Business district ===
Keyport is home to many diverse businesses, and has a bustling shopping district located on West Front Street, located one block in from the waterfront. The business district is now under control of the Keyport Bayfront Business Cooperative (which was established in 2011 to replace the now-defunct Keyport Business Alliance) which helps to organize events that benefit the businesses in Keyport as well as the city as a whole.
Keyport is home to many restaurants, many with live music. Celebrity Chef Bobby Flay filmed a segment for CBS Sunday Morning at the Broad Street Diner, which has won numerous awards and accolades.


== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Keyport is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the Borough Council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council is comprised of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The Borough form of government used by Keyport is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council.
As of 2025, the mayor of Keyport is Republican Rose P. Araneo, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Borough Council members are Council President Melissa Vecchio (R, 2025), Heather B. Brady (D, 2026), Stephen D. Gross (D, 2026), Joseph Merla (R, 2027), Kathleen McNamara (D, 2027), Cathleen Reilly (R, 2025).
J. Christopher Demarest was selected by the borough council in January 2023 from a list of three  residents nominated by the Republican municipal committee to temporarily fill the seat expiring in December 2024 that became vacant when Rose P. Araneo took office as mayor; Demarest will serve on an interim basis until the November 2023 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.
On Election Day, November 7, 2007, Council President Robert Bergen was elected Mayor, taking the seat of two-term incumbent John J. Merla who pled guilty to federal corruption charges on January 18, 2007, for accepting bribes to obtain municipal contracts. Bergen assumed the post of Mayor on January 1, 2007.
