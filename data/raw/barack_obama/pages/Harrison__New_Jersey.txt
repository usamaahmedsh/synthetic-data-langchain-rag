Harrison is a town in the western part of Hudson County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is part of the New York metropolitan area. It is a suburb of the nearby city of Newark, and is located 8 miles (13 km) from New York City. Once considered "the beehive of industry", the town is undergoing a residential and economic renewal, particularly along the Passaic River.
As of the 2020 United States census, the town's population was 19,450, an increase of 5,830 (+42.8%) from the 2010 census count of 13,620, which in turn reflected a decrease of 804 (−5.6%) from the 14,424 counted in the 2000 census. The Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 22,182 for 2024.


== History ==


=== Colonial era to 19th century ===
The area that is now Harrison was the southernmost part of the 15,308-acre (23.919 sq mi; 61.95 km2) land grant awarded to William Sandford in 1668. When that grant was divided in 1671 between Sandford and his uncle, Nathaniel Kingsland of Barbados, Sandford's 5,000-acre (2,000 ha) share included Harrison. While Sandford and his family established a plantation on the northern portion of his tract, there is no evidence they developed any significant part of Harrison. Upon his death in 1691, Sandford's land passed to his wife, Sarah Sandford (née Whartman). Upon her death c. 1719, she passed most of the land, including Harrison, to her son William (c. 1670–1733). In 1729, William transferred the southern parts of his upland to three of his sons, John, Robert and Peter, each receiving a 300-acre (120 ha) lot that included a portion of Harrison's upland. John and Robert sold their lots to members of the Schuyler family in 1733 and 1736, respectively, and migrated westward, John to Newark and Robert to Pine Brook. The disposition of Peter's lot is not known, but no further record of him is found in or near Harrison.
A road to the Hudson Waterfront was completed in 1750, named for Douwe's Ferry which it met at its eastern end to cross the Hackensack River. In 1790 the state legislature decided that "public good would be served by a 64-foot road from Paulus Hook to Newark Courthouse". By 1795, a bridge over the Hackensack 950 feet (290 m) long and another over the Passaic 492 feet (150 m) long (at the site of the Bridge Street Bridge) were built creating an uninterrupted toll road connection. It is now known as the Newark-Jersey City Turnpike.
In 1826, the New Jersey Legislature formed Lodi Township from the southern portion of New Barbadoes Neck in Bergen County. Since Lodi Township was part of Bergen County, matters dealing with the county government and courts had to be taken to Hackensack.
In 1840, the inhabitants of Lodi Township joined with present-day Secaucus, Bayonne, Jersey City, Hoboken, Weehawken, and Union City and petitioned for the creation of a new county due to the great distance which the petitioners had to travel to reach the county seat in Hackensack. This appeal resulted in the creation of Hudson County and the first mention of Harrison occurs in the law which was passed on April 13, 1840. Harrison Township was thereby established.
The first committee meeting of the Township of Harrison was held on April 16, 1840, and it is widely accepted that Harrison was named for President William Henry Harrison, who was elected that year.


=== 19th century to present ===
Union Township (now Lyndhurst) was created as of February 19, 1852, from portions of the township and became part of Bergen County.
General N. N. Halstead succeeded in getting the necessary laws passed in Trenton and on April 8, 1867, Kearny became a separate Township from land that was a part of Harrison, which included East Newark at the time; East Newark later seceded from Kearny, establishing their own Borough. On March 25, 1869, Harrison town was incorporated, replacing the township.
While campaigning for re-election in 1912, President William Howard Taft told residents gathered for a rally that "you have reason to be proud of this Hive of Industry", from which was coined the town's motto, "The Beehive of Industry", which is still used today.
The town's proximity to rail lines and a large waterfront made Harrison favorably situated for trade. Some of the industries which called Harrison home included the Edison Lamp Works, Worthington Pump and Machinery, the RCA Company, Crucible Steel Company, Otis Elevator, Hartz Mountain, Remco Industries and Hyatt Roller Bearing.
As the U.S. moved into the 20th century, these facilities played a major role in the development of new products for both the private and public sector, peaking during World War II. The small town of about only 14,000 residents had more than 90,000 workers commuting into it on a daily basis. In the 21st century the town is undergoing a transformation from a manufacturing center to a residential and service sector town.


== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 1.33 square miles (3.44 km2), including 1.21 square miles (3.14 km2) of land and 0.12 square miles (0.30 km2) of water (8.72%). Unincorporated communities located partially or completely within Harrison include Manhattan Transfer.
The town borders the municipalities of East Newark and Kearny in Hudson County; and Newark across the Passaic River in Essex County.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===

Harrison is governed under the Town form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 9 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and Town Council, all of whom are elected on a partisan basis as part of the November general elections. A mayor is elected directly by the voters at-large to a four-year term of office. The Town Council includes eight members who are elected to serve four-year terms on a staggered basis, with one seat from each of the town's four wards up for vote one year, one seat from each of the four wards up the next year and then two years with no elections.
The town is divided into four electoral wards, with each ward represented by two council members, with a total of eight council members on the Town Council. Each ward is divided into three districts (except for the 1st Ward, which has two districts), for a total of 11 electoral districts. The head of the government is the mayor. The mayor chairs the Town Council and heads the municipal government. The Mayor may both vote on legislation before the council and veto ordinances. The Mayor's veto can be overruled by ¾ of the Town Council voting to overrule the veto. Town Council meetings are held on the first Tuesday of the month at 7:00 pm (except in July and August, when no meetings are held, at the call of the chairman), in Council Chambers, which is located on the second floor of the Town Hall at 318 Harrison Avenue. Public Caucus Meetings are held at 6:30 pm.
As of 2025, the Mayor of Harrison is Democrat James A. Fife, who is serving a term of office ending December 31, 2022.

Doran (D, 2026; 4th Ward), Jesus Huaranga (D, 2026; 1st Ward), Ellen Mendoza (D, 2026; 2nd Ward), Delfim Sarabando (D, 2027; 3rd Ward) and Eleanor Villalta (D, 2027; 2nd Ward),  with a vacant 4th Ward seat expiring in 2027.
In November 2024, Michael Dolaghan resigned from his 4th Ward seat that expires in 2027. As no one was appointed by council to fill the vacancy, the seat will remain vacant until the November 2025 general election, when the voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term
Harrison had one of the longest-serving mayors in United States history, Frank E. Rodgers, who was first elected in 1946, defeating incumbent Frederick J. Gassert who had served for 16 years, and served for 48 years, from 1947 to 1995, being elected to 24 two-year terms. He also served two terms in the New Jersey State Senate, from 1978 to 1984.
While serving a term scheduled to end on December 31, 2014, longtime Mayor Raymond McDonough died on February 12, 2014, after suffering a heart attack at town hall. Later that month, the town council selected James Fife, a former Harrison High School principal, to complete term of McDonough's seat as mayor, which he had held since 1995.
In 2018, the town had an average property tax bill of $11,109, the highest in the county, compared to an average bill of $8,767 statewide.

=== Police ===
In the 1870s, the township was patrolled by Phillip Mulligan and four constables. In 1878, Mulligan was eventually appointed "Police Justice" and in 1885, an ordinance was passed to regulate and establish a police department. In 1891, the first police officers were appointed under the 1895 ordinance. Michael Rodgers (father of Mayor Frank E. Rodgers) was among those appointed. He eventually became the first chief of police.
On March 28, 1897, Officer John J. Clark was electrocuted while investigating a downed power line, becoming the first Harrison police officer to die in the line of duty. A plaque at police headquarters is dedicated in his memory.
The Harrison Police Department is presently led by Chief of Police David Strumolo, who was sworn in March 2018. The department currently consists of 39 members, down from a one-time high of 67 officers in the 1990s. The department consists of several divisions; Administrative, Patrol, Detective, Traffic Safety, Street Crimes, and Community Policing. The department participates in National Night Out, and various cultural and civic events, as well as "meet and greets."
The department was among the many Hudson County agencies that responded to the January 2009 crash of Flight 1549, for which they received accolades from the survivors.
The Harrison Police Department is recognized as an "accredited police agency" by the New Jersey Law Enforcement Accreditation Commission and the New Jersey Association of Chiefs of Police.


=== Fire ===

The Harrison Fire Department operates out of a fire station located at 634 Sussex Street and operates a fire apparatus fleet of three engines, one ladder, and several support units and spares. Due to cutbacks, the HFD usually is able to staff one engine with three members and one ladder with three members and one tour commander on duty. The HFD has a table of organization of 29 firefighters. In April 2013, officials from neighboring municipalities and fire departments expressed their frustration at the stresses placed on their firefighters in covering fires in Harrison. Currently Harrison is staffing two engines and one ladder 24/7.

== Education ==

The Harrison Public Schools serves students in kindergarten through twelfth grade. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in Abbott v. Burke which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. As of the 2018–19 school year, the district, comprised of four schools, had an enrollment of 2,409 students and 166.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 14.5:1. Schools in the district (with 2018–19 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are Harrison Early Childhood Program (grades Pre-K3 and Pre-K4), Lincoln Elementary School with 620 students in grades Pre-K to 3, Hamilton Intermediate School with 307 students in grades 4–5, Washington Middle School with 438 students in grades 6–8, and Harrison High School with 692 students in grades 9–12.
Holy Cross School of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark operated until 2009, when it merged into Mater Dei Academy in Kearny; the merged school closed in 2012.


== Civic organizations ==
Harrison Lions Club was chartered on July 25, 1951. The Harrison Club is part of Multiple District 16 (New Jersey) which is part of Lions Clubs International (LCI), the world's largest service organization. The club supports and provides financial aid to the district, state, and international sight projects and is also involved in community programs.


== Transportation ==


=== Roads and highways ===

As of May 2010, the town had a total of 18.15 miles (29.21 km) of roadways, of which 15.23 miles (24.51 km) were maintained by the municipality, 1.57 miles (2.53 km) by Hudson County and 1.35 miles (2.17 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.
Interstate 280 runs through the center of the town. Westward, I-280 leads to Route 21, the Garden State Parkway, and Interstate 80. Eastward, it leads to Route 7 and the New Jersey Turnpike.
Replacement of Interstate 280's partial access in central Harrison with service roads, a new interchange, and an overpass (to improve access to Harrison Avenue, the PATH station, and Sports Illustrated Stadium, and to give north–south passage to local street traffic) is in the planning stages.


=== Public transportation ===

The Harrison station on the PATH rapid transit system offers service to Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken and New York City. The station was built in 1913 and relocated to its present location in 1936. A major reconstruction for the Harrison Station was approved on March 28, 2012, and construction started in January 2013. The completion target, originally scheduled for April 2017, was tentatively moved to 2018; the expansion of the station was completed on June 15, 2019.
The Northeast Corridor, built in the 19th century by the Pennsylvania Railroad and now owned by Amtrak, carries NJ Transit trains, and passes through the city on the same alignment as the PATH. There was a stop on the Northeast Corridor in Harrison, but it was eliminated due to the ease of picking up trains in Newark at Penn Station.
Harrison is served by buses operated by several bus companies. NJ Transit offers service within New Jersey on the 30, 40 routes.
The closest airport in New Jersey with scheduled passenger service is Newark Liberty International Airport, located 4.8 miles (7.7 km) away in Newark and Elizabeth.


== Harrison Waterfront Development Plan ==

The Harrison Waterfront Redevelopment Plan invited developers to submit plans that capitalize on the presence of the Harrison PATH Station and the Passaic River within a 275-acre (1.11 km2) area that covers 35% of the whole town. The Plan seeks to unite the developers' proposals with a design theme that includes motifs from Harrison's industrial, cultural, and environmental history as a means of fostering a new identity for Harrison that provides a variety of mixed-use, transit-oriented, pedestrian-scale development that will make Harrison a regional destination.


== Sports Illustrated Stadium ==

Harrison is the location of Sports Illustrated Stadium, home of the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer and Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League. After years of construction delays, the stadium opened on March 20, 2010, with an exhibition game against the Brazilian club Santos FC. The soccer-specific stadium (SSS) was constructed at a cost of $200 million and has a capacity of approximately 25,000, with a natural grass field, featuring a full wavy translucent European-style roof that covers all of the seats in the stadium but not the field. The stadium sits alongside the Passaic River with a view of the New York and Newark skyline, and is accessible via public transportation at the PATH train station in Harrison.
