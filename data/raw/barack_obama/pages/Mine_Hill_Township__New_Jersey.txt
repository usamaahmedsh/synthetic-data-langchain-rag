Mine Hill Township is a township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a residential community located just west of the center of Morris County, and northwest of the county seat Morristown.
Mine Hill was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 2, 1923, from portions of Randolph, based on the results of a referendum held on May 8, 1923.
The township's name comes from the history of mines in the area. Mining in Mine Hill dates back to the early 18th century and the township had some of the richest sources of iron ore in the country. The family of Mahlon Dickerson, who was New Jersey's 7th Governor, owned the Dickerson Mine, which was the largest ore mine in the area, supplying much of the iron ore used during the American Revolutionary War. The last mine in the township closed in the late 1960s.
As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 4,015, an increase of 364 (+10.0%) from the 2010 census count of 3,651, which in turn reflected a decline of 28 (−0.8%) from the 3,679 counted in the 2000 census.
