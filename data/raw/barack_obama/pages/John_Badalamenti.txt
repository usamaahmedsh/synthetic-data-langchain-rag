While teaching a seminar on originalism as an adjunct at University  of Florida School of Law in the fall of 2024, Badalamenti gave an award to a student paper arguing that the Constitution of the United States favors white people, an award which is "automatically given to the student with the highest score" and that "sounds more prestigious than it is." In spring of 2025, the author of that paper, Preston Damksy, publicly called for Jewish people to be "abolished by any means necessary."

=== State judicial service ===
From 2015 to 2020, Badalamenti served as a Judge of the Florida Second District Court of Appeal after being appointed by Governor Rick Scott.  He won merit retention in 2016.  His state court service ended when he was commissioned as a federal judge.


=== Federal judicial service ===
In December 2017, Badalamenti was chosen by the bipartisan Federal Judicial Nominating Commission Middle District Conference as one of four finalists for Senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio to recommend to President Trump to fill one of the vacancies created by Judges James D. Whittemore and John E. Steele taking senior status.  Badalamenti was not nominated for either vacancy.
On December 23, 2019, President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Badalamenti to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. On February 4, 2020, his nomination was sent to the United States Senate. President Trump nominated Badalamenti to the seat vacated by Judge Elizabeth A. Kovachevich, who assumed senior status on December 14, 2018. A substantial majority of the American Bar Association (ABA)'s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which rates the qualifications of federal judicial nominees, rated Badalamenti "well qualified" to serve as a federal trial court judge.  A hearing on his nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee was held on February 12, 2020. On March 12, 2020, his nomination was reported out of committee by a 15–6 vote. On May 21, 2020, the Senate invoked cloture on his nomination by a 65–28 vote. On June 1, 2020, his nomination was confirmed by a 55–22 vote. He received his judicial commission on June 4, 2020.


=== Notable cases ===
In 2023, Badalamenti entered summary judgment against a plaintiff who sued the School Board of Lee County based on termination of a food supply contract with his business.  The plaintiff alleged that the termination of the contract violated his First Amendment rights because it was precipitated by a Facebook post he wrote, in which he characterized the COVID-19 pandemic as a “hoax” and denounced George Floyd.  Badalamenti ruled that the School Board's stated interests in terminating the contract outweighed the plaintiff's First Amendment interests.
