He subsequently relocated to California for two years to work within the trust department of the Los Angeles branch of the Bank of Italy. Burns moved his legal practice to Rock Rapids, Iowa, in 1932.
Burns served as Lyon County attorney from 1935 to 1936, and was elected to a single term on the Iowa House of Representatives between January 13, 1941, and January 10, 1943. He represented District 99 as a Republican. Burns later served a second stint as Lyon County attorney from 1945 to 1946. He died in a Luverne, Minnesota, hospital on October 30, 1983, aged 80.
