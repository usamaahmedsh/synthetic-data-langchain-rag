Seaside Park is a borough in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is part of the New Brunswick–Lakewood, NJ Metropolitan Division, which is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 1,436, a decrease of 143 (−9.1%) from the 2010 census count of 1,579, which in turn had reflected decline of 684 (−30.2%) from the 2,263 counted in the 2000 census. Seaside Park is situated on the Barnegat Peninsula, a long, narrow barrier peninsula that separates Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean.


== History ==
The first inhabitants of the barrier island were Lenape Native Americans who came in search of fish, crabs, clams, and scallops. They called this area "Seheyichbi," meaning land bordering the ocean. The Atlantic Ocean provided more than food; these people began using shells in place of wooden beads as their form of currency. These Native Americans, who stayed during the summer and went inland for winter, were part of the principal Algonquian tribe that lived mainly on and around the North American Seaboard. The Algonquians in New Jersey called themselves "Lenni Lenape", which means "original people."

What is now Seaside Park was a section of Dover Township (now known as Toms River Township) until the creation of Berkeley Township in 1875. The area then became known as the Sea Side Park section of Berkeley Township. Over the next 25 years, lots were sold, houses and roads were built, and the population of Seaside Park began to grow.
On March 3, 1898, New Jersey Senate President Foster M. Voorhees, the acting governor of New Jersey, signed a bill incorporating "Sea Side Park" as an independent borough, created from portions of Berkeley Township. Originally, the town ran from 14th Avenue to North Avenue, about half its present size. An area known as the Berkeley Tract, north of the original area of the borough, was annexed on or about May 12, 1900. The borough was named for its location on the Atlantic Ocean.
As the community grew, the name of the borough lost a space. In 1914, a newly appointed municipal clerk wrote the name of the borough as "Seaside Park" in the council minutes, combining the first two words. This practice continues to this day.
While Sea Side Park was going through the process of being incorporated, the Senate Amusement Company of Philadelphia was working on plans to build an oceanside attraction in Seaside Heights within feet of the border to Sea Side Park. Their plan was to build a covered pier to house a carousel. The structure was built in 1915 under the direction of Joseph Vanderslice of Senate Amusement Company. Budget issues caused the business to not open in 1916, and the amusement ride and building was subsequently sold to Frank Freeman. The combination of the completion of the Toms River Bridge on October 23, 1914, and the DuPont Avenue carousel and boardwalk are what likely led to the 219% population growth shown between the 1910 and 1920 censuses in Sea Side Park.
In September 2014 residents of the South Seaside Park neighborhood of Berkeley Township submitted a petition to move from the township and become a part of Seaside Park borough, arguing that the neighborhood was 16 miles (26 km) away from the township's municipal offices and that there were minimal social connections with the rest of Berkeley Township. In 2025, the New Jersey Supreme Court approved the petition and agreed that South Seaside Park may leave the township and join Seaside Park borough.


=== Disasters ===
On June 9, 1955, a malfunctioning neon sign component caused a fire at a shop on the corner of Ocean Terrace and DuPont Avenue. The fire was driven by winds estimated at 50 miles per hour (80 km/h), blowing the fire south and engulfing the entire pier. The fire was stopped at Stockton Avenue due in part to the fact that the boardwalk and pier ended there. In what became known as Freeman's Fire, a total of 85 buildings were destroyed with an estimated $4 million in damage from the conflagration.
On March 8, 1962, Seaside Park was affected by a nor'easter that had churned offshore for two days. The storm, which destroyed a large section of the borough's boardwalk, is variously referred to as the Ash Wednesday Storm, the Five High Storm and the Great March Storm of 1962.
On September 12, 2013, a ten-alarm fire swept from the Funtown Pier northward. The fire is believed to have started under the boardwalk, below the Kohr's Kustard stand at the southern end of the pier. The wind pushed it northward, and fire crews were able to make a stand at Lincoln Avenue by tearing up the newly replaced boardwalk which was destroyed less than a year before by Hurricane Sandy. Jack & Bill's Bar and Kohr's Kustard were two businesses that were destroyed in both the 1955 and 2013 fires.
On September 17, 2016, a suspected pipe bomb was placed in a trashcan and detonated, causing a small explosion, but no injuries or deaths. It is currently unclear who placed the bomb and under what motivation, but it is believed the bomb's intended target was the Seaside Semper Five, a 5K run taking place in the surrounding area. The run had been delayed due to unforeseen circumstances regardless, but was canceled soon after details of the explosion became clear.

The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Seaside Park is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

== Education ==
After the Seaside Park School District, which had served public school students in kindergarten through sixth grade, closed its school in 2010, a sending/receiving relationship was established with the Toms River Regional Schools for Seaside Park students in grades K–6.
In 2015, the Seaside Park district submitted a petition to the New Jersey Department of Education to allow Seaside Park to establish a second send / receive relationship with the Lavallette School District, under which Seaside Park students would have the choice of attending K–6 school in either Toms River or Lavallette. A number of students from Seaside Park had already been attending Lavallete Elementary School, including four of the five board of education members who voted in favor of the petition. The Lavallete district actively supported the proposal and the Toms River Schools had posed no objection when Seaside Park had originally submitted the petition. In 2017, the Appellate Division affirmed a decision by the commissioner of education to allow Seaside Park to establish the dual send / receive relationship with the Lavallette district, rejecting the claims made by the Toms River Schools and noting the fact that the district had posed no objection when Seaside Park had submitted a petition to advance the proposal in 2015.
Students in public school for seventh through twelfth grades attend the schools of the Central Regional School District, which also serves students from the municipalities of Berkeley Township, Island Heights, Ocean Gate and Seaside Heights. Schools in the district (with 2017–2018 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Central Regional Middle School for grades 7 and 8 (761 students) and

Seaside Park is allocated one of the board's nine seats.
