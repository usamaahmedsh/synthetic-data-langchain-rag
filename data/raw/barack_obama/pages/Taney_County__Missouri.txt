Taney County is a county in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Missouri. As of the 2020 census, the population was 56,066. Its county seat is Forsyth. It is included in the Branson Micropolitan Statistical Area.
Taney County was officially organized on January 4, 1837, and named in honor of Roger Brooke Taney, the fifth Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, best known for delivering the infamous majority opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford. However, unlike Roger B. Taney, who pronounced his name /ˈtɔːni/, the "Taney" in Taney County is generally pronounced /ˈteɪni/.
The county includes the popular tourist destinations Branson and Table Rock, Taneycomo and Bull Shoals lakes.


== History ==
The first Taney County Courthouse was built on the mouth of Bull Creek at the confluence of the White River by early pioneers in 1837. Its use as a courthouse ended after Forsyth became the county seat; it was destroyed in a tornado in 1963.
The county's second courthouse, in Forsyth, was destroyed in a Civil War battle on July 22, 1861. The rebuilt courthouse was destroyed by fire on December 19, 1885. A third courthouse was removed in 1952 to permit the building of Bull Shoals Lake. The fourth, and present, courthouse was occupied on August 1, 1952. An addition was completed in 1991 after two years of construction.


=== Bald Knobbers ===
In the years following the Civil War, Taney County experienced ongoing violence and weak official authority. In response, a group of 13 local men led by Union veteran Nat Kinney formed a vigilante organization known as the Bald Knobbers on April 5, 1885, near Kirbyville, Missouri. The group took its name from their meeting location on a treeless hilltop known as Snapp's Bald.
The Bald Knobbers were organized not to uphold equal justice, but to impose their own strict and often violent values on the community. Claiming to oppose crime, they often targeted individuals who simply did not conform to their moral or political views. As their influence grew, their actions became more extreme—ranging from intimidation and public beatings to acts of deadly violence.
The group’s tactics soon provoked backlash. Opposing factions, sometimes called the Anti-Bald Knobbers, formed in resistance. Tensions escalated into deadly confrontations, including the assassination of Kinney in 1888 and the 1889 public execution of several Bald Knobbers who had committed murder. 
The Bald Knobbers left a controversial legacy, seen remembered by many as enforcers of fear who used violence to shape society according to their own ideals. Their story inspired literature and folklore, including Harold Bell Wright’s novel The Shepherd of the Hills and local Ozarks tourism attractions.
In 1904, the White River Railway was extended through the rugged terrain of Stone and Taney counties. By then, both counties had for years had a sundown town policy, forbidding African Americans to live there.
In 2008, a New Taney County Judicial Center was built. That Judicial Center houses the courtrooms, the Circuit Clerk, and the County Jail.

==== Political culture ====

Taney County is a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. George W. Bush carried Taney County in 2000 and 2004 by more than two-to-one margins. Taney County strongly favored John McCain over Barack Obama in 2008. The last time the Republican Party failed to carry Taney County was in 1860.
Like most rural areas throughout the Bible Belt in Southwest Missouri, voters in Taney County traditionally adhere to socially and culturally conservative principles which tend to strongly influence their Republican leanings. In 2004, Missourians voted on a constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union between a man and a woman. It passed Taney County with 80.04 percent of the vote, and the state in general with 71 percent of support from voters, making Missouri the first state to ban same-sex marriage. In 2006, Missourians voted on a constitutional amendment to fund and legalize embryonic stem cell research in the state—it failed in Taney County with 56.64 percent voting against the measure. The initiative narrowly passed the state with 51 percent of support from voters as Missouri became one of the first states in the nation to approve embryonic stem cell research. Despite Taney County's longstanding tradition of supporting socially conservative platforms, voters in the county have a penchant for advancing populist causes like increasing the minimum wage. In 2006, Missourians voted on a proposition (Proposition B) to increase the minimum wage in the state to $6.50 an hour—it passed Taney County with 77.78 percent of the vote. The proposition strongly passed every single county in Missouri with 78.99 percent voting in favor as the minimum wage was increased to $6.50 an hour in the state. During the same election, voters in five other states also strongly approved increases in the minimum wage.
