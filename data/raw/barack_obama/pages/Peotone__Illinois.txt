Peotone Elementary School (PES), located in town Peotone, serves kindergarten through 3rd grade. Peotone Intermediate Center (PIC), formerly Green Garden Elementary School in Green Garden Township, serves 4th and 5th grades. The Connor Shaw Center is home to the district offices and the Pre-K Center.
Peotone Junior High School serves grades six through eight, and has been located in the former Peotone Junior Senior High School building since the 2001–2002 school year; the high school continues to use some of the outdoor sports facilities at the junior high. Several referendums have been orchestrated to build a new sports complex at the new high school, but have failed; these have also included plans to build on to the existing high school and junior high in order to resolve overcrowding.
In 2001, a new high school was built on the northwest side of Peotone. It's named Peotone High School While the school was designed for a capacity of 600 students, its student enrollment for the 2010-2011 fiscal year was approximately 687.

In 2014, the Peotone School Board, in a 4–3 vote, decided to close the Wilton Center Elementary School in Wilton Township.  The remaining elementary schools were reformatted to grade centers.


== Proposed south suburban airport ==

Peotone has long been the proposed site of a new airport to serve the Chicago area. As is often the case with the construction of airports, the proposal is controversial. In 1967, the Chicago Tribune ran several editorials regarding the need for a third airport in Peotone.
Proponents point out that the existing facilities at O'Hare and Midway airports cannot meet the transportation needs of the Chicago area, and that the development will bring economic prosperity to Chicago Southland, an area deprived of economic development, as well as the rest of the state. Politicians backing plans include former Governor Rod Blagojevich; former Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., Congressman Jerry Weller, the former representative of the district in which the airport would be located, and Will County Executive Larry Walsh.  The efforts were also supported by then-state senator Barack Obama.
Opponents to the plan are concerned about the environmental disruption that would be caused by new airport construction and the roads that would be needed to support it. They also point out that Gary/Chicago International Airport in Gary, Indiana already exists, is closer to Chicago than Peotone, and is already undergoing expansion to support heavier use with minimal environmental impact. Politicians opposing the Peotone airport plan include former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, former Gary Mayor Scott King, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, and Representative Pete Visclosky from Indiana.
Former Representative Jesse Jackson, jr. was the head of a private group in Cook County looking to take ownership of the proposed airport. A state-backed IDOT plan is more friendly to the citizens of the actual footprint of the proposed airport by giving local control of the airport to Will County officials instead.
In the science-fiction novel The Boy Who Would Live Forever (2004), which was the fifth in the Gateway series, Frederik Pohl has a character fly out of "Peotone International Airport". The late Pohl lived in Palatine, Illinois.
