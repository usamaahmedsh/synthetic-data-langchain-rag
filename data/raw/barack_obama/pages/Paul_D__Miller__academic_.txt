== Career ==
Dr. Miller served as Director for Afghanistan on the National Security Council staff from September 2007 to September 2009 under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.  Miller served on the staff of Douglas Lute, who served as Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan for President Bush and, subsequently, as Special Coordinator for Afghanistan and Pakistan for President Obama.  Miller supported the presidential transition and continued in his position during the Obama Administration before accepting a position as assistant professor of International Security Affairs at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.


=== Views on Afghanistan ===
Miller writes regularly about U.S. policy towards Afghanistan, Pakistan, and South Asia.  He has argued that "The greatest threat to long-term success in Afghanistan is not the Taliban, who are fairly weak compared to other insurgent movements around the world. It is the Afghan government’s endemic weakness and the international community’s failure to address it."  Miller's proposed solution is greater attention to reconstruction and stabilization in Afghanistan.  He has criticized the views of conservatives, like George Will, as well as moderates and liberals, like David Rothkopf, who argue the war effort in Afghanistan is unwinnable for the U.S.
