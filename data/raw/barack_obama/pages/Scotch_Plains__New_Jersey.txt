== History ==


=== Native settlement ===
The Lenape are the ancestral community indigenous to a large chunk of the Mid-Atlantic region, stretching from Eastern Pennsylvania to the Atlantic Ocean, and from Delaware to Southern New York. Scotch Plains and the Mid-Atlantic region was used by the Lenape and their ancestors for roughly 10,000 years. It is suggested that the Lenape used Scotch Plains as a temporary camp in between the highly-utilized Delaware River and mountains to the West, and the Atlantic Ocean to the East.


=== Chronology and Ways of life ===
From the earliest periods of the Paleo-Indian (10,000-12,000 years ago) to the Archaic Period (4,000-10,000 years ago), there is evidence suggesting a high degree of mobile hunting in the rivers and woods around the Scotch Plains area, with spears, atlatls, and axe heads being found. During the Woodland period (450-4,000 years ago), it was common for communities to make items such as dugout canoes and nets for fishing, two artifacts the Lenape have come to be known for, along with their shelter of choice, the wigwam. During this time they also extensively farmed, moving around to different areas in search of productive land as the seasons progressed.


=== Colonial era ===
The area known as Scotch Plains was first settled by Europeans, including many Scottish Quakers, as early as 1684. The name is said to have come from George Scott, a leader of a group of Scottish settlers. It later served as a stop on the stage coach line between New York City and Philadelphia.
The Lenni Lenape were significantly impacted by the establishment of colonies in the 17th century, with colonists taking up a large majority of land that had once been the living area of the community. In 1778, the US ratified the first treaty with an American Indian tribe, the Treaty of Fort Pitt; the treaty eventually fell apart, causing the inter-cultural relationship to rupture. Today, the Lenni-Lenape, now known as the Delaware Nation, are found in small regions across the US and Canada. A variety of treaties, conflicts, and migration have spread out the community, although a small group continue to live in their ancestral region, hoping to educate and bring to light their claims to the land, including Scotch Plains.
The Ash Swamp in Scotch Plains was the scene of a key action in the Battle of Short Hills, on June 26, 1777, which included skirmishes as Washington's forces moved along Rahway Road in Scotch Plains toward the Watchung Mountains. The Frazee House in Scotch Plains recalls those skirmishes and, with the acreage adjoining the house, presents a snapshot of the 1770s. This was the home of Aunt Betty Frazee, whose retort to Lord Cornwallis led the British to find their bread from friendlier bakers in the same battle. The farmstead of Betty and Gershom Frazee is being restored by local organizations.
What is now Scotch Plains was originally incorporated as Fanwood Township on March 6, 1878, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of Plainfield Township and Westfield Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Fanwood Borough on October 2, 1895. Fanwood Township was renamed as Scotch Plains on March 29, 1917, based on the results of a referendum held that same day.
Scotch Plains was home to the Shady Rest Golf and Country Club, the nation's first African-American country club. Its pro, John Shippen, the first African-American golf professional, led the 1892 U.S. Open in the final round before finishing fifth. The Shady Rest clubhouse hosted Cab Calloway and other greats as a local center for African-American culture in the 1920s and 1930s. It is preserved today as the Scotch Hills Municipal course.
A much more complete history of the township can be found in the October 28, 1999, "Our Towns: Scotch Plains-Fanwood (2nd Annual)" issue of The Times of Scotch Plains-Fanwood, produced by the town's newspaper of record at the time as well as on the township's website.
The ancestors of many residents immigrated from the area of Montazzoli, Italy, as part of a wave of Italian immigrants who arrived in the area in the early 20th century. In recognition of this longstanding connection, the township established "Montazzoli Plaza" in October 2015 in front of the Italian American Club.

The Aunt Betty Frazee House is a farmhouse of a colonial-era couple Gershom and Elizabeth Frazee, the latter of whom was approached by British generals in 1777 who sought to buy bread she'd been baking that day. Aunt Betty's famous retort ("I offer this bread not in love but in fear"—whereupon the generals courteously abandoned their effort to buy) puts her in company with Betsy Ross, Molly Pitcher and other women who distinguished themselves in the American Revolution. Her house is on state and national historic registers, and many in the community are seeking a way of restoring the house (at 1451 Raritan Road) to honor Betty's story and secure it in American history.
