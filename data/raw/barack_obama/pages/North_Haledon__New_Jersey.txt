== Government ==


=== Local government ===
North Haledon is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by North Haledon is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2023, the mayor of North Haledon is Republican Randolph J. "Randy" George, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2026. Members of the North Haledon Borough Council are Council President Bruce O. Iacobelli (R, 2025), Rocco Luisi (R, 2023), Vince Parmese (R, 2025), George Pomianek (R, 2024), Donna Puglisi (R, 2024), and Jacqueline Roscio (R, 2023).
In December 2019, Sandra Salviano was selected from a list of three candidates nominated by the municipal committee to fill the term expiring in December 2022 that had been become vacant following the death earlier that month of her husband, Keith Salviano. Sandra Salviano served on an interim basis until the November 2020 general election, when she was elected to serve the balance of the term of office, though she stepped down from office in February 2021 and was replaced by Vince Parmese, who was elected in November 2021 to serve the remainder of the term.
In 2013, Mayor Randy George was criticized by residents for his use of two borough-owned generators in the persistent electric outages during the days following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy to provide power to the refrigerators in his ice cream store, while Police Chief Robert Bracco had used another municipal-owned generator to provide power at his home. A special committee formed of borough council members found that the actions were justifiable in light of the circumstances and enabled them to serve the borough during the emergency, but recommended that rules be established to govern personal use of borough property by municipal employees and officials.
