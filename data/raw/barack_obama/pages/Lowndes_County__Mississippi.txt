Lowndes County is a county on the eastern border of the U.S. state of Mississippi. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 58,879. Its county seat is Columbus. The county is named for U.S. Congressman William Jones Lowndes.
Lowndes County comprises the Columbus, MS Micropolitan Statistical Area. Since the late 20th century, it has been designated as one of three counties in the Golden Triangle region of the state.


== History ==
This upland area was settled by European Americans who wanted to develop cotton plantations to produce what became the largest commodity crop in the state.
In the period from 1877 to 1950, Lowndes County had 19 documented lynchings of African Americans, third to Carroll and Leflore counties, which had 29 and 48, respectively. This form of racial terrorism was at its height in the decades around the turn of the 20th century, which followed the state's disenfranchisement of most blacks in 1890 through creating barriers to voter registration.


== Geography ==
Lowndes County lies on the east side of Mississippi, bordering the U.S. state of Alabama. Its terrain was completely wooded before settlement; at present its more level areas have been cleared and turned to agricultural or urban use, with the drainages (about 40% of the total area) still wooded. The Tennessee−Tombigbee Waterway flows south-southeastward through the center of the county, with a significant lock system (John C. Stennis Lock and Dam) near Columbus.
The county's highest point (450 feet/140 meters ASL) is a small rise near the county's NE corner.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 516 square miles (1,340 km2), of which 506 square miles (1,310 km2) is land and 11 square miles (28 km2) (2.1%) is water.

Lowndes County leans Republican, having not supported a Democrat since 1956. However, in 2008 Democrat Barack Obama came the closest to winning the county since Adlai Stevenson had won it in 1956, and in 2012 Obama came even closer, only losing it by 130 votes. While the margin has widened again in subsequent elections, Republican candidates have been unable to regain double digit victories in the county.
