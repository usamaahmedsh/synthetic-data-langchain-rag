== History ==
The area now known as Tabernacle was originally inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans. In 1778, John Brainerd established a Christian church called "Tabernacle in the Wilderness," with the aim of converting the local Native American population to Christianity. In 1803, William Wilkins sold land to 28 individuals for the creation of Tabernacle Cemetery, which was located adjacent to the church.
The church also served as a schoolhouse, but as the community expanded, a one-room schoolhouse was built in 1856 at the future location of Tabernacle Town Hall. A sawmill was constructed in the Friendship area in the early 1700s, and around 1860, Gilbert Knight built the Knight-Pepper House near the Town Hall. The property subsequently passed to the Scott and Pepper families, and upon the death of Clara Pepper in 1987, it was donated to the Tabernacle Historic Society. In the 1880s, the Tabernacle Methodist Episcopal Church was constructed on the original site, where it still stands today.
Tabernacle became an incorporated township on March 22, 1901, through an act of the New Jersey Legislature, incorporating portions of Shamong Township, Southampton Township, and Woodland Township.
On July 13, 1928, Emilio Carranza, known as the "Lindbergh of Mexico," tragically crashed in Tabernacle during a storm while flying from New York City to Mexico. The Carranza Memorial was erected in his memory, funded by Mexican schoolchildren, and Hampton Gates Road was subsequently renamed Carranza Road in his honor.
In 1909, the one-room schoolhouse was demolished and replaced by a two-room schoolhouse; it was relocated down the road in 1936, and two additional rooms were added. In the 1950s, the Tabernacle Elementary School was constructed on New Road, and Olson Middle School (previously Tabernacle Middle School) was built across the road in 1968. Following the death of Kenneth R. Olson in 1990, the Tabernacle School District renamed the school in his honor. In 2003, Seneca High School was established to serve high school students from Tabernacle, Shamong, Southampton, and Woodland Townships.
In 1970, the population of Tabernacle was 2,103. By 1980, the population had nearly tripled to 6,236, reflecting the rapid suburbanization of the Delaware Valley in South Jersey. The population peaked at 7,362 in 1990, but has been gradually decreasing since then, with 7,170 residents recorded in 2000, and 6,949 in the 2010 census.
