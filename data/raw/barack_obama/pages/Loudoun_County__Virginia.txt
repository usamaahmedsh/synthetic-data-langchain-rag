== History ==


=== 18th century ===

Loudoun County was established in 1757 from Fairfax County. The county is named for John Campbell, Fourth Earl of Loudoun and governor general of Virginia from 1756 to 1759. Western settlement began in the 1720s and 1730s with Quakers, Scots-Irish, Germans and others moving south from Pennsylvania and Maryland, and also by English and enslaved Africans moving upriver from Tidewater.
At the time of the American Revolution, Loudoun County was Virginia's most populous county. It was also rich in agriculture, and the county's contributions of grain to George Washington's Continental Army earned it the nickname "Breadbasket of the Revolution."


=== 19th century ===


==== War of 1812 ====
During the War of 1812, important federal documents and government archives were evacuated from Washington and stored at Leesburg. Local tradition holds that these documents were stored at Rokeby House.
U.S. president James Monroe treated Oak Hill Plantation as a primary residence from 1823 until his death on July 4, 1831. The Loudoun County coat of arms and flag, granted by the English College of Arms, memorialize the special relationship between Britain and the United States that developed through his Monroe Doctrine.


==== American Civil War ====

The American Civil War divided the county, which saw fighting because of its strategic location. In April 1861, both of Loudoun County's representatives to the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 favored the Union. Delegates elected John Janney, a former Quaker and slave owner, presided over that assembly, which ultimately voted to secede. Loudoun voters also voted to secede. In addition to Confederate cavalry and infantry units formed within the county, other Loudoun residents traveled to Maryland to join Union army cavalry and border guard units. On October 21, 1861, in the Battle of Ball's Bluff along the Potomac River near Leesburg, future jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. was critically wounded.
In the spring of 1862, Leesburg was occupied by Union troops and later recaptured by the Confederate Army after Union troops withdrew. Confederate partisan John S. Mosby based his operations in Loudoun and adjoining Fauquier County.  
In June 1863, during the Gettysburg campaign, Confederate major general J.E.B. Stuart and Union cavalry clashed in the battles of Aldie, Middleburg, and Upperville. By December 1863, Loudoun was held by Union forces, and was among the nine counties which elected delegates to the Virginia General Assembly at Alexandria. 
Loudoun voters elected and reelected John J. Henshaw and J. Madison Downey as their representatives to that body, and fellow delegates elected Downey as their Speaker. Loudoun voters elected and reelected William F. Mercer to the upper body of that version of the Virginia General Assembly, and elected him to the Virginia Senate in the 1865–1867 session. They elected former delegates R.M. Bentley and William Hill Gray as their part-time delegates in the lower house in that session.


=== 20th century ===
During World War I, Loudoun County was a major breadbasket for supplying provisions to soldiers in Europe. Loudoun farmers implemented new agricultural innovations such as vaccination of livestock, seed inoculations and ensilage. The county experienced a boom in agricultural output, outputting an annual wheat output of 1.04 million bushels in 1917, the largest of any county in Virginia that year. 1.2 million units of home produce were produced at home, much of which went to training sites across the state such as Camp Lee. The Smith–Lever Act of 1914 established increased agricultural education in Virginia counties, increasing agricultural yields. After the war, a plaque was dedicated to the "30 glorious dead" from the county who died in the Great War. Five of the thirty died on the front, while the other twenty five died while in training or in other locations inside the United States.
In 1962, Dulles International Airport was built in southeastern Loudoun County in Sterling. Since then, Loudoun County has experienced a high-tech boom and rapid growth. Accordingly, many have moved to eastern Loudoun and become residents of planned communities such as Sterling Park, Sugarland Run, Cascades, Ashburn Village, and Ashburn Farm, making that section a veritable part of the Washington suburbs. Others have moved to the county seat or to the small towns and rural communities of the Loudoun Valley, which makes up the majority of the county's area.


== Geography ==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Loudoun County has a total area of 521 square miles (1,350 km2), of which 516 square miles (1,340 km2) is land and 6 square miles (16 km2) (1.1%) is water. It is bounded on the north by the Potomac River; across the river are Frederick, Washington and Montgomery counties in Maryland; it is bounded on the south by Prince William and Fauquier counties, on the west by the watershed of the Blue Ridge Mountain across which are Jefferson County, West Virginia and Clarke County, and on the east by Fairfax County. The Bull Run Mountains and Catoctin Mountain bisect the county. To the west of the range is the Loudoun Valley. Bisecting the Loudoun Valley from Hillsboro to the Potomac River is Short Hill Mountain.

== Demographics ==

From 1890 to 1940, the county had a decline in population as people moved to cities for more opportunities. The decline was likely highest among African Americans, who had worked in an agricultural economy that was becoming increasingly mechanized. During the first half of the 20th century, African Americans moved out of rural areas to cities in the Great Migration. In the 21st century, African Americans now form a proportionally much smaller portion of the county's population than they once did, and the Hispanic and Asian populations of the county outnumber them significantly.

== Government and politics ==

Between 1952 and 2008, Loudoun was a Republican-leaning county. 
However, this has changed in recent years with Democrats winning Loudoun in all statewide campaigns after Republicans narrowly carried it in 2014. As of the 2023 elections, Democrats hold a seven to two majority on the Board of Supervisors and a six to three majority on the School Board, but Republicans hold all five countywide elected constitutional offices (Clerk of the Circuit Court, Commissioner of the Revenue, Commonwealth's Attorney, Sheriff, 
and Treasurer). This makes Loudoun County a reliable state bellwether, having voted for every statewide presidential election winner since 1932.
The county's official motto, I Byde My Time, is borrowed from the coat of arms of the Earl of Loudoun. In the mid to late 20th century, as northerners gradually migrated to Southern suburbs, Loudoun County increasingly shifted to the Republican Party in supporting presidential candidates, and more local ones. Before the 2008 election of Barack Obama, county voters had not supported a Democratic president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.
In recent years, the county's rapid suburban growth in its eastern portion, settled by educated professionals working in or near Washington, D.C., has changed the demographics of the county, and the Democratic Party has become increasingly competitive. After giving Senator Barack Obama nearly 54% of its presidential vote in 2008, the county supported Republican Bob McDonnell in 2009, who received 61% of the gubernatorial vote. Voters also replaced two incumbent Democratic delegates, making Loudoun's state House delegation all Republican. In 2012 county voters again supported Obama, who took 51.5% of the vote, with Republican challenger Mitt Romney garnering 47%. Democrats have won the county in every presidential election since 2008.
In 2020, Joe Biden won 61.5% of the county's vote, the best result for a Democratic candidate in Loudoun since 1964. A year later, in the 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election, Democratic nominee and former Governor Terry McAuliffe won the county with 55.3% to now Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin's 44.2%. Loudoun was one of ten counties that was won by McAuliffe, though it was his smallest margin of victory in Northern Virginia. In 2024, Kamala Harris won 56% to Donald Trump's 40%, with the county shifting right by 9 percentage points from 2020 to 2024.


=== County Board of Supervisors ===
Like many counties in Virginia, Loudoun is locally governed by a board of supervisors, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors. The chairman of the board is elected by county voters at-large while the remaining supervisors are elected from eight single-member districts roughly equal in population. All nine members serve concurrent terms of four years. The board handles policy and land use issues and sets the budget; it appoints a county administrator to handle the county government's day-to-day operations. As of the 2023 elections, the chairman of the board and six district supervisors are Democrats; the remaining two supervisors are Republicans.
The Board's current Chair, Phyllis Randall, became the first person of color in Virginia's history to be an elected chair of a county board when she was elected Chair-at-Large in 2015.
In November 2019, Democrats took over the Board of Supervisors. Voters elected Juli E. Briskman (D) in Algonkian District, with 6,763 votes (54.09%) replacing incumbent Suzanne M. Volpe (R) who polled 5,719 votes (45.74%). Juli Briskman had been fired from her job as a marketing analyst for a United States government and military subcontractor, after an AFP photo of her flipping off the motorcade of Donald Trump went viral on social media in 2017.

The National Transportation Safety Board operates the Ashburn Aviation Field Office in Ashburn, an unincorporated area of Loudoun County. The Federal Aviation Administration's Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center, the second-busiest facility of its kind in the nation, is located in Leesburg.
Emergency services are provided by the Loudoun County Combined Fire and Rescue System with the Office of Emergency Management. LC-CFRS is a combination system that utilizes some 500 volunteers and over 600 career firefighters, EMT/paramedics, dispatchers, and support staff. LCFR is one of the largest fire and rescue systems in Virginia.
Law enforcement in Loudoun County is provided by the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, which is Virginia's largest sheriff's office, as well as three town police departments: Leesburg Police, Purcellville Police, and Middleburg Police. The county's highways are also patrolled by Virginia State Police troopers. Dulles Airport and the Dulles Toll Road are patrolled by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department.
The Loudoun County Public Library System has eleven branches in the county. The library's Outreach Department of the Loudoun County Public Library is a resource for those who cannot easily access branch services. The public library system has won several awards, including 10th place for libraries serving a comparably sized population in 2006
