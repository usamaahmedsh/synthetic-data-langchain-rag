== History ==
What is now North Wildwood City was originally incorporated as the borough of Anglesea on June 13, 1885, from portions of Middle Township, based on the results of a referendum held 11 days earlier. The borough was reincorporated on March 6, 1896, and again on May 4, 1897. On May 16, 1906, the Borough of North Wildwood was incorporated, replacing Anglesea Borough.
Legislation passed in April 1908 established a potential consolidation of North Wildwood and Holly Beach City into Wildwood, subject to approval of referendums in each of the three municipalities, though this merger never took effect.
On April 30, 1917, the area was reincorporated as the City of North Wildwood, in turn replacing North Wildwood borough. The city's name comes from Wildwood, which in turn was named for the area's wild flowers.
In November 2016, more than 60% of voters rejected a non-binding referendum that would ask to change the name of the city from North Wildwood to its historic name of Anglesea. Opponents cited the confusion that would be created and the impact on commerce.
