== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Clayton is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 of New Jersey's 564 municipalities, making it the state's most common form of government. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Clayton is a weak mayor/strong council government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
In March 2019, the borough council selected Christina Moorhouse from three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat vacated by Vonzora Jackson's resignation.
As of 2024, the mayor is Democrat Thomas Bianco, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2027. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Tony Saban (D, 2025), Dave Chapes (D, 2027), Christina Moorhouse (D, 2025), Frank Rollo (D, 2027), Charles Simon (D, 2026) and Darlene Vondran (D, 2026).
Clayton describes itself in its motto as "a great place to live and play, work and pray." The seal, which has been used since the late 1960s, features an image of a factory, a house, a figure fishing off a boat, and with a church with a cross, which was challenged by the Freedom From Religion Foundation in March 2016 as "unmistakably religious" and unconstitutional.
