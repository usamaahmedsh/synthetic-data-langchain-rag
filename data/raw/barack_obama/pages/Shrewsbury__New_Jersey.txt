== History ==

Shrewsbury was part of the Navesink Patent or Monmouth Tract granted soon after the creation of East Jersey in 1665. The tract included Shrewsbury, along with the other historic communities of Freehold Township in western Monmouth County and Middletown Township in northern Monmouth County.
When it was formed in 1693, Shrewsbury covered an area of almost 1,000 square miles (2,600 km2), extending to the north to the Navesink River, south to include all of present-day Ocean County, east to the Atlantic Ocean and west to the present-day border of Monmouth County. It retained its size and scope until 1750, when various different municipalities began to break off from it. The first of those being Stafford Township, which was formed in 1750 and taking away much of modern-day Ocean County. The Parker Homestead, one of the oldest structures in the state, was built by early settlers to the region. Many of the early settlers of the region originated from Long Island, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.
What is now Shrewsbury Township was originally formed on October 31, 1693, and was created as a township by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Shrewsbury Borough broke off from Shrewsbury Township, and was officially established on May 11, 1926.

=== Local government ===
Shrewsbury is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is composed of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Shrewsbury is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2025, the mayor of Shrewsbury Borough is Republican Kimberly Eulner, who was appointed to serve a term of office ending December 31, 2026. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Donald J. Eddy (R, 2027), James Daly (R, 2026), Deidre M. DerAsadourian (R, 2025), Brendan Gilmartin (R, 2026), Daniel Levy (R, 2027) and Jason Sena (R, 2025).
In January 2024, Kimberly Eulner was sworn in as mayor for the team ending December 2026 that became vacant after mayor Erik Anderson stepped down to take office on the Monmouth County Board of County Commissioners. Eulner will serve on an interim basis until the November 2024 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the two years remaining on Anderson's term of office.
The borough council appointed Jaclyn Woehnker in February 2022 to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Kimberly Eulner until she stepped down from office in December 2021 to take office in the New Jersey General Assembly. Woehnker will serve on an interim basis until the November 2022 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the remainder of the term of office.
In February 2016, the borough council selected Erik Anderson to fill the seat expiring in December 2017 that had been held by William E. Dodge until his resignation earlier that month.
