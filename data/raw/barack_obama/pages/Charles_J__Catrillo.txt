Charles J. Catrillo (August 13, 1945 – February 19, 2004) was an American Republican Party politician who served in the New Jersey General Assembly from the 32nd Legislative District from 1986 to 1988.
Born in Jersey City on August 13th, 1945, Catrillo graduated from St. Peter's Preparatory School, and went on to receive degrees from Seton Hall University and Seton Hall University School of Law. 
Charles Catrillo was born to Lillian Statile and Carmine Catrillo in Jersey City right before World War II ended. He was of full Italian descent, with his grandparents immigrating from the Campania and Basilicata regions in the early 1900s. Catrillo was a devout Catholic and was married to Diane Plotkin in October 1973, and their daughter Elizabeth was born in 1977.  
As the Assembly considered a bill that would allow the state to takeover school districts, Catrillo argued that the Jersey City Public Schools, which he cited as a "patronage mill" that poorly serves handicapped students, should be among the first to be taken over.
He not only served in the state legislature but was also the director of water for Jersey City from 1982 until he died in 2004. He was also a judge on the Hudson County Superior Court after ten years as a lawyer and serving as an adjunct professor at Jersey City State College for nearly a decade. He is cousins with former Jersey City politician Guy Catrillo and his sister, Maryann Hammer, was assistant superintendent of the Jersey City Public Schools for a decade after serving as principal of P.S. 28. 
Catrillo suffered from a massive heart attack on February 19, 2004, at his home, and was pronounced dead at the scene at the age of 57. He left behind a large Republican legacy in Hudson County, a known Democrat stronghold, and in winning the state assembly election as a member of the GOP, he proved that it could be done, winning big even in blue cities.
