Whitesides went on to attend Princeton University, where he studied at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, earning his bachelor's degree in 1996.

Whitesides began his career in the space sector, where he served as executive director of the National Space Society from 2004 to 2008. He also co-founded Yuri's Night, an annual celebration of human spaceflight, alongside his wife Loretta Hidalgo Whitesides. During this period, he was named senior advisor to Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's space tourism company.

=== 2024 election ===

On February 22, 2023, Whitesides announced he was running for California's 27th congressional district in the 2024 election as a Democrat, challenging incumbent Republican congressman Mike Garcia. As a first-time candidate without a legislative voting record, Republican opposition focused on the progressive groups and candidates that contributed to his campaign, including Equality California, which co-sponsored the controversial 2020 California Senate Bill 145 regarding judicial discretion in sex offender registration.
Whitesides narrowly defeated Garcia in the general election on November 5, 2024, by around 8,000 votes.


=== Tenure ===
Whitesides was sworn into office on January 3, 2025. During his first term, he was appointed to the House Armed Services Committee and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. In March 2025, he co-sponsored the bipartisan DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act, a bill introduced by Nick Begich (R-AK), which passed the House and formalized collaboration between the Department of Energy and NASA to advance space exploration and energy innovation.
During his first week in office, Whitesides returned to Los Angeles to assist with wildfire response efforts, helping coordinate on-the-ground outreach following the Hurst Fire. In response to the broader 2025 Southern California wildfires, Whitesides – who had co-founded a wildfire prevention organization and emphasized urban wildfire risks during his campaign – co-sponsored the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act, which passed the House and aimed to improve forest management by easing environmental regulations and improving coordination of science-based fire prevention efforts across government agencies.
