The White House Student Film Festival was an annual film festival held by the White House and co-sponsored by the American Film Institute from 2014 to 2016. The festival was announced in November 2013 as part of the Barack Obama administration's initiative to bring "America's classrooms into the 21st century with high-speed internet and cutting-edge educational technology."
The festival has not been held after 2016 following the end of Obama's presidency in January 2017.

During the inaugural festival in 2014, students in Kindergarten through 12th Grade were able to submit short films about "why technology is so important, and how it will change the educational experience for kids in the future." 16 videos were selected to be screened out of over 2,500 submitted videos. Several celebrity guests were in attendance, including Kal Penn, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and Bill Nye.
The 16 video selections were sorted into four categories: Young Visionaries, Future Innovators, World of Tomorrow, and Building Bridges.
