Grant B. Cooper (April 1, 1903, in New York City – May 3, 1990), was the chief defense attorney in the murder trial against Sirhan Sirhan for the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Sirhan's more recent counsel has accused Cooper of deliberately throwing the Sirhan case as the result of a then-pending indictment against Cooper for possessing stolen transcripts of the grand jury proceedings in the Beverly Hills  Friar's Club card cheating case.  Cooper, who faced the possibility of jail time, was eventually fined $1000.  Cooper died in 1990 of an aortic aneurysm.
