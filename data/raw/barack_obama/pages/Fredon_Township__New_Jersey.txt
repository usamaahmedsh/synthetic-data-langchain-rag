Fredon Township ( FREE-dən) is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 3,235, a decrease of 202 (−5.9%) from the 2010 census count of 3,437, which in turn reflected an increase of 577 (+20.2%) from the 2,860 counted in the 2000 census.
In 1800, Isaac V. Coursen named the Stillwater Township area "Coursen's Corners" after establishing a post office in his store, the Coursen House, but changed the name to Fredon Village before his death in 1855. Stillwater Township's Bicentennial Committee obtained information from the Postmaster General which "states that 'Fredon' is derived from the German word 'fredonia,' meaning place of freedom." Fredon Township was incorporated on February 24, 1904, from portions of Andover Township, Green Township, Hampton Township and Stillwater Township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 17.92 square miles (46.40 km2), including 17.64 square miles (45.69 km2) of land and 0.28 square miles (0.71 km2) of water (1.53%).

The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway operated from 1872 until 1962 through the Paulinskill Valley, which runs along the border with Hampton and Stillwater Townships to the township's northwest, and was used to transport agricultural products to New York City. Today the right-of-way has been developed into the Paulinskill Valley Trail, a non-motorized multi-use trail that is part of the Kittatinny Valley State Park.
