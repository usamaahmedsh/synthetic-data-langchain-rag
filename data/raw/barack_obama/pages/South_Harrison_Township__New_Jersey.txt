== Government ==


=== Local government ===
South Harrison Township is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor.
As of 2025, members of the South Harrison Township Committee are Mayor Joseph Marino (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2027; term as mayor ends 2025), Deputy Mayor Robert J. Diaz (R, term on committee ends 2026; term as deputy mayor ends 2025), John Horner (R, 2027), Robert L. Richardson (R, 2025) and Robert Schenk (R, 2026).
In 2007, Charles Tyson was elected Mayor, the first African American to hold the post. He was re-elected in 2008. In 2009, however, he declined to seek re-election to a third term, citing the death threats and racist vandalism that had arisen. He had received threatening phone calls and emails, his tires were slashed, and "KKK" was written on a sign on his lawn. A federal indictment has charged a white supremacist from Virginia, Bill White, with "communicating threats in interstate commerce", based on White's emails to Tyson and phone calls to Tyson's wife in 2008. No arrests have been made, however, in connection with the incidents in 2007, even though the town posted a $24,000 reward.
