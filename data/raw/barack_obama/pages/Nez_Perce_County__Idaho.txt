Nez Perce County NEZZ-purse; is a county located in the U.S. state of Idaho. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 42,090. The county seat is Lewiston. The county is named after the Native American Nez Perce tribe. Nez Perce County is part of the Lewiston, Idaho–WA Metropolitan Statistical Area.


== History ==
Nez Perce County was originally organized in 1861, when the area was part of Washington Territory. It was reorganized in 1864 by the Idaho Territorial Legislature and was later subdivided into new counties. Rapid migration to the Palouse in the 1880s led to the formation of Latah County in 1888. Isolated from its county seat of Wallace in the Silver Valley, the southern portion of Shoshone County was annexed by Nez Perce County in 1904, then became Clearwater County in 1911. Lewis County was also formed from Nez Perce County in 1911.


== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 856 square miles (2,220 km2), of which 848 square miles (2,200 km2) is land and 8.2 square miles (21 km2) (1.0%) is water.
Nez Perce County has two rivers, the Clearwater and the Snake, which meet in Lewiston and then flow west. The Clearwater flows from the east and the Snake from the south, creating the state border with Washington (and further upstream, Oregon). The lowest point in the state of Idaho is located on the Snake River in Lewiston in Nez Perce County, where it flows out of Idaho and into Washington.
The northern portion of the county is part of the Palouse, a wide and rolling agricultural region of the middle Columbia basin.

== Government and politics ==
Nez Perce County is currently strongly Republican, though less so than southern Idaho: it is one of only nine counties (out of 44) in Idaho that has failed to vote Republican in every presidential election since 1968, and indeed supported Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton (by plurality) three times in succession from 1988 to 1996.
In 2004 Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry 62% to 36%. In 2008 Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama by a slightly smaller margin of 58.11 percent to 39.97 percent, a result almost exactly replicated by Mitt Romney in 2012. In 2016 Donald Trump increased the Republican majority to 62.2 percent as against Hillary Clinton's 28.1 percent.
