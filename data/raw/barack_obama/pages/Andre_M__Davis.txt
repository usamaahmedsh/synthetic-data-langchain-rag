== Federal judicial service ==


=== District court service ===
On May 4, 1995, President Bill Clinton nominated Davis to be a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland to a seat vacated by Judge Walter Evan Black Jr., who assumed senior status on October 21, 1994.The United States Senate confirmed Davis by a voice vote on August 11, 1995. He received his commission on August 14, 1995. His service terminated on November 12, 2009, due to elevation to the Fourth Circuit. In discussing his judicial philosophy, Davis told the Baltimore Sun in an article that was published on October 12, 2000 that "I want the loser—and I know there's always going to be a loser, that's the nature of the beast—but I want the loser to be able to say, 'I lost, but I was heard, and I believe that judge gave me every consideration in hearing my side.


=== Court of Appeals service ===
On October 12, 2000, President Clinton nominated Davis to be a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, to a seat vacated by Judge Francis Dominic Murnaghan Jr., who died on August 31, 2000. The nomination was a part of Clinton's effort to integrate the Fourth Circuit, which up to that point had never had an African-American judge; however, since Davis was nominated after July 1, 2000, the unofficial start date of the Thurmond Rule during a presidential election year, no hearings were scheduled on his nomination, and the nomination was returned to Clinton at the end of his term. President George W. Bush chose not to renominate Davis to the Fourth Circuit.
On April 2, 2009, President Barack Obama renominated Davis to the same seat of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On June 4, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the nomination by a 17–3 vote. On November 9, 2009, the Senate confirmed Davis by a 72–16 vote. He received his commission on November 10, 2009. Davis assumed senior status on February 28, 2014. Davis retired from active federal judicial service on August 31, 2017, and was named City Solicitor for the City of Baltimore by Mayor Catherine Pugh, effective September 1, 2017. Davis retired from that position on March 1, 2020.
