On March 23, 1900, a bill approved in the New Jersey Legislature created the Borough of Avon-by-the-Sea. On March 13, 1907, the eastern portion of Neptune City was annexed to the Borough of Bradley Beach. The borough was named for Neptune, the Roman water deity, and its location on the Atlantic Ocean.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Neptune City is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Neptune City is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2025, the mayor of the Borough of Neptune City is Democrat Rachel McGreevy, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Neptune City Borough Council are Council President Glen Kocsis (D, 2026), Kimberly Karalovich (D, 2027), Gail L. Oliver (D, 2027), Danielle Pappas (R, 2025), Pamela Renee (D, 2026) and Brian J. Thomas (R, 2025).
With Republican Richard Pryor and Democrat Michael Skudera tied at 602 votes after the November 2015 general election for the second of two seats, the two candidates faced off in a March 2016 special election, won by Pryor by a 511–478 margin.

Public school students in ninth through twelfth grades attend Neptune High School as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Neptune Township Schools; in a study published in May 2015, the district looked at modifying its relationship with the Neptune Township district, considering leaving the agreement unchanged, adding students in grades 6–8 to the sending arrangement or a regionalization of the two districts.

== Landmarks ==

Steiner and Son's Pajama Factory was the first factory built in Neptune City, constructed in 1891 on land donated by James A. Bradley. Immanuel Steiner was a silk dealer in Austria when he emigrated to New York City in the late 1860s. He began manufacturing pajamas and nightgowns in New York City shortly thereafter. With his sons Edwin and Clarence, they sought to expand operations, opting to construct the flagship factory at the corner of Fourth and Railroad Avenue (now Memorial Drive.) The construction costs were $17,590 and the brickwork was carried out by A.A. Taylor of Asbury Park. Their flagship product, "The Universal Nightshirt" became enormously popular throughout the country. Within two years time, they constructed another nearly identical factory three blocks north (since the 1930s this has been the home of The SS Adams Novelty Company). Their first national slogan was "We Put the World To Sleep".
By 1918, Steiner and Sons had nearly 2,000 employees in factories in Neptune City, Neptune, Asbury Park, Long Branch, Keyport, Freehold, Manasquan and Toms River. They built a baseball park on the land between the two factories on Fourth and Seventh Avenues. In the spring of 1922, Babe Ruth and other members of the New York Yankees played an exhibition game there. Edwin Steiner assumed control at his father's death, and he expanded the original building considerably. The Steiner corporation had a reputation for spotlessly clean working conditions, and the quality of their products is attested to in countless period advertisements stretching all the way to California.
The first ever murder in Neptune City occurred in 1929, as part of a payroll robbery. George Danielson, a 65-year-old courier from the First National Bank in Bradley Beach was shot point-blank at the employee entrance on 4th Avenue. The bandits got away with the payroll of $7,280 and were later caught and tried.
In the late 1920s, the Steiner corporation purchased and merged with the Liberty Nightshirt Company, headquartered in Baltimore. The decline in demand for nightshirts was one of the reasons for the acquisition. The same circumstances forced the company to shutter most of their other area operations. Tax squabbles with the Borough of Neptune City led them to close their long-time headquarters in Neptune City in 1939 and move to Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania. They eventually went out of business.
Mario Mirabelli and his brother Michael were running a military clothing manufacturing outfit in Elizabeth at the time when they purchased the building in 1940. They expanded their operations and won considerable government contracts during the Second World War. They produced close to $11 million worth of military clothing during the war. The Mirabelli Company continued to win military contracts after the war. Mario Mirabelli was called to testify before Congress in the late 1950s when government suppliers were accused of forcing the company to manufacture items using second-rate materials that were deemed unusable by other government manufacturing outfits. The scandal hurt Mirabelli's business and reputation. They continued to win small government contracts until the early 1960s, but eventually sold the building and went out of business.
Flea markets were held on the first floor in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Outerama, a company founded by Zenek Lapinsky in the late 1960s, continued to manufacture suits and jackets in the building until 1975 on the second and third floors. The bankruptcy of many of Outerama's clients led to the company's demise. The building was shuttered in 1976 and remained so for the next 25 years.
For nearly 20 years, the Borough of Neptune City sought to have the property revamped. In the early 1990s plans were underway to convert the building to retail shops and apartments, but funding was short, and the borough foreclosed on the owners before they could realize their goal. In 2000, the building was razed and condominiums were constructed. A demolition crane was destroyed when it fell into the side of the building during the wrecking operations.
The one and only motel in the Borough of Neptune City was the Charline Motel, located on Steiner Avenue.

NJ Transit offers local bus service on the 836 route. Train service is available at the Bradley Beach station. Commuter service runs between New York City's Pennsylvania Station and Bay Head on the North Jersey Coast Line.


== Climate change ==
Neptune City is projected to suffer substantial impacts from sea level rise caused by human-caused climate change, including a long-term loss of half its current population. Sea level rise has already resulted in flooding in Neptune City, with the period 2005–2014 experiencing 39 days of coastal flooding, over three times the average number of coastal flooding days for the decades between 1955 and 2004. In moderate sea level rise scenarios, Neptune City is projected to suffer a 68% chance risk of at least one major flood by 2050, and annual risk of flooding is projected to increase exponentially over the 21st century, with 100% risk of annual flooding for the years after 2100.
