== Federal judicial service ==
On August 3, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Brennan to serve as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, to the seat vacated by Judge Terence T. Evans, who assumed senior status on January 17, 2010. On January 3, 2018, his nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the United States Senate.
Upon the announcement of his nomination, Senator Tammy Baldwin criticized President Trump for bypassing the bipartisan commission composed to vet potential judicial candidates. She withheld her blue slip. However, her Republican counterpart in the Senate, Senator Ron Johnson, supported his nomination. On January 5, 2018, President Donald Trump announced his intent to renominate Brennan to the Seventh Circuit. On January 8, 2018, his renomination was sent to the Senate. On January 24, 2018, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On February 15, 2018, his nomination was reported out of the committee by an 11–10 vote. Democrats strongly objected to the vote, noting that Senator Tammy Baldwin was still withholding her blue slip. On May 9, 2018, the Senate agreed to invoke cloture on his nomination by a 49–47 vote. Brennan's nomination was confirmed on May 10, 2018, by a 49–46 vote. He received his judicial commission on May 11, 2018.
