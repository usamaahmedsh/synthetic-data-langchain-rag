The site of the battlefield originally contained many colonial-era farmhouses though many did not survive the rapid development of the area in the 20th century. Three of the original seven farmhouses that were present during the battle are still standing in the park. These include the Sutfin Farmhouse (1731); the Rhea-Applegate House (1745); and the Craig House (1746).
Near the battlefield lies the historic meadow creek housing development. Founded in the 2000s by K hovnanian, it has become home to a multitude of Indian and Russian immigrants. It remains a beautiful display of architecture featuring the villages and estates. European style townhouses paired with suburban American houses. The development is renowned for its clubhouse that features sports fields, a lounge, a pool, ping pong, and a gym.
Three other homes were built on the battlefield. The Conover-Perrine House (1832) is to the north of the park, erected on the site of the original 18th-century Perrine House, an important example of late Federal Architecture. The Italianate Cobb House was later constructed in 1872 near the Conover-Perrine House. The Combs' Farmhouse (mid-18th Century) was demolished sometime in the 1960s and was located near the park's playground and ice pond.
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, for its significance in military history and for the remaining settlement of colonial architecture and agriculture akin to the fated events of the Battle of Monmouth.
