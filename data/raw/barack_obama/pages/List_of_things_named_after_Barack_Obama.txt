However, the genus name Obama (flatworm) and in particular the invasive species Obama nungara were not named after Barack Obama. The name "Obama" in this case is a coincidence and is derived from the Tupi language (which is spoken in the same area where the flatworm was discovered) where it comes from the words "oba" ("leaf") and "ma" ("animal"), which is a reference to the body shape of species in this genus.
