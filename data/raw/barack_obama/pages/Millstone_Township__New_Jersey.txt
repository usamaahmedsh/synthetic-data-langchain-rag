== History ==

Millstone was originally inhabited by Lenape Native Americans prior to colonization. The township was said to have been founded by an English tanner, Clark prior to the Revolutionary War. Following colonization, Millstone ended up consisting of several villages, of which Clarksburg retains its historic character the most prominently. John Perrine purchased a large tract of land north of Clarksburg, which became known as Perrineville.
During the American Revolutionary War, Millstone held a secret post for the Continental Army, known as Signal Beacon #21. The Rising Sun Tavern, the township's first business, was used as an outpost by George Washington and later a headquarters for British General Sir Henry Clinton. The tavern accommodated other famous figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Joseph Bonaparte. The tavern was located on a stagecoach route between Philadelphia and Freehold.
United States president Theodore Roosevelt created a presidential retreat in Millstone.
Millstone was formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 28, 1844, from portions of Freehold Township and Upper Freehold Township, as well as part of Monroe Township in Middlesex County. The portions taken from Monroe Township were relinquished in 1845. On May 29, 1937, portions of the township were taken to form the borough of Jersey Homesteads (now Roosevelt).
The township has been one of the state's highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Millstone Township residents had a median household income of $156,891, ranked 9th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

=== Major bodies of water ===

Due to the township's unique location in the center of New Jersey, it is the home of numerous headwaters for various important rivers, brooks, and streams that flow throughout the state. The township is located on a ridge within the geographic heartland of New Jersey. The township falls within the hillier terrain and fertile soil found in the Inner coastal plain, while a small sliver of the eastern border of the township (which borders Jackson Township) is located within the flat terrain and sandier soil found in the Outer coastal plain.
Much of the township is centrally located within the much larger Raritan Valley region's watershed (as many of its brooks and streams flow into the river). The township is the headwaters for the Millstone River, one of the most important tributaries of the aforementioned river. Part of the township also belongs to the Delaware Valley region's watershed, with the Assunpink Creek and the Doctors Creek flowing through the southern and western sections of the township bordering Upper Freehold Township. Part of the Assunpink Wildlife Preservation Area is located in the township, as well as in portions of Upper Freehold Township, Roosevelt and Robbinsville Township. The reservation offers wetlands and lakes for viewing migratory birds, in addition to mountain biking trails, bridle paths and hiking trails, operated under the supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife. Turkey Swamp Park is another nature reservation which features wetlands, hiking trails, and even campgrounds, located in neighboring Freehold Township. The township is also one of only two municipalities in Monmouth County that are part of the Toms River watershed, most of which is located in Ocean County, as it rises from the Millstone and Jackson area, flowing southward through the New Jersey Pine Barrens to the Barnegat Bay.
