== History ==

Audubon Park was established as a community within Audubon in 1941 with the construction of 500 housing units for employees of New York Shipbuilding in Camden, New Jersey. It is named for naturalist John James Audubon. This was the first of eight projects undertaken by the Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division of the Federal Works Agency under the leadership of Colonel Lawrence Westbrook. Residents of Audubon, seeking to rid itself of the development's Democratic voters and its public school students, pushed for and passed a referendum to form Audubon Park in 1947. The Audubon Mutual Housing Corporation owns and administers all property in the borough and in turn is responsible for renting homes to residents.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===

Audubon Park is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Audubon Park is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2024, the mayor of Audubon Park is Republican Lawrence "Larry" Pennock, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Thomas Geobel (D, 2025), Judith DiPasquale (D, 2026), Gloria Jones (D, 2025), Karen Lewis (D, 2026), Cathleen Lowe (D, 2027) and Amy Paratore (D, 2027).
In January 2014, the borough council selected John Carpinelli from among three names nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the vacant seat that had been held by Frederick T. Passon until his death. Carpinelli served on an interim basis until the November 2014 general election, when he was elected to serve the balance of the term expiring in December 2015.
In May 2012, the borough council chose Judy DiPasquale from among a list of three names provided to fill the vacant seat of Charles Beeman.
