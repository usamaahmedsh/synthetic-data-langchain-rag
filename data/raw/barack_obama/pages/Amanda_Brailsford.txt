=== Federal judicial service ===
On January 18, 2023, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate Brailsford to serve as a United States district judge of the U.S. District Court in Idaho. On January 31, 2023, her nomination was sent to the United States Senate. President Biden nominated Brailsford to the seat vacated by Judge B. Lynn Winmill, who assumed senior status on August 16, 2021. On March 22, 2023, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On April 27, 2023, her nomination was reported out of committee by a voice vote. On May 4, 2023, the United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a voice vote. Brailsford received her judicial commission on May 17, 2023, and was sworn in on May 19, 2023. She is the first woman to serve on the U.S. District Court in Idaho.


==== Notable cases ====
In Creech v. United States District Court for the District of Idaho, Brailsford received calls to recuse herself from a lawsuit brought by death row inmate Thomas Eugene Creech alleging prosecutorial fabrication of evidence. Brailsford had a close personal friendship with Ada County Prosecutor Jan Bennetts, whose office oversaw the prosecution of Creech for the 1981 murder of inmate David Dale Jenson. While previously having clerked with and developed a friendship with Bennetts under Judge Thomas G. Nelson in 1993, Brailsford justified her lack of recusal by saying the two had "lost touch". Writing for a three judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Jay Bybee determined that, while Brailsford likely would have been able to hear the case in good faith, her impartiality would have been reasonably questioned due to the unique circumstances of the case, ultimately supporting her removal from the case.
