== Biography ==

Brown was the son of tenant farmers Jesse C. and Lucy Keeper Brown, who named him after John Young Brown, a former governor and neighbor. He was born on a farm near Geiger Lake, Union County, Kentucky, attended Union County schools and graduated from the high school at Sturgis, Kentucky. He graduated from Centre College at Danville, Kentucky with an A.B. degree in 1921 where he was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity and a "Scrub" player on the famous Centre Praying Colonels football team. He received his LL.B. degree from University of Kentucky College of Law in 1926 and was admitted to the bar that same year.
He was a well-known trial lawyer who practiced law from 1926 to 1985 in Lexington, Kentucky, with three firms: Brown and Miller, Brown and Son, and Brown, Sledd and McCann. He was noted for his extensive quotation of the Bible from memory during his summations to juries and his representation of coal miners.
Brown was elected to Congress in 1932 when the state failed to redistrict due to a reduction in the number of its House members and elected them at large. It was his only statewide victory. In 1934 he lost the Democratic nomination in the new Sixth District to Virgil Chapman. He lost the 1939 Democratic primary for governor to Lt. Gov. Keen Johnson and the primaries for the U.S. Senate in 1936 and 1942, the last one to Sen. A.B. "Happy" Chandler. He won the Senate nomination in 1946 over Phil Ardery but lost the general election to Republican John Sherman Cooper. He lost the 1948 Senate primary to Chapman, who was elected but died in 1951, and the 1960 primary to Johnson. He won the nomination in 1966 but lost again to Cooper. He finished second to Katherine Peden in the 1968 Democratic primary. 
Brown sponsored much legislation in the state House including the state's first sales-tax and civil-rights laws. He was recognized on many occasions as the most effective legislator in the House. He lost to Richard P. "Dick" Moloney in a 1951 primary for the state Senate.
