On January 7, 2011, President Obama nominated Higginbottom to the position of deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Beginning in March 2017, Higginbottom served as the chief operating officer of CARE, a major humanitarian agency delivering emergency relief and long-term international development to fight global poverty.
In 2019, Higginbottom was named head of the new JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter.
