Jean Galloway Bissell (June 9, 1936 – February 4, 1990) was a South Carolina attorney who became a high-ranking bank executive, and later a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Due West, South Carolina, Bissell earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of South Carolina in 1956 and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1958.


== Professional career ==
Bissell worked in private legal practice in Greenville, South Carolina from 1958 until 1971 and then in Columbia, South Carolina until 1976.

Bissell also lectured at the University of South Carolina in the 1970s and early 1980s.


== Federal judicial service ==
On May 24, 1984, Bissell was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to a new seat established by 96 Stat. 25 on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Reagan previously had nominated United States Department of Commerce official Sherman Unger to the seat in 1982, but Unger's nomination drew significant opposition and never was voted upon because Unger became afflicted with terminal cancer and died in late 1983. Bissell was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 8, 1984, and received her commission on June 11, 1984. With her confirmation, she became the first female South Carolina lawyer to become a federal judge. She served on the court until her death.
