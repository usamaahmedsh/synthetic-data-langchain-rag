Red Bank is a borough in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Incorporated in 1908, the community is on the Navesink River, the area's original transportation route to the Atlantic Ocean and to other ports. Red Bank is in the New York metropolitan area and is a commuter town of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 12,936, its highest decennial census count ever and an increase of 730 (+6.0%) from the 2010 census count of 12,206, which in turn had reflected an increase of 362 (+3.1%) from the 11,844 counted at the 2000 census. In the 2020 census, Red Bank was the fourth-most densely populated municipality in Monmouth County.
Red Bank was formed as a town on March 17, 1870, from parts of Shrewsbury Township. On February 14, 1879, Red Bank became Shrewsbury City, part of Shrewsbury Township; this lasted until May 15, 1879, when Red Bank regained its independence. On March 10, 1908, Red Bank was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature and was set off from Shrewsbury Township. The borough was named for the red soil along the Navesink River.
Downtown Red Bank is notable for its many local and well-known businesses including Garmany, Urban Outfitters, and Tiffany & Co. on and around Broad Street. Many annual events happen throughout the year, including the International Beer, Wine & Food Festival, a long-running sidewalk sale, a farmers' market, an indie film festival, the Red Bank Guinness Oyster Festival, a Halloween parade, and a holiday town lighting.


== History ==
Red Bank has been occupied by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The area of modern-day Red Bank was the territory of the Algonquian-speaking Lenape Native Americans, also called the Delaware by the English. The Lenape lived in the area between the Navesink River and the Shrewsbury River in an area they called Navarumsunk. The Native Americans traded freely with European settlers from England and the Dutch Republic in the mid-17th century, who purchased land in the area.
Originally part of "Shrewsbury Towne", Red Bank was named in 1736, when Thomas Morford sold Joseph French "a lot of over three acres on the west side of the highway that goes to the red bank". English colonists settled Red Bank beginning in the 17th century and it became a center for shipbuilding. Its population grew rapidly after 1809, when regularly scheduled passenger ships were established to serve the route to Manhattan.
By 1844, Red Bank had become a commercial and manufacturing center, focused on textiles, tanning, furs, and other goods for sale in Manhattan. With the dredging of the Navesink River about 1845, Red Bank became a port from which steamboats transported commuters to work in Manhattan. Red Bank grew in size as a result, and because the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad constructed a railway in the town in 1860.
In the 20th century, Red Bank was a strong cultural, economic, and political center in Monmouth County until it was hindered by the economic recession that began in 1987. During this time, its economy, based largely on retail commerce, was in decline, due to a real estate scandal. Local pundits and urban planners referred to the town as "Dead Bank".
Beginning in approximately 1991, under the New Jersey Development and Redevelopment Law, the borough authorized the creation of the Red Bank RiverCenter to manage redevelopment in what was designated as a special improvement district. RiverCenter retains authority over the management and redevelopment of a defined central business district, which includes Broad Street from the post office to Marine Park and from Maple Avenue to one block east of Broad Street. A number of urban redevelopment projects have taken place, including improved signage, distinctive and pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and lighting, a coherent design plan for Main Street and other major thoroughfares, and improving the condition of parking lots with landscaping.
The district as originally proposed was larger, to include the commercial areas west of Maple Avenue, including the antique buildings, The Galleria, and Shrewsbury Avenue. But some property owners in this area opposed paying the special assessment. Plans for the larger district advanced but opposition became more rigorous. The proposed district was amended to exclude opponents, and the district that was adopted stops on Maple Avenue.

Red Bank has eight parks, with one new park being planned as of 2023. The largest is Count Basie Park, which includes baseball fields, basketball courts, playground, track, a small trail along Mohawk Pond, and restrooms. Eastside Park, the only park located east of Broad Street, consists of a playground, soccer field, softball field, basketball court, tennis courts, benches, picnic tables, walking paths, lawn, and restrooms. Along the Navesink River, there are three parks: Marine Park, which consists of a playground, benches, boat basin, picnic tables, lawn, and restrooms; Riverside Gardens Park, which has picnic tables, benches, boardwalk, lawn, and restrooms; and Maple Cove Park, which includes a lawn and kayak launch.

There are plans to build a new large park called Sunset Avenue Park along the Swimming River on a former landfill site in the southwestern part of the borough. The park is to include wooded trails, sledding hills, a lawn, playground, boardwalk, picnic pavilion, plaza, a living wall, skatepark, kayak launch, and two parking lots. There is also a plan to completely redo Marine Park, finalized in 2019. The final concept plan includes an entry plaza with a water feature, a memorial plaza, restrooms, lawns, natural playground, event lawn/seasonal ice rink, pier, food truck space, pavilion, kayak launch, marina, sculptured waterfront plaza, shade structures, a riverboat attraction, a waterfront walkway, a parking lot, storm water management, and pump stations.

The only waterfront walkways that currently exist are those found in Marine Park, Riverside Gardens Park, Maple Cove, as well as the privately owned walkways at the Molly Pitcher Inn and Oyster Point Hotel, and at condominiums. Red Bank has the long term plan of connecting the entire waterfront via one large publicly accessible waterfront walkway. The two main priorities are connecting the waterfronts between Marine Park and Riverside Gardens Park; as well as connecting Bellhaven Nature Area with the future Sunset Avenue Park. The borough also is in the works of making the waterfront property owned by Riverfront Medical Center into a publicly accessible waterfront.

Other recreational facilities within Red Bank include a YMCA, Red Bank Public Library, Boys & Girls Club of Monmouth County, boat & yacht clubs, and the Red Bank senior center.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Since July 1, 2023, Red Bank has been governed under the Faulkner Act (council–manager) form of government; the borough form has been used since the borough's incorporation in 1908, and all members then serving in office under the old form had their terms end in June 2023. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and a six-member borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a non-partisan basis to serve four-year terms of office (after the initial election). In the May 2023 municipal election, a mayor and council were elected under the new form, with council members randomly assigned so that four serve two-year teams and two serve four-year terms. The Council voted in July 2023 to move elections to November, so four council seats will be up for election in November 2025, with the mayor and the other two council seats up for vote in November 2027, with that cycle continuing in odd-numbered years; the change to November elections meant that the council members elected in 2023 had their term-end month shifted from June to December.
As of 2025, the mayor of Red Bank is William J. Portman, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Borough Council are Deputy Mayor Kate Triggiano (2027), Kristina Bonatakis (term ending 2025), David Cassidy (2025), Nancy Facey-Blackwood (2027), Ben Forest (2025) and Laura Jannone (2025), all of whom were elected together on the "Red Bank's Ready" slate at the May 2023 election.

Monmouth County is governed by a Board of County Commissioners composed of five members who are elected at-large to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats up for election each year as part of the November general election. At an annual reorganization meeting held in the beginning of January, the board selects one of its members to serve as director and another as deputy director.
