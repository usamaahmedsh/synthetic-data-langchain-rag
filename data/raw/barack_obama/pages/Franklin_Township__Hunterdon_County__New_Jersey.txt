Franklin Township is a township in central Hunterdon County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 3,267, an increase of 72 (+2.3%) from the 2010 census count of 3,195, which in turn reflected an increase of 205 (+6.9%) from the 2,990 counted in the 2000 census. Most of the township lies on the Hunterdon Plateau with only the eastern section along the South Branch Raritan River being on the lower part of the Newark Basin.


== History ==
Long populated by the Lenape (Delaware) Native Americans, the first European settlement of present-day Franklin was around 1700, when it became a Quaker community of settlers who came from Burlington County. The most reliable records that are available about the early days of the Township are found in the minutes of the Friends' Meeting in Quakertown.
Franklin Township was established by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 7, 1845, when it was created from portions of Kingwood Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. Portions of the township were taken to form Clinton town on April 5, 1865. The township was named for Benjamin Franklin.
The rich soil made the township a center of agriculture for hundreds of years. While Franklin Township had long hosted a major dairy farming industry, in modern times, the primary crops have been corn, hay and soybeans.


== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 23.18 square miles (60.02 km2), including 23.04 square miles (59.66 km2) of land and 0.14 square miles (0.36 km2) of water (0.60%).
Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Allens Corner, Alvater Corner, Cherryville (previously known as Dogtown), Grandin, Kingtown, Lansdowne, Littletown, Oak Grove, Pittstown, Quakertown (previously known as Fairview), Sidney and Sunnyside. Pittstown, previously known as Hoffs, is also spread across Alexandria Township and Union Township.
The Capoolong Creek, which runs through Pittstown, was an attraction to early settlers and they soon established three of the oldest churches in present-day Hunterdon: Thomas Episcopal, established in 1723, Bethlehem Presbyterian, organized in 1730 and the Quaker Church in 1733.
The township borders the Hunterdon County municipalities of Alexandria Township, Clinton, Clinton Township, Delaware Township, Kingwood Township, Raritan Township and Union Township.
