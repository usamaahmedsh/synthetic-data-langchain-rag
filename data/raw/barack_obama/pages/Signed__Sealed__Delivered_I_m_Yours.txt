"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)" is a song by American musician Stevie Wonder. It was written by Wonder along with Lee Garrett, Syreeta Wright, and Lula Mae Hardaway for his twelfth studio album Signed, Sealed & Delivered (1970), with production overseen by the singer. The song was released in June 1970 as a single on Motown's Tamla label. It spent six weeks at number one on the US R&B chart and peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. 


== Background ==
The song was a series of firsts for the 20-year-old Wonder: "Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)" was the first single Wonder produced on his own, and was also the first to feature his female backup singing group composed of Lynda Tucker Laurence (who went on to become a member of the Supremes), Syreeta Wright (who also co-wrote the song and later married Wonder), and Venetta Fields. "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours" was arranged by Paul Riser and features an electric sitar  played by Eddie "Chank" Willis. In the lyrics, the singer has left his girlfriend but realizes it was a mistake.  "I've done a lot of foolish things that I really didn't mean."  Now he has returned, making the commitment that he's back, similar to a special delivery package from the post office, "signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours."


== Critical reception ==
The song gave Wonder his sixth Grammy nomination, with the award that year going to the Clarence Carter song "Patches". Cash Box stated that "Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)" was "polished and powerful enough to maintain an adult market power as well pointing toward giant sales." Billboard called it a "funky beat swinger" with "blockbuster sales appeal." Rolling Stone ranked the song 203rd on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

American singer Janet Jackson was originally approached to cover the song with the group but could not proceed due to scheduling conflicts.


=== Critical reception ===
Betty Clarke from The Daily Telegraph called the song a "grunting cover," while AllMusic's Sharon Mawer found that "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours" was "just not as strong a song" as "Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word." In a negative review, BBC Music critic Chris Long wrote: "Not even the presence of the legendary Stevie Wonder and the equally fantastic Angie Stone on "Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours" can get the party started. Their appearance only serves to show how untalented these four lads are." 


=== Chart performance ===
"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours"  peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. It was Blue's first single to miss the chart's top ten. Elsewhere, the song reached the top 20 on the charts of six other countries, including Denmark, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain.

A music video for "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours" was directed by Max & Dania and largely filmed on the roof of the Maxfield Building on Santee Street in Downtown Los Angeles.
