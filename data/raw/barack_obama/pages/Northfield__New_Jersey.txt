=== Local government ===
Northfield operates under the City form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 15 municipalities (of the 564) statewide. Under this form of government, the council functions as a legislative body: it passes ordinances and approves the appointments of the mayor. The mayor, as executive, is responsible for administrative functions and appointment of all officials. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a city council who are chosen in partisan elections held as part of the November general election. The mayor serves a four-year term of office. The City Council includes seven members, with one member elected at-large to a four-year term in office and six who are elected from wards to three-year terms on a staggered basis with two seats up for election each year.
As of 2023, the Mayor of Northfield is Republican Erland V.L. Chau, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the City Council are Council President Tom Polistina (R, 2023; 2nd Ward), Carolyn Bucci (R, 2024; 2nd Ward), Renee Carfagno (R, 2025; 1st Ward), Gregory Dewees (R, 2025; At Large), Eric Leeds (R, 2025; 2nd Ward), David Notaro (R, 2023; 1st Ward) and Brian L.

In the November 2014 general election, Republican Erland Chau was chosen to fill the balance of the mayoral seat expiring December 31, 2015. Jerry McGee had been appointed by the council in February 2014 to fill the seat on an interim basis after Democrat Vince Mazzeo had resigned to take a seat in the New Jersey General Assembly. The city council chose Jeff Lischin in December 2014 to fill the vacant council seat of Erland Chau expiring in December 2016. Lischin will serve on an interim basis until the November 2015 general election, at which time the voters will select a candidate to serve the balance of the unexpired term.
