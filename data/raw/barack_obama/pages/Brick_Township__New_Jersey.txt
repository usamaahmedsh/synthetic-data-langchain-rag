Brick Township is a township in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city was the Jersey Shore's third most populous municipality and retained its position as the 13th-most-populous statewide, with a population of 73,620, a decrease of 1,452 (−1.9%) from the 2010 census count of 75,072, which in turn reflected a decline of 1,047 residents (−1.4%) from its population of 76,119 at the 2000 census, when it was the state's 12th most-populous municipality.
A majority of Brick Township is located on the mainland. Ocean Beaches I, II, and III are situated on the Barnegat Peninsula, a long, narrow barrier peninsula that separates Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. The mainland and beach area of the town are not geographically adjacent. Brick Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 15, 1850, from portions of both Dover Township (now Toms River Township) and Howell Township. The township was named after Joseph Brick, the owner of Bergen Iron Works located on the Metedeconk River. Portions of the township were taken to form Point Pleasant Beach (May 18, 1886), Bay Head (June 15, 1886), Lakewood Township (March 23, 1892), Mantoloking (April 10, 1911) and Point Pleasant (April 21, 1920). In 1963, voters rejected a referendum that would have changed the township's name to "Laurelton".
After hovering for years in the top five, in 2006, the township earned the title of "America's Safest City", out of 371 cities included nationwide in the 13th annual Morgan Quitno survey. Since the year 2000, Brick Township has been the safest "city" (population over 75,000) in New Jersey. In 2003 and 2004, Brick Township was ranked as the second safest city in the United States, after Newton, Massachusetts. In 2005, Brick Township had dropped down to the fifth safest "city" (population over 75,000) in the United States, before it rebounded to the top in 2006.


== History ==
In 1850, when the New Jersey State Legislature created Ocean County, New Jersey From parts of Monmouth and Burlington Counties, it also created Brick Township from parts of Howell and Dover Townships (Toms River). The new Township was named for its most prominent citizen, Joseph W. Brick, the industrious owner of Bergen Iron Works at the time Brick Township was created.
The Havens Homestead Museum is dedicated to the Havens family that originally settled in the Laurelton/Burrsville section of Brick. The museum is the original Havens home which lies on a small plot of farmland. The museum has a gift shop and runs tours of the property daily.
Brick Township has also been in the news for a claimed autism epidemic, in which 40 children out of over 6,000 surveyed were found to be autistic, though Brick's autism rate is statistically near the national average. Many of the children found to be autistic were born in Northern New Jersey and other parts of the country. There is no evidence that the levels of autism are linked to any specific environmental factor in Brick. Parents of children diagnosed with autism have moved to the township in order to make use of the special education programs offered by the school district.
Brick has been affected by the heroin epidemic. According to the state's statistics, in 2012 Brick was ranked sixth in the state with 550 reported incidents of heroin or opiate abuse, behind Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Atlantic City and Camden. In 2017, Brick improved to 438 reported heroin abuse cases, ranked ninth in the state.
On July 11, 2004, Brick Memorial High School student, Brittney Gregory went missing. The news of her disappearance went on national news. Her body was found in a shallow grave, after a woman led the police to the area, just off. Suspect Jack Fuller Jr., a drug addict and acquaintance to Gregory's father admitted to killing Gregory. Fuller stated that he was giving her a ride to her boyfriend's house. Fuller began smoking crack in the car and Gregory became upset. Fuller punched Gregory several times and when she died, he buried her.
During the December 2010 North American blizzard, Brick Township received 30 inches (760 mm) of snow, the highest accumulation recorded in the state. In October 2012, parts of Brick were devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Barrier island and other waterfront properties were particularly hard hit. Homes and such buildings as the Shore Acres Yacht Club sustained major damage; some buildings had to be demolished.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
The township operates within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Mayor-Council plan 2 form of government, as implemented on January 1, 1990, based on direct petition. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is composed of the Mayor and the seven-member Township Council, whose members are elected to serve four-year terms of office, with either three seats (and the mayoral seat) or four seats up for election at-large in partisan elections held on a staggered basis in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected for a four-year term without limitation as to the number of terms. In November 1988, the voters approved a referendum which returned the township to the partisan system of government, with township elections held as part of the November general election (rather than in May).
The mayor is the township's chief executive and administrative officer and is responsible for administering local laws and policy development. The mayor makes various appointments, prepares the township's budget, and approves or vetoes ordinances adopted by the Township Council (which may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the Township Council). The mayor appoints, with the advice and consent of the Township Council, the business administrator, the township attorney, and the directors of the Departments of Public Safety, Engineering and Public Works.
As of 2024, the mayor of Brick Township is Democrat Lisa Crate, who was appointed to serve a term of office ending on December 31, 2025. Members of the Township Council are Council President Vincent Minichino (D, 2027), Council Vice President Steve Feinman (D, 2027), Perry Albanese (R, 2025), Derrick T. Ambrosino (D, 2027), Heather deJong (D, 2025), Marianna Pontoriero (D, 2025) and Melissa Travers (D, 2027).
In February 2023, the township council selected Lisa Crate from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the vacant mayoral seat expiring in December 2025, following mayor John G. Ducey's resignation to take a seat as a New Jersey Superior Court Judge; Crate served on an interim basis pending the November 2023 special election where she defeated Assemblyman John Catalano.  In turn, the council selected Melissa Travers to fill the vacant council seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Crate.
In October 2022, the council appointed Derrick Ambrosino to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Arthur Halloran until his resignation the previous month.
In January 2014, the Township Council appointed Andrea Zapcic to fill the vacant council seat expiring in December 2015 of John G. Ducey after he took office as mayor. Zapcic won election in November 2014 to serve the balance of the term.
Ducey was elected as mayor in 2013, garnering 62% of the vote to defeat Republican opponent Joseph Sangiovanni.
Former Democratic Mayor Joseph C. Scarpelli resigned as of December 8, 2006, amid a federal corruption probe into township government. On January 8, 2007, Scarpelli pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges for accepting money from developers in exchange for using his official position to obtain approval for development projects. Township Clerk Virginia Lampman was appointed to fill the role of mayor until the Township Council could select a replacement. On December 17, 2007, Scarpelli was sentenced in Federal Court in Newark to serve 18 months in prison, and fined $5,000, after admitting that he had accepted bribes from 1998 to 2003.
On January 4, 2007, Daniel J. Kelly (D), the Township's Planning Board chairman, was appointed the new mayor by a three-member township council subcommittee. On November 6, 2007, Stephen C. Acropolis defeated Kelly in a race to fill the remaining two years of Scarpelli's term.

WBGD 91.9FM (Brick Green Dragons) went on the air in 1974, originally located at Brick Township High School. The station was later moved to Brick Memorial High School. The radio station was the brainchild of a teacher named Robert Boesch who taught electronics at Brick Township High School in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The station was a student-run operation and received its FCC license from the FCC for Educational Broadcasting.
One of the most notable broadcasts was the first ever state high school football championship game played between Brick Township High School and Camden High School in December 1974. The Brick Green Dragons defeated Camden by a score of 21–20 on the last play of the game to win the title.
In 2007, during routine roof maintenance and repair work, the broadcast tower was cut off the roof, and was never replaced or repaired. In 2010 WBGD's license was retired.
