== Government ==


=== Local government ===

The Borough of Hawthorne is governed under the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, within the Mayor-Council system of municipal government. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the seven-member borough council. A Charter Study Commission, formed in the 1980s after two major commercial businesses left the borough, led to a recommendation for the adoption of a mayor–council form in which there are four wards to give residents a representative in each area of the community, in addition to a mayor and two at-large members of the borough council, all of whom are directly elected by residents, with all members of the governing body serving four-year terms of office. After residents approved the commission's recommendations, the first election under the mayor–council form was held in 1989. The four ward seats are up for vote together and the three at-large seats and the mayoral position up for vote together two years later. All elections are held on a partisan basis as part of the November general election.

Matthews (R, Ward 4, 2023), Dominic Mele (R, at-large, 2025), Ann Marie Sasso (R, at-large, 2025), Michael Sciarra (R, Ward 3, 2023; elected to serve an unexpired term) and Joseph R. Wojtecki (D, Ward 1, 2023).
In January 2020, the borough council appointed Michael Sciarra to fill the Ward 3 expiring in December 2023 that had been won by Garret G. Sinning, who died two weeks after winning re-election; Sciarra served on an interim basis until the November 2020 general election, when voters chose him to serve the balance of the term of office.
