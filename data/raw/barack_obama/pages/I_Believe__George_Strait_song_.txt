Strait and his band were finished recording the album when Norma, George's wife, made everyone unpack and cut the Newtown, Connecticut-inspired single "At its core, ‘I Believe’ is about faith — a subject this singer has approached with underrated deftness" and "puts his faith on display as never before" "Strait was hesitant to include the song, as he didn’t want to misrepresent the families of the victims or be accused of somehow profiting from their tears... his sincerity triumphs on this beautifully crafted tribute to the victims." The victims that inspired this song where the lives taken from a school shooting in Newtown Connecticut in December 2012.

She states, "Strait’s voice is as solid as ever" and that "he perfectly emotes the sincerity and compassion that a song of this magnitude requires." She finishes by saying "I Believe" is "just a tribute from a humble man conveying a simple sentiment of real heartbreak, buoyed by faith and hope."
