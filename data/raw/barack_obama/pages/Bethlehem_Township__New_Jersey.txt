== History ==
Before European settlement, the land was settled by the Lenape Native Americans, whose presence remains in the names of places and bodies of water in the township.
Bethlehem was first mentioned in official records dating back to 1730, though details of its formation are uncertain. Bethlehem was incorporated as one of New Jersey's initial 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form Kingwood Township (1749, date uncertain), Alexandria Township (March 5, 1765), Union Township (February 17, 1853), Junction borough (February 20, 1895, now known as Hampton borough), Bloomsbury (March 30, 1905) and Glen Gardner (March 26, 1919).
The township was named for the city of Bethlehem.

=== Climate ===

Bethlehem Township falls under the "Northern New Jersey" climate zone. According to the Office of the New Jersey State Climatologist at Rutgers University, the Northern climate zone covers about one-quarter of New Jersey and consists mainly of elevated highlands and valleys which are part of the Appalachian Uplands. Surrounded by land, this region can be characterized as having a continental climate with minimal influence from the Atlantic Ocean, except when the winds contain an easterly component. Prevailing winds are from the southwest in summer and from the northwest in winter. Being in the northernmost portion of the state, and with small mountains up to 1,800 feet (550 m) in elevation, the Northern Zone normally exhibits a colder temperature regime than other climate regions of the State of New Jersey. This difference is most dramatic in winter when average temperatures in the Northern Zone can be more than ten degrees Fahrenheit cooler than in the Coastal Zone. Annual snowfall averages 40 to 50 inches (1,000 to 1,300 mm) in the northern zone as compared with an average of 10 to 15 inches (250 to 380 mm) in the extreme south.
Bethlehem Township falls under the USDA 6a Plant Hardiness zone.


=== Wildlife and ecosystem ===
Various animals are native to central-western New Jersey, including red fox (vulpes vulpes), black bear, groundhogs, wild turkeys, deer, squirrels, chipmunks, a variety of birds, and a wide variety of insects and vegetation. There are also some fish in the streams of the county.
Trees include deciduous varieties and evergreen varieties.
Black bears are the largest land mammals in New Jersey and are known to be most abundant in the northern-western regions of the state, including Bethlehem Township.
