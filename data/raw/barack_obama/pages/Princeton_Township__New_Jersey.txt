Princeton Township was a township in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, that existed from 1838 until the end of 2012. On January 1, 2013, it merged with the Borough of Princeton to form Princeton, New Jersey; both Princeton Township and the Borough of Princeton were dissolved in the merger.
As of the 2010 United States census, the township's population was 16,265, reflecting an increase of 238 (+1.5%) from the 16,027 counted in the 2000 census, which had in turn increased by 2,829 (+21.4%) from the 13,198 counted in the 1990 census.
Princeton was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 9, 1838, from portions of West Windsor Township in Mercer County and Montgomery Township in Somerset County. The Borough of Princeton — created on February 11, 1813 within the area that later became Princeton Township — became a fully independent municipality circa 1894. Portions of territory were ceded to the Borough of Princeton on January 4, 1928 and August 21, 1951. On November 8, 2011, voters in Princeton Township voted to consolidate with Princeton Borough, a change that took effect on January 1, 2013.
The Institute for Advanced Study, a private research institution that has been an academic home to Albert Einstein, Kurt Gödel, and many other famous and prize-winning scientists, is located in the former township. Princeton University is located mostly within the former borough, but parts of the campus extended into what was Princeton Township.
Drumthwacket, the official residence of the governor of New Jersey, is located at 344 Stockton Street in the area of the former township.
The last day Princeton Township existed as an independent municipality was December 31, 2012.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Princeton Township was governed under the Township form of government with a five-member Township Committee. The Township Committee was elected directly by the voters in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with one seat coming up for election each year. A Mayor and Deputy Member were elected by the Committee from among its members and serve a one-year term. The Mayor served as the Chairperson of the Committee and exercised executive powers vested in the Mayor's Office by law. All legislative powers were assigned to the Committee. 104 of the 565 municipalities in New Jersey operate with a five-member Committee form of local government.
An Administrator was also empowered by ordinance to serve in an executive capacity and direct the Township's day-to-day operations.
Members of the final Princeton Township Committee were Mayor Chad Goerner (D, term ended December 31, 2012), Deputy Mayor Liz Lempert (D, 2013), Lance Liverman (D, 2013), Bernard P. Miller (D, 2014) and Sue Nemeth (D, 2014).


=== Merger of Borough and Township ===

In Princeton Borough 1,385 voted for, 902 voted against while in Princeton Township 3,542 voted for and 604 voted against. Proponents of the consolidation measure asserted that when the merger is completed, the new municipality of Princeton will save $3.2 million as a result of some scaled-down services, including layoffs of 15 government workers, including 9 police officers (however, the measure itself does not create any line item cost reduction or layoffs). Opponents to the consolidation measure asserted that cost savings alleged by a widely circulated report were incorrect and/or unsubstantiated and that individual voter representation would be diluted by the merged municipal structure. The consolidation is to take effect in 2013.
