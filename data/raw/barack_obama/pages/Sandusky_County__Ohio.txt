The county has a strong history of supporting Republican presidential candidates as well as local Republican candidates.

It was the second time since 1964 that the county had supported a Democrat for president, and the second time since 1932 that it had done so with a majority. Obama narrowly carried the county again in the 2012 U.S. presidential election with just under 50 percent of the vote. Time magazine listed Sandusky as one of five critical counties in the 2012 election. In 2016 and 2020 the county supported the Republican candidate.
