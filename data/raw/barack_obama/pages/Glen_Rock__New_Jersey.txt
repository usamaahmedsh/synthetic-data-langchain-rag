== History ==
Glen Rock was formed on September 14, 1894, from portions of Ridgewood Township and Saddle River Township during the "Boroughitis" phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. The main impetus for the break from Ridgewood Township was the decision to have Glen Rock students attend a new school closer to the center of Ridgewood instead of their one-room schoolhouse located at the intersection of Ackerman Avenue and Rock Road. Originally, the borough was to be named "South Ridgewood", but the name was changed to Glen Rock before the proposal for the borough was submitted. Both the origin of the name Glen Rock and the cause of it becoming the borough's name are unclear.
The borough was settled around the Glen Rock, a large boulder in a small valley (glen), from which the borough gets its name. The rock, a glacial erratic weighing in at 570 short tons (520 t) and located where Doremus Avenue meets Rock Road, is believed to have been carried to the site by a glacier that picked up the rock 15,000 years ago near Peekskill, New York, and carried it for 20 miles (32 km) to its present location. The Lenape Native Americans called the boulder "Pamachapuka" (meaning "stone from heaven" or "stone from the sky") and used it for signal fires and as a trail marker.
The borough was the site of one of Bergen County's most serious public transportation accidents. In 1911, a trolley operator for the North Jersey Rapid Transit Company, one day away from retirement, died in a crash with an opposing trolley around the intersection of Prospect and Grove Streets that was caused by signal problems. In addition to the death of the opposing trolley operator, 12 people were injured. This crash in part hastened the demise of this transportation mode which ran from Elmwood Park, New Jersey, to Suffern, New York, and competed with the Erie Railroad. The right of way for this trolley line was purchased by the Public Service Enterprise Group and is still visible today.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===

Glen Rock is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.
The borough form of government used by Glen Rock is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council. The council appoints a professional borough administrator who is the chief administrative officer of the borough, responsible to the mayor and council.
As of 2024, the mayor of Glen Rock is Democrat Kristine Morieko, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Jill Orlich (D, 2024), Mary Barchetto (D, 2024), Teresa M. G. Gilbreath (D, 2025), Paula Gilligan (D, 2025), Amy Martin (D, 2026) and Regina Viadro (D, 2026).
In January 2020, the borough council chose Caroline Unzaga from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held by Kristine Morieko until she stepped down to take office as mayor.
In July 2019, the borough council selected Michelle Torpey from a list of three names nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that was vacated by Bill J. Leonard Jr. after he resigned from office and announced that he was moving out of the borough.
Bruce Packer won the mayoral seat in the 2015 general election over incumbent John van Keuren, who had been seeking a fourth term. Packer's Democratic running-mates William "Skip" Huisking and Kristine Morieko were also elected to three-year Borough Council terms, giving the borough a Democratic mayor for the first time in 12 years, and a 3–3 split on the council.
Glen Rock's borough government recognizes an annual Poverty Awareness Week. The community comes together for an annual project to combat extreme global poverty. In 2007, the community built a Habitat House in Paterson, New Jersey (the second home built by Glen Rock residents), and the community was honored as Paterson Habitat's Volunteers of the Year (a first for a community). In 2008, the Borough came together for the Water for Africa Music Festival. The event raised the funds to pay for two Roundabout PlayPump water systems in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2009, the community continued its battle against poverty, raising funds to battle malaria in hurricane-ravaged Haiti.
The borough government has declared Glen Rock a sustainable community, pursuing a "Green Up" policy that reflects a commitment to protecting the borough's trees, water and general environment. Shade trees are provided at no cost annually to citizens with cooperation from the DPW. On April 10, 2019, the borough council passed an ordinance outlawing single-use plastic bags in retail establishments.
