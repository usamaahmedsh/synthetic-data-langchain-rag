Operation Observant Compass was a multinational military operation conducted from October 2011 to April 2017, aimed at combating the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and its leader Joseph Kony in Central Africa. The operation was primarily a United States-led advisory mission that supported regional African forces in their efforts to capture or neutralize LRA leadership and reduce the group's capacity to conduct attacks against civilian populations. It was overseen by United States Africa Command.


== Background ==
The operation was launched in response to the continued activities of the LRA, which had been responsible for widespread atrocities across Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan for over two decades. The LRA, led by Joseph Kony, had gained international notoriety for its brutal tactics, including the abduction of children for use as soldiers and sex slaves, the displacement of millions of people, and the commission of numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity.


== Scope ==
The operation involved approximately 100 U.S. military advisors who were deployed to support the efforts of the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) and other regional military forces. The American personnel provided intelligence, logistics, and communications support, as well as training and advisory services to enhance the effectiveness of regional forces in tracking and confronting LRA units operating across multiple countries.  According to NBC News, the area of operation was reported to be almost the size of California.


== Countries ==
The operation was conducted across four countries: Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan. This multi-national scope reflected the LRA's strategy of operating across borders to avoid capture and exploit weak governance in remote areas. The cross-border nature of the operation required extensive coordination between different national military forces and the establishment of joint operational centers to share intelligence and coordinate activities.


== Outcome ==
During the six-year operation, regional forces succeeded in significantly degrading the LRA's operational capacity and reducing its ability to conduct large-scale attacks against civilian populations. The operation resulted in the capture or surrender of several high-ranking LRA commanders and the rescue of hundreds of abducted children and adults. The LRA's strength was reduced from an estimated 400-500 fighters at the operation's inception to fewer than 100 by its conclusion.


== Tactics ==
The operation employed various tactics including air reconnaissance, ground patrols, intelligence gathering, and the use of local networks to track LRA movements. Special emphasis was placed on protecting civilian populations through early warning systems and the establishment of safe zones in areas where LRA activity was reported. The operation also included psychological warfare elements, such as the use of radio broadcasts and leaflets to encourage LRA defections and inform local populations about the ongoing military efforts.
One of the significant challenges faced during Operation Observant Compass was the vast and difficult terrain across which the LRA operated, including dense forests, remote areas with limited infrastructure, and regions affected by ongoing conflicts. The LRA's familiarity with local terrain and their ability to blend with civilian populations made tracking and engaging them extremely difficult. Additionally, the operation had to navigate complex political situations in the various countries where it operated, each with different military capabilities, political priorities, and security concerns.


== Conclusion ==
The operation officially concluded in April 2017, with the U.S. military advisors withdrawing from the region. While Joseph Kony remained at large, the operation was generally considered successful in significantly reducing the LRA's threat to civilian populations and degrading the organization's military capabilities. The end of the operation marked a transition to continued regional efforts to address the remaining LRA presence and support the recovery of affected communities.
The legacy of Operation Observant Compass includes lessons learned about multinational counterinsurgency operations, the importance of sustained commitment to addressing regional security challenges, and the need for comprehensive approaches that combine military action with humanitarian assistance and post-conflict recovery efforts. The operation demonstrated both the possibilities and limitations of international military intervention in addressing complex security challenges in Africa.
