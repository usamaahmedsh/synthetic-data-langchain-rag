Chesterfield Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 9,422, its highest decennial census count ever and an increase of 1,723 (+22.4%) from the 2010 census count of 7,699, which in turn had reflected an increase of 1,744 (+29.3%) from the 5,955 counted at the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.
Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than 7,000 acres (2,800 ha) of farmland through state and county programs and a township-wide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated "receiving area" known as Old York Village, which is a neo-traditional, New Urbanism community built on 560 acres (230 ha) incorporating a variety of housing types, neighborhood commercial facilities, a new elementary school, civic uses, and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village. Construction began in the early 2000s and a significant percentage of the community is now complete. As of 2024, the majority of the construction is complete, including Old York Village's mixed-use commercial, retail, and housing component. Old York Village was the winner of the American Planning Association's National Outstanding Planning Award in 2004.


== History ==

The land was first settled in 1677, when a group of primarily Quaker immigrants from England established the settlement of Crosswicks, the oldest of the three communities of the township. The village was named after the Crosswicks Creek that separates Burlington and Mercer counties. The other two villages were Recklesstown (now Chesterfield) and Plattsburg (now Sykesville). Recklesstown was named in honor of one of its founders, Joseph Reckless, until the community's name was changed in 1888 at the urging of a Congressman and local resident in the face of public scorn.
Chesterfield Township was originally formed on November 6, 1688. It was named after the 2nd Earl of Chesterfield whose seat of Chesterfield was in Derbyshire, where many of the township's earliest settlers had lived. The township was reformed by royal charter on January 10, 1713, and was incorporated as one of New Jersey's initial 104 townships by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form New Hanover Township (December 2, 1723) and Bordentown borough (December 9, 1825).
Crosswicks played a role during the American Revolutionary War. On June 23, 1778, British soldiers near the Crosswicks Creek shot the horse out from under Elias Dayton, a captain with the New Jersey militia. A cannonball from the period remains lodged in the side of the Friends Meeting House.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===

Chesterfield Township is governed under the township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At a reorganization meeting held in January of each year, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor, which by tradition has the committeeperson serving the last year of term in office chosen to serve as mayor. The Township Committee serves both as the township's executive and legislative body, and derives from the state statutes which delegates powers, prescribe the offices and structure and establish various procedures under which the Township must operate. In the 2013 general election, voters approved an expansion of the Township Committee from three members to five, with three seats up for election in November 2014; the existing seat expiring that year, a new three-year seat and a seat with a two-year term, with the full cycle starting as of the 2015 general election.
As of 2024, members of the Chesterfield Township Committee are Mayor Matthew Litt (D, term on committee and as mayor ends December 31, 2023), Deputy Mayor Denise E. Koetas-Dale (D, term on committee ends 2026; term as deputy mayor ends 2024), Belinda Blazic (R, 2024), Shreekant Dhopte (D, 2025) and Rebecca Hughes (R, 2026).
After the November 2016 general election ended with a tie between Democrat Rita Romeu and Republican Ron Kolczynski who both had 1,289 votes for the second of two township committee seats, a judge in January 2017 decided that Romeu won the race as she was entitled to two additional votes that had not been counted in November.
