Mansfield was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships. Portions of the township were taken to form Fieldsboro (March 7, 1850, within township; became fully independent c. 1894), Bordentown Township (March 8, 1852) and Florence Township (March 7, 1872).

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Mansfield Township is governed under the Township form of government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The Township Committee is comprised of five members who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor. Legislative and executive powers of the township are exercised by the Township Committee as a whole, with the mayor presiding over meetings and voting as a member of the committee.
As of 2024, members of the Mansfield Township Committee are Mayor Marcial Mojena (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2024; term as mayor ends 2024), Deputy Mayor Brian Sisz (R, 2024), Tim Boyd (R, 2025), Valerie Jennings (R, 2026), and Kelly Stobie (R, 2026).


==== Local elections ====
In 2020, independent candidates Dan Golenda and Bob Tallon ran a successful write-in campaign against incumbent Republicans Janice DiGiuseppe and her running mate Efthimios "Paul" Tsiknakis, winning 4,812 total votes versus 4,262. This was in response to a public outcry of Mansfield losing an affordable housing litigation suit, and the then-committee voting several actively-farmed parcels as "redevelopment" to cover financial issues in the township, which started a warehousing boom in the community. The following year 2021, Marcial Mojena (R) and Paul 'Brian' Sisz (R) ran a similarly successful "No More Warehouses" campaign. In 2022, the committee adopted an ordinance to remove warehousing as a permitted use in all zones of the township, until the impact from the currently approved warehouses in the township could be evaluated.
Janice A. DiGiuseppe resigned in August 2015, citing personal reasons for leaving office after five years. The following month, the council selected Laverne Cholewa from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the vacancy. In November 2015, Cholewa was elected to serve the two years remaining on the term of office previously held by DiGiuseppe.
In 2023, Republicans Valerie Jennings and Kelly Stobie were elected, returning the Township Committee to 5-0 Republican control.


==== 2013 revaluation issues ====
After a property revaluation was completed in 2013 and based on changes in tax levies by the municipality and the local school districts, the property tax rate increased by almost 50%, from $2.01 per $100 in assessed value in 2012 to $2.93 in 2013. A group of residents has complained to the New Jersey Division of Taxation, claiming that home values had been calculated incorrectly and arbitrarily, showing data that a sample of smaller homes saw taxes drop 8% while taxes on larger homes increased by 10%. The Mansfield Township tax assessor denied the claims and responded that the revaluation complied with all state legal requirements.
