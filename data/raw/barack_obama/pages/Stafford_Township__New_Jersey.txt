Stafford Township is a township situated on the Jersey Shore in southern Ocean County, within the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 28,617, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 2,082 (+7.8%) from the 26,535 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,003 (+17.8%) from the 22,532 counted in the 2000 census.
Stafford Township is the gateway to the resort communities on Long Beach Island, with Route 72 providing the sole road access to the island, ending in Ship Bottom as it crosses Barnegat Bay via the Manahawkin Bay Bridge (formally known as the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge). The Garden State Parkway and U.S. Route 9 pass through the township and provide access to Route 72.


== History ==
Stafford Township was formed by royal charter on March 3, 1750, from portions of Shrewsbury Township, while the area was still part of Monmouth County. It was incorporated as one of New Jersey's first 104 townships by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, and became part of the newly formed Ocean County on February 15, 1850. Portions of the township were taken to form Union Township (March 10, 1846, now Barnegat Township), Eagleswood Township (March 17, 1874), Long Beach City Borough (September 19, 1894, now Surf City) and Long Beach Township (March 23, 1899). The township was named after Staffordshire, England.
Historically, Stafford Township was a rural area, with the notable exception of the downtown hub of Manahawkin. Significant growth began in the 1950s with the development of resort communities like Beach Haven West and Ocean Acres. These developments coincided with the completion of the Garden State Parkway and the expansion of Route 72, which formerly ran along the two-lane Bay Avenue.
While growing quickly, development was still sparse. Route 72 was still mostly wooded, aside from several car dealerships, gas stations, a drive-in movie theater, and the Manahawkin Executive Airport. The pace of development increased during the 1980s with new residential projects, including the expansion of Beach Haven West and Ocean Acres, transforming the area from seasonal vacation homes to year-round residences. This period also saw the establishment of Stafford Square, the township's first major shopping center. The Manahawkin Airport closed in the early 1990s to make way for commercial developments, including a Walmart and Pathmark. However, part of the runway was left intact until the 2000s, when the St. Mary's of the Pines Catholic Church and All Saints Regional Catholic School were built on the land.
Stafford Township celebrates its history and community spirit through an annual Founders Day event held each June. Originating in 1964 as part of New Jersey’s 300th anniversary celebrations, Founders Day has grown into a vibrant tradition featuring a hometown parade, pie-eating contests, inflatable rides, the Miss Stafford, Jr. Miss Stafford, Little Miss Stafford, and Little Town Crier pageants, and concludes with a fireworks display.
In July 2021, the township buried a 50-year time capsule, which will be opened in 2070. Stafford Township officials included various items, and residents submitted memorabilia from 2020 to give future residents a glimpse of life in Stafford Township during the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Stafford Township is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Small Municipality form of New Jersey municipal government. The township is one of 18 (of the 564) municipalities statewide that use this form of government, which is only available to municipalities with fewer than 12,000 residents at the time of adoption. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the six-member Township Council. The Mayor and Council members are elected to three-year terms on a concurrent basis in partisan elections. The mayor can vote on all issues. The seven-member governing body is empowered to enact local ordinances, levy municipal taxes and conduct the community's affairs. In a November 2010 referendum, voters approved a change to shift from nonpartisan elections held in May to partisan elections held as part of the November general election, with costs savings from the shift cited as the primary justification for the move.
As of 2024, the mayor of Stafford Township is Republican Robert E. Henken, who was appointed to serve an unexpired term of office ending December 31, 2024. Members of the Stafford Township Council are Council President Lisa D. Mower, Steven Esposito, Paul Krier, Owen LaRocca (appointed to serve an unexpired term), Amy Otte and Thomas N. Steadman; all are Republicans and all are serving terms which end concurrently in 2024.
After Greg Myhre stepped down from office to take a seat in the New Jersey General Assembly in January 2024, councilmember Robert Henken was appointed to fill his seat as mayor; in turn, Owen LaRocca was appointed to fill Henken's vacant council seat.
In November 2022, Steven Esposito was elected to fill a vacant council seat. Thomas Bresnahanhad been appointed the previous August to fill the seat after Anthony Guariglia had resigned.
