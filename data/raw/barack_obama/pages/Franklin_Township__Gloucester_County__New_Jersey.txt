== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Franklin Township is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor.
As of 2025, the Franklin Township Committee is comprised of Mayor John "Jake" Bruno (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2027; term as mayor ends 2025), Deputy Mayor Tim Doyle (R, term on committee ends 2026; term as deputy mayor ends 2025), Mark Fiorella (R, 2026), Jonathan Keen (R, 2025) and Mike Marsh (R, 2025).
In January 2020, Timothy Doyle was chosen from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that had been held by Leah Vasallo until she resigned from office the previous month.
Republican Heather Flaim was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2018 that became vacant following the death of Ed Leopardi in September 2016; a judge ruled in May 2017 that Flaim could take the seat in a ruling in a case in which the local Democratic municipal committee claimed that it had submitted a list of three candidates to succeed Leopardi, which the township claims it never received. Flaim won a full three-year term in the November 2017 general election, while Democrat Charles F. Pluta was elected to serve the balance of Leopardi's term of office.

== Education ==
Franklin Township Public Schools serve students in pre-kindergarten through sixth grade. As of the 2022–23 school year, the district, comprised of three schools, had an enrollment of 1,338 students and 116.2 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.5:1. Schools in the district (with 2022–23 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Mary F. Janvier Elementary School with 555 students in grades K-2, 
Main Road School with 392 students in grades 3-4 and 
Caroline L. Reutter School with 379 students in grades 5-6. Students from Newfield attend the Franklin Township district's schools as part of a sending/receiving relationship in which Newfield accounts for about 100 of the nearly 1,400 students in the district.
For seventh through twelfth grades, students attend the Delsea Regional School District, which serves students from both Elk Township and Franklin Township. Students from Newfield attend the district's schools as part of a sending/receiving relationship begun in September 2010 after Newfield ended its prior relationship with the Buena Regional School District. Schools in the district (with 2022–23 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Delsea Regional Middle School with 518 students in grades 7-8 and 
Delsea Regional High School with 1,074 students in grades 9-12. The seats on the high school district's nine-member board of education are allocated to the constituent municipalities based on population, with seven seats assigned to Franklin Township.
The New Jersey Department of Education considered a vote by the Franklin Township Board of Education in June 2010 requesting that the district withdraw from the Delsea Regional School District, which would require that the Delsea region be dissolved as about 80% of the regional district's students come from Franklin. With the withdrawal of Franklin Township, two options being considered were to either have Franklin and Elk Townships create a new regional district with Newfield students attending on a send-receive basis, or having Franklin Township establish its own Pre-K–12 district which would receive students from both Elk Township and Newfield.
Students from across the county are eligible to apply to attend Gloucester County Institute of Technology, a four-year high school in Deptford Township that provides technical and vocational education. As a public school, students do not pay tuition to attend the school.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Camden operates St. Michael the Archangel Regional School in Clayton; Nativity Church in Franklinville is one of the sending parishes. Our Lady of Mercy Academy is a college preparatory, all-girls Catholic high school founded in 1962 by the Daughters of Our Lady of Mercy.
