== Politics ==
From 1932 to 1996, Jackson County favored the Democratic nominee in all but four presidential elections, all of which were Republican landslides. Since 2000, the county has voted Republican in every election. George W. Bush won the county by somewhat modest margins in both 2000 and 2004, and John McCain defeated Barack Obama by slightly over 4% in 2008. In 2012, Mitt Romney defeated Obama by over 14%. This was a portent, as in 2016, Donald Trump nearly tripled Romney's margin of victory, defeating Hillary Clinton in the county by over 38%. Trump was the first Republican to win at least 60% of the county vote since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. His margin of victory fell slightly in 2020, but he increased his vote share to nearly 68%, the best vote share for any Republican in the county since Warren G. Harding. Trump's vote share increased further to nearly 70% in 2024 and his margin of victory increased to 42%, the highest for a Republican presidential candidate since Harding in 1920.
