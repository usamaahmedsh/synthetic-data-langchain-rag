This amounts to 63% of its general revenue and based on the 2010 Census, equates to $683.11 for each of its 3,275 residents. The local prosecutor was criticized for this, because he is a lawyer for the Michael Brown family, and alleges overzealous enforcement by the Ferguson Police Department.
The report of the US Attorney General concerning the Ferguson Police Department prompted protests in Pine Lawn, Missouri as well. The use of police departments as revenue generation units may be widespread.

Caldwell was himself convicted and sentenced to prison for extortion in 2015.
