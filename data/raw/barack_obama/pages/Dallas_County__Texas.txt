== Government and politics ==


=== Government ===

Dallas County, like all counties in Texas, is governed by a commissioners' court. This court consists of the county judge (the chairperson of the court), who is elected county-wide, and four commissioners who are elected by the voters in each of four precincts.
The Commissioners' Court is the policy-making body for the county; in addition, the county judge is the senior executive and administrative position in the county. The Commissioners' Court sets the county tax rate, adopts the budget, appoints boards and commissions, approves grants and personnel actions, and oversees the administration of county government. Each commissioner supervises a Road and Bridge District. The Commissioners' Court approves the budget and sets the tax rate for the hospital district, which is charged with the responsibility for providing acute medical care for citizens who otherwise would not receive adequate medical services.

The Parkland Health & Hospital System (Dallas County Hospital District) operates the Parkland Memorial Hospital and various health centers.
The Commissioners' Court meets the first and third Tuesday at the Commissioners' Courtroom located in the Dallas County Administration Building at 411 Elm St., corner of Elm and Houston streets. The building was the headquarters of the Texas School Book Depository Company until 1970. In 1963 assassin Lee Harvey Oswald shot President John F. Kennedy from a window located on the sixth floor which today houses the Sixth Floor Museum dedicated to the late president's memory.
Acts of the commissioners court are known as 'court orders'. These orders include setting county policies and procedures, issuing contracts, authorizing expenditures, and managing county resources and departments. Most importantly, the commissioners court sets the annual tax rate and the budget for Dallas County government and the courts. The commissioners also set the tax rate and budget for the Dallas County Hospital District which operates Parkland Hospital.
The commissioners court has direct control over all county offices and departments not otherwise administered by a county elected official. Those departments include Dallas County Elections, Health and Human Services, Facilities Management, Parks and Open Space Program, I.T. Services, Homeland Security and Emergency Services, among others. Through their budget making powers, the commissioners exercise indirect control over the District Attorney's office, Sheriff, District Clerk, County Clerk and County Treasurer. The commissioners also set the budget for each of the District, County, and Justice courts.
Dallas County employs a commissioners court administrator who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the commissioners court and implementing the Dallas County Master Plan and the directives of the commissioners court. The current commissioners court administrator is Darryl Martin who was hired by the commissioners in 2008.

=== Politics ===
Dallas County was one of the first areas of the South to break away from a Solid South voting pattern. This coincided with the county's explosive postwar growth. It swung from a 13-point win for Democrat Harry Truman in 1948 to a 23-point win for Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952. For most of the second half of the 20th century, it would be one of the most conservative urban counties in the nation, voting for the GOP in every presidential election until 2008. The lone exception was when Texas native Lyndon B. Johnson successfully ran for a full term as president on the Democratic ticket in 1964.
In the 2004 election, Democrats won their first countywide administrative office since 1986 by electing Lupe Valdez to the office of Dallas County Sheriff. The last Democratic countywide administrator was D. Connally elected County Surveyor prior to the office's abolition. Democrats also won three district court benches in 2004. Two years later, Democrats swept every contested countywide race, including those for County Judge, District Clerk, County Clerk, District Attorney, County Treasurer, as well as every contested judicial seat.
Since the 1990s, Dallas County has voted more Democratic than the state of Texas as a whole. It swung from an 18-point win for George H. W. Bush in 1988 to only a two-point win in 1992. In 1996, Bill Clinton became only the fourth Democrat since Truman to win 40 percent of the vote. Former Governor of Texas George W. Bush earned relatively narrow wins in 2000 and 2004, even as he easily carried the state. This trend amplified in 2008 when the county swung dramatically to Barack Obama, whose coattails allowed Democrats to win the remaining Republican-held judicial seats.
Since the 2010s, Dallas County has been one of the most Democratic-leaning counties in Texas. In 2012, Obama won Dallas County by virtually the same margin as he had done in 2008. In 2016, Hillary Clinton increased the Democratic margin of victory even further. She became the first Democrat to win 60% of the county's vote since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, while Donald Trump became the first Republican not to win 40% of the vote in the county since 1992. Joe Biden managed an even larger win in 2020.
In 2024, though Trump did not carry the county, he received his best-ever vote share, with 38%. This was likely due to his increase in Hispanic support, which was 55% in the state of Texas compared to Kamala Harris’s 44%.

Dallas County has had three openly LGBT elected county officials: Lupe Valdez, elected Sheriff in 2004 and serving until 2017; Jim Foster, elected county judge in 2006, serving one term before defeat in the Democratic primary in 2010; and Gary Fitzsimmons, elected District Clerk in 2006.

=== Primary and secondary schools ===
The following school districts serve Dallas County:

White flight meant the decrease of non-Hispanic white students in Dallas County K-12 school districts from 1997 until the 2014–2015 school year. The number was 138,760 in the former and 61,538 in the latter; during 2014–2015 county charter schools had about 5,000 non-Hispanic white students. In 2016 Eric Nicholson of the Dallas Observer wrote that the bulk of white K-12 enrollment is shifting to more distant suburban areas beyond Dallas County, and that "Teasing out causation is tricky" but that the perception of poverty, which many white families wish to avoid, is tied with race.
Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District formerly served a part of the county. In 2006 WHISD officially merged into DISD.
