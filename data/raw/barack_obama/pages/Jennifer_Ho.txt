From 2010 to 2013, she served as deputy director at the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), overseeing the creation of Opening Doors, the country's first federal plan to end homelessness.

Ho's work has focused on preventing and ending homelessness for families, and the impact homelessness has on health. She has been very involved in "rapid rehousing," a method of helping families leave homeless shelters and become rehoused as soon as possible. Under her administration, HUD has spent nearly $1.5 billion on this initiative, making it "a key tool for reducing homelessness for hundreds and thousands of families."
