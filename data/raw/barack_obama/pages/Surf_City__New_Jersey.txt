Surf City is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore in southern Ocean County, within the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 1,243, an increase of 38 (+3.2%) from the 2010 census count of 1,205, which in turn had reflected a decline of 237 (−16.4%) from the 1,442 counted in the 2000 census. The borough borders the Atlantic Ocean on Long Beach Island.
What is now Surf City was originally formed as Long Beach City borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 19, 1894, from portions of Stafford Township, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day. The borough was renamed Surf City by a resolution of the Borough Council as of May 26, 1899. The name was changed to avoid confusion with other places on the island and along the Jersey Shore.


== History ==
Present-day Surf City was home to one of the earliest big boarding hotels on the Jersey Shore, called the Mansion of Health, one of whose owners was Hudson Buzby. In the 1830s and 1840s, the area surrounding this hotel was called "Buzby's Place". The Mansion of Health burned down in 1874, but some old-timers still call the cove at the foot of South First Street on the bay side "Mansion Cove."
In 1875, the 20 or so permanent residents of the area decided to call the area Long Beach City, even though the area was still part of Stafford Township. In 1894, Surf City was incorporated, changing its name to Surf City in 1899 after the United States Postal Service required a name change before the town could incorporate, preventing it from being confused with Long Branch in Monmouth County.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Surf City is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Surf City is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2025, the mayor of Surf City Borough is Republican Francis R. Hodgson Sr., whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. After serving 46 years on the borough council, Hodgson succeeded Leonard T. Connors Jr., who had served as the state senator from the 9th Legislative District and spent 50 years as mayor. With the death of Tinton Falls mayor Vito Perillo in 2025, Hodgson is currently the oldest incumbent mayor in New Jersey at the age of 92. Members of the Surf City Borough Council are Council President John H. Klose (R, 2024), Peter M. Hartney (R, 2022), William D. Hodgson (R, 2023), John D. McMenamin (R, 2023; appointed to serve an unexpired term), James B. Russell (R, 2024) and Jacqueline L. Siciliano (R, 2022). All of the seats on the borough council have been held by Republicans since Democrat Donald Cummings served on the council in the early 1960s; the last major electoral performance by a Democrat in a borough council election was in 1969 when Hodgson Sr. defeated Cummings' comeback bid by 200 votes.
John D. McMenamin was appointed to fill the council seat expiring in December 2023 that was vacant following the resignation of John G. Hadash III that same month.
In January 2016, John G. Hadash III was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2017 that had been held by Francis R. Hodgson Sr., until he stepped down in January 2016 to take office as mayor. Hadash served on an interim basis until the November 2016 general election, when voters chose him to serve the balance of the term of office.
