== Plot ==
In 2015, The Barden Bellas have been the ICCA National champions for three consecutive years and are now led by senior Beca Mitchell and three-time super senior Chloe Beale.
A national scandal (dubbed "Muffgate") erupts when Patricia "Fat Amy" Hobart accidentally rips her pants in front of U.S. President Barack Obama during his birthday performance at the Kennedy Center, exposing her genitalia and leading to the Bellas' suspension from the ICCAs.
Beca makes a deal that they can be reinstated should they win the A Cappella World Championship. Freshman Emily Junk hopes to follow in the footsteps of her mother, Katherine, by becoming a Bella. She watches an a cappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Beca's boyfriend Jesse Swanson. Jesse's friend Benjamin "Benji" Applebaum, develops a crush on Emily.
The Bellas learn that German powerhouse group Das Sound Machine (DSM) has replaced them on their victory tour and is favorite to win the Worlds. Beca has secretly started an internship at recording studio Residual Heat, which only Jesse knows (and Fat Amy later discovers).
As the Bellas' suspension means they cannot hold auditions, Emily goes directly to their sorority house and sings her unfinished song "Flashlight". They decide she can join; since she came of her own accord, they technically aren't breaking any rules.
The Bellas meet DSM when the latter performs at a car show. DSM leaders Pieter Krämer and Kommissar mock the Bellas. Both groups are invited to a riff-off with the Treblemakers, the Tone Hangers (composed of former Treblemakers, including previous leader Bumper Allen, with whom Amy is in a casual relationship), and the Green Bay Packers.
The Bellas make it to the final two, but lose to DSM when Emily sings "Flashlight", violating the rule of no original songs. Bumper asks Amy on a traditional date and to officially be his girlfriend; she refuses. At a practice performance for the Worlds, the Bellas' set ends in disaster when their pyrotechnics set fire to Cynthia Rose's hair.
Chloe takes The Bellas on a retreat to rediscover their roots and synchronicity, led by former Bella Aubrey Posen. Beca's internship is revealed, and Beca argues with Chloe over her obsession with the group and accuses the other Bellas of not thinking about their futures. She storms off, only to step into one of the camp's bear traps.
Beca apologizes before being saved by Lilly. The Bellas accept that they will go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing "Cups", Beca's audition song for the group.
Amy regrets ending things with Bumper and they reconcile. Beca's boss has been unimpressed with her, so Beca offers to help Emily produce "Flashlight". He likes the result and says he looks forward to working with them.
The senior Bellas graduate and the group heads to Copenhagen for the World Finals. Emily and Benji share a kiss. The Bellas deliver a stripped-down performance ending in a harmonized version of "Flashlight" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. They win. As the senior Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated initiation ceremony, with Amy demonstrating the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase.
As the credits roll, Bumper appears on The Voice and all of the judges turn around. He picks Christina Aguilera to be his coach.

=== Box office ===

In its first five days, the film surpassed the total gross of the original ($115.4 million), and also overtook School of Rock ($131.3 million) for the highest grossing musical-comedy of all-time and the third greatest musical debut ever (behind Beauty and the Beast's $174.8 million in 2017 and The Lorax's $70.4 million in 2012). Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $139.6 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.
In the United States and Canada, Pitch Perfect 2 grossed $4.6 million from Thursday night showings and $28.0 million on its opening day, increasing the opening weekend projections from $40 million to $64 million. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $69.2 million, finishing first at the box office.

The opening weekend audience was 75% female.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 66% based on 216 reviews and an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Pitch Perfect 2 sings in sweet comedic harmony, even if it doesn't hit quite as many high notes as its predecessor." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.
Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: "Reprising the kind of musical performances, campus hijinks, stinging humor and sassy sisterhood put in place by its eminently likeable predecessor, Pitch Perfect 2 remixes the elements and comes up with something even slicker and sharper."
Guy Lodge of Variety called it an "ebulliently entertaining, arguably superior sequel to the 2012 musical comedy hit." Lodge added, "Kay Cannon's script is even lighter on narrative than its predecessor, but fills any resulting void with a concentrated supply of riotous gags, and a renewed emphasis on the virtues of female collaboration and independence." 
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Travers welcomed the addition of Steinfeld, praised Wilson for her continued scene stealing, and said the scenes with Keegan-Michael Key were gold. He reserved his highest praise for Banks, for both her acting and her feature debut as director, praising her for "bringing fizz to the tiredest clichés and reveling in a screen full of musical girl power."
Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a mixed review, saying "Pitch Perfect 2 strains to find some plot conflicts while balancing the line between satire and rousing musical numbers." Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called it "a two-hour lesson in how to act like a frenemy to your alleged friends. And it's not funny enough." David Edelstein of New York Magazine gave a negative review and, despite having reviewed the first film positively, described the sequel as "A Ca-Terrible". Edelstein was critical of the script, noting "there are good ideas that needed another pass", and of Kendrick's performance, saying "I've never seen her so flat-out bad — distracted, depressed, conviction-less"; however, he conceded that the climactic number was excellent.

Rodrigo Perez at IndieWire wrote "The movie's off-color humor also doesn't connect like it once did either. The casual racism, homophobia and sexism might be tolerable if any of it was remotely funny, but none of it is."
Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast liked the film but was critical of the "tone-deaf racial jokes", particularly the casual racism in the subplot about Flo, a senior Bella singer from Guatemala. He also did not find the racially charged jokes from the commentators funny.

== Sequel ==

On April 11, 2015, a month before the release of Pitch Perfect 2, it was announced that Rebel Wilson would return for a third film, although she stated that she did not know if Anna Kendrick or any of the other cast members would also be reprising their roles. She added that she would be "up for a Fat Amy spin-off," although nothing had yet been confirmed. Director, star, and producer Elizabeth Banks acknowledged the possibility of a third film, saying, "I will say, it would be disingenuous to say that no one's talking about a Pitch Perfect 3; the possibility of it. We are really focused on getting as many butts in seats for this one. If fans embrace it, we are going to seriously think about what the continuing journey would look like, but we don't know what that is yet".
On June 10, 2015, a third film was officially confirmed, with Kay Cannon returning to write the script. Several days later it was announced both Kendrick and Wilson would reprise their roles, and later Brittany Snow was also confirmed to return. Banks returned to produce, but in June 2016 it was announced she would not be directing the film.
The film was originally slated for a July 21, 2017 release, and was later pushed back to August 4, 2017, before moving back to the July 21 slot. In May 2016, it was moved again, this time being pushed back to December 22, 2017.
