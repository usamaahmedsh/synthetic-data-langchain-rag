Landing with the reserve company of an assault battalion, Cire led his platoon forward in rear of an assault company and observing that it was disorganized alerted his men to pass through it. Moving his platoon to the front he directed the annihilation of the hostile personnel in three pill boxes and in numerous fire trenches. When fire from an enemy emplacement pinned down his platoon, Cire returned to the beach and obtaining a tank, guided the armored vehicle by walking before it in the face of hostile fire.
