Haskell County is a county located in the southeast quadrant of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. As of the 2020 census, its population was 11,561. Its county seat is Stigler. The county is named in honor of Charles N. Haskell, the first governor of Oklahoma.


== History ==
The area now comprising Haskell County was created at statehood primarily from the former Sans Bois County of the Choctaw Nation in Indian Territory. Sans Bois County was part of the Moshulatubbee District, one of three administrative super-regions comprising the Choctaw Nation. Small portions of present-day Haskell County fell within Gaines County and Skullyville County, Choctaw Nation.
In 1908, county voters picked Stigler over Keota and Whitefield as the county seat.
Underground coal mining was undertaken here in the early 20th century, creating jobs and attracting railroad construction to southern Haskell County. The San Bois Coal Company built more than 400 company houses in McCurtain and Chant (two towns that eventually merged into one) for their miners. In 1912, a large, underground explosion rocked the Number Two mine at McCurtain, killing 73 miners and bankrupting the San Bois Company. The McCurtain disaster and the declining demand for coal in the 1920s halted underground coal mining in the county.
Strip mining continued. The Lone Star Steel Company became the county's leading coal producer. Haskell County was the source of 20% of Oklahoma's coal production between 1950 and 1980.
Agriculture was the most important component of the county economy in the early 20th century. Cotton was the most important crop, followed by corn and oats. The collapse of cotton prices and the Great Depression caused a drop in population, as well as farm acreage. In 1934, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration helped over 85% of Haskell County's population. Ranching supplanted farming, which was forced to diversify. By 1964, livestock accounted for about 70% of the county's revenues.


== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 625 square miles (1,620 km2), of which 49 square miles (130 km2) (7.8%) are covered by  water. The county elevation varies because of the Sans Bois Mountains in the southern part of the county from 500 to 1,500 feet (150 to 460 m). The relatively large water area results from the presence of Eufaula Lake and the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. The South Canadian River forms the northern border with McIntosh and Muskogee counties before draining into the Arkansas River at the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. The river forms the northeastern border with Sequoyah County.

Unlike other Native-administered counties, however, the rightward shift only increased after the 2004 election, with the GOP hitting well over 70% of the vote in the county in the Barack Obama era and topping out with 83.1% for Donald Trump in 2020.

== Haskell County Courthouse ==
Stigler is home to the Haskell County Courthouse, which has become notable for erecting marble statues of the Ten Commandments and the Mayflower Compact on the front lawn (see Separation of church and state in the United States). In the seventh commandment, the word "adultery" is misspelled.
A unanimous federal appeals court ruled that county commissioners in Haskell County unconstitutionally sought to promote their personal religious beliefs by erecting a Ten Commandments monument on the front lawn of the county's courthouse. The decision by the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals comes in a challenge filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Oklahoma on behalf of a local resident.
After the court decision, the marble statue was moved about 600 feet east to private property. Therefore, the statue was still displayed on the main street, available to anyone who desired to view and read the information.
