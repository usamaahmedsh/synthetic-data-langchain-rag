Cinnaminson Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Cinnaminson Township borders the Delaware River, and is an eastern suburb of Philadelphia. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 17,064, an increase of 1,495 (+9.6%) from the 2010 census count of 15,569, which in turn reflected an increase of 974 (+6.7%) from the 14,595 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.
Cinnaminson was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 15, 1860, from portions of Chester Township (now known as Maple Shade Township). Portions of the township were taken to form Delran Township (February 12, 1880), Riverton (December 18, 1893) and Palmyra (April 19, 1894).


== History ==
Cinnaminson was formed by resolution in 1860 from a section of Chester Township. Part of this resolution reads, "The inhabitants of the township of Chester having become so numerous that it is impracticable for them to meet with convenience and good order in one assembly... the Township shall be divided."
The name "Cinnaminson" is said to derive from the Lenape Native American word "Senamensing," which means "sweet water". Alternatively, the name may derive from Native American words meaning "stone island".
