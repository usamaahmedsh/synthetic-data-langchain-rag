== Government ==


=== Local government ===

Magnolia is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the state's most common form of government. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Magnolia is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2023, the mayor of the Borough of Magnolia is Democrat BettyAnn Cowling-Carson, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Magnolia Borough Council are Council President Mary F. Martz (D, 2023), Paula Bonamassa (D, 2025), Anthony DePrince III (D, 2025), Shawn Parker (D, 2024), Steve Whalen (D, 2023) and Shelley Wilson (D, 2024; elected to serve an unexpired term).
In February 2022, the borough council appointed Shelley Wilson to fill the seat expiring in December 2024 that had been held by Richard Krause until he resigned from office the previous month shortly after beginning his new council term. Wilson will serve on an interim basis until the November 2022 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the remainder of the term of office.
