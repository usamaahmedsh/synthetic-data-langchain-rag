== Government ==


=== Local government ===
New Milford is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members, who are elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in November. The borough form of government used by New Milford is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2023, the mayor of New Milford is Democratic Michael J. Putrino, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the borough council are Council President Frances Randi Duffie (D, 2025), Hedy Grant (D, 2024), Ira S. Grotsky (D, 2023), Lisa Repasky-Sandhusen (D, 2025), Matthew S. Seymour (D, 2023) and Thea Sirocchi-Hurley (D, 2024).
In January 2019, Matthew Seymour was selected from three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipalcommittee to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that was vacated earlier that month when he took office as mayor.
Democrats took control of the council in the November 2012 general election, as incumbent Austin Ashley won reelection while running mate and former council member Michael Putrino was elected again after having served two previous terms of office. Incumbent Republican Howard Berner and running mate Peter Rebsch, a former council member, fell short.
Celeste Scavetta had been appointed by the Borough Council on January 11, 2011, to fill the vacant seat of Ann Subrizi that expired at the end of 2011 when Subrizi was elected as mayor. Peter Rebsch was appointed in June 2011 to fill the vacant seat of Council President Keith Bachmann, who had resigned from office; Rebsch served until November 2011, when voters chose a candidate to fill the balance of Bachmann's term that expired in 2012.
In the November 2011 general election, Democratic incumbent Randi Duffie and newcomers Austin Ashley and Hedy Grant won seats on the council, unseating incumbent Republicans Peter Rebsch and Celeste Scavetta. After counting absentee ballots, Duffie and Grant won the two three-year council seats, edging Republican Scavetta by 10 votes, and started their terms in January 2012. Ashley defeated Darren Drake by 39 votes for the remaining year on the unexpired term of Ann Subrizzi that had been filled on an interim basis by Peter Rebsch, and took office after the election.
The results of the election held November 2, 2010, were a Republican sweep. Republican challenger Ann Subrizi (2,433 votes) ousted 14-year Democratic incumbent, Frank DeBari (2,120). The Republican challengers for Council defeated both incumbents, with Dominic Colucci (2,328 votes) and Diego Robalino (2,285) unseating Democrats Michael J. Putrino (2,210) and Arthur E. Zeilner (2,115). These result gave the Republicans a 4–1 margin, with Ann Subrizi's seat on the Council left vacant.
