DePue (the boat racing capital of the world) is a village in Bureau County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,633 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area.


== History ==
DePue, originally called Trenton, was established in 1853. The present name refers to an early French fur trader by the name of De Pue. The site had long been used as a port and ice harvesting center on the Illinois River. In 1905, the Mineral Point Zinc Company started a plant to produce slab zinc for automobile and appliances in DePue, taking advantage of the nearby coalfields and trained labor force of the LaSalle-Peru zinc processing center. The plant was shortly after acquired by New Jersey Zinc and finally closed in 1990.

== Lake DePue ==
The lake and adjacent park feature wildlife and recreation. The American Power Boat Association (APBA) and the DePue Men's Club (a social and volunteer organization) host a weekend of boat racing on Lake DePue. The event draws spectators from across the country and brings entertainment and food vendors to the lakeside park. Barack Obama visited when he was an Illinois legislator. In a January 16, 2011, news story featured in the online edition of the Peoria Journal Star, Associated Press reporter Tammy Webber reported that the oxbow lake, surrounded by a Superfund site, is polluted by high levels of metals such as zinc, lead, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium because of the smelting activity that takes place there for the automotive and appliance industries, chiefly by New Jersey Zinc and Mobil Chemical. The village is urging Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan to investigate whether the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, which has oversight over the case, is pushing the companies hard enough. This is important because the town alleges the companies and the IEPA have not done enough to combat the pollution that has made the lake markedly shallower. This phenomenon could, unless rapidly remedied, soon interfere with the small municipality's efforts to keep its remaining revenue source for most supplemental projects, the competition. The manufacturing jobs have now entirely disappeared.
In the summer of 2012, as a result of both the summer's drought and Lake DePue's pollution, the APBA nearly cancelled its National Championship Races due to the shallow water. In a display of community and hard work, DePue's citizens built a dam at the mouth of the lake and raised the water by using pumps and the lake's springs to the level required for racing in a matter of weeks.
