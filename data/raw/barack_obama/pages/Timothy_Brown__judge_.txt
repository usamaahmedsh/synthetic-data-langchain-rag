He was the 18th chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court (1962–1963), and served a total of 14 years on the court.  Before joining the court, he was executive legal counsel to governors Walter S.

== Biography ==
Born in Madison, Wisconsin, Brown graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and received his law degree from Harvard Law School. During World War I, Brown served in the United States Navy. Brown practiced law in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and served as executive counsel to the Governor of Wisconsin. In 1949, he joined the Wisconsin Supreme Court and in 1962 became chief justice of the court, retiring in 1964.
He became chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court by rule of seniority on May 18, 1962, after the death of Chief Justice Grover L. Broadfoot.  At the time he became chief justice, he was already expected to step down at the end of 1963, when his current term expired. This was due to a 1955 amendment to the state constitution, which set 70 as a mandatory retirement age for state judges.
