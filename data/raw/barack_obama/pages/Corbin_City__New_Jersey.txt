Corbin City is a city in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The city, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley. As of the 2020 United States census, the city's population was 471, a decrease of 21 (−4.3%) from the 2010 census count of 492, which in turn reflected an increase of 24 (+5.1%) from the 468 counted in the 2000 census.
Corbin City was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 11, 1922, from portions of Weymouth Township. The borough was named for 19th-century banking and railroad entrepreneur Austin Corbin.


== History ==
The city has been one of several New Jersey municipalities that have considered consolidation. In 2008, Corbin City announced that it was investigating a prospective merger with neighboring Upper Township, across the county line in Cape May County, citing proximity and that Corbin City's children already attend Upper Township schools. There are no municipalities within New Jersey that have incorporated lands within multiple counties, and by 2010 Cape May County's Board of Chosen Freeholders objected to the plan, citing an analysis that the added costs of serving Corbin City would exceed revenues.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 8.97 square miles (23.24 km2), including 7.70 square miles (19.94 km2) of land and 1.28 square miles (3.3 km2) of water (14.23%).
Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Buck Hill and Rock Point.
The city borders the municipalities of Egg Harbor Township and Estell Manor in Atlantic County; and Upper Township in Cape May County.

All of the city is included either in the state-designated Pinelands area (which includes portions of Atlantic County, along with areas in Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties) or in the Pinelands National Reserve.
