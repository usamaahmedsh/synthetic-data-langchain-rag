Asa Schoonmaker "Ace" Bloomer (August 15, 1891 – February 21, 1963) was an American politician and lawyer who served as Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives and President Pro Tem of the Vermont Senate.


== Early life ==
Bloomer was born in Proctor, Vermont, on August 15, 1891. He graduated from the University of Vermont in 1913 and received a law degree from Yale Law School in 1916, afterwards practicing law in Rutland County.


== World War I ==
He enlisted in the Army for World War I and received a commission as a Second Lieutenant of Aviation.  Bloomer served in Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas before being discharged in December, 1918.


== Rutland County State's Attorney ==
A Republican, Bloomer was Rutland County State's Attorney from 1935 to 1937.  During his term he garnered nationwide headlines when he indicted Governor Charles M. Smith.  Smith had been President of Rutland's Marble Bank  and was accused with other bank officers of defrauding depositors.  (In May 1932 Smith learned that his bank's bookkeeper had embezzled $251,000. Smith let the bookkeeper resign, did not disclose the theft, and charged the loss against the bank's surplus.  In July 1935, the bookkeeper was named Rutland's Assistant City Treasurer and planned a candidacy for Treasurer.  His political opponents then leaked word of the theft to the press.  In December  1935 Bloomer charged Smith and other bank officers with abetting the theft for failing to inform account holders and authorities.  The bookkeeper was convicted, and the bank Treasurer received a suspended sentence and paid a $400 fine.  Charges against some other officers were dismissed.  Smith was acquitted at trial)
Bloomer also brought charges against a Proctor, Vermont selectman for neglect of duty after the town sided with management and refused to provide emergency aid to the children of striking workers at the Vermont Marble Company.

In 1936 Bloomer ran successfully for the Vermont House of Representatives and served four terms, 1937 to 1945.  In his final term (1943 to 1945) Bloomer served as Speaker of the House.
