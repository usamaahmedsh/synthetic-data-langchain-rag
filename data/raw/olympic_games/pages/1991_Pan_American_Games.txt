The 1991 Pan American Games, officially known as the XI Pan American Games (Spanish: XI Juegos Panamericanos) and commonly known as Havana 1991 (Spanish: La Habana 1991), were held in Havana, Cuba from 2 to 18 August 1991. There were 4,519 athletes from 39 countries of the PASO community, with events in 33 different sports. The main stadium was the Estadio Panamericano, a multi-use stadium in Havana that holds 50,000 people.


== Host city election ==

Havana was the only non-withdrawn bid to host the 1991 Pan American Games. At the Pan American Games (ODEPA) Assembly, from November 12 to 14, 1986, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Mar del Plata withdrew its bid, leaving Havana as the winner to host the Games. London, Ontario, Canada also submitted a bid, but withdrew from the bid process due to the federal government prohibiting all funding from any international multi-sport events (aside from the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics).
