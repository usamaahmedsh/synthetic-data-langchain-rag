A large number of people from Ireland have competed at the Olympic Games for a country other than Ireland. Given the size of the Irish diaspora, particularly Irish Americans and the Irish migration to Britain, it was common for such emigrants to represent their adopted nations. The first independent Irish team at the Olympics appeared in the 1924 Paris Games, with Irish athletes previously competing for Great Britain.

NB: This list excludes people who identify as Northern Irish and have competed for Great Britain at the Olympics, Northern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom.
