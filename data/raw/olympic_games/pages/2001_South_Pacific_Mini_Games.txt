The 2001 South Pacific Mini Games, officially known as the VI South Pacific Mini Games, were the sixth edition of the South Pacific Mini Games for nations and territories in the Pacific region that was held in Kingston, Norfolk Island from 3 to 14 December 2001. A total of 18 Pacific Games associations competed in 10 sports and 97 events. It was also the largest international multi-sport event (or sport event as a whole) to be staged in Norfolk Island. The opening and closing ceremonies were held at the Norfolk National Stadium, the main stadium of the event.
It was the first time that the South Pacific Mini Games were held in Norfolk Island. It was also the second time a territory had hosted the games, second after the previous host, American Samoa, in 1997.
All member associations of the Pacific Games Council participated in the event, with the exceptions of Marshall Islands, Tokelau, Tuvalu, and Wallis and Futuna, who didn't send a team.
The final medal tally was led by Fiji with 27 golds and 49 medals overall. French Polynesia was second by both respects, 22 and 45, while New Caledonia finished third with 20 golds and 52 most overall medals.
