The 141st IOC Session was an IOC Session that was held in Mumbai, India from 15 to 17 October 2023.


== Bidders ==
Mumbai stood as the only bidder to host the session. The IOC membership approved Mumbai's application during the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. This marked the second time an IOC Session was held in India. The 86th IOC Session in 1983 was held in New Delhi. Due to several problems related to Indian Olympic Association, the session was delayed to October 2023.


== Agenda ==
Several items were on the agenda during the three-day IOC Session. The host city for the 2030 Winter Olympics was initially going to be selected at this session, but the IOC pushed that date back to 2024. 


=== Optional Sports for 2028 Summer Olympics ===
The IOC added five new sports for the program of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. 
In August 2022, it was confirmed that nine sports had bid to be included in the games, with presentations made later that month. They were:

Cricket (International Cricket Council)
Break-dancing (World DanceSport Federation)
Baseball/softball (World Baseball Softball Confederation)
Flag Football (International Federation of American Football)
Lacrosse (World Lacrosse)
Karate (World Karate Federation)
Kickboxing (World Association of Kickboxing Organizations)
Squash (World Squash Federation)
Motorsport (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile)
In October 2023, it was announced that the LA28 Olympic Organizing Committee announced that 5 sports were officially proposed to the IOC for the 2028 games, those being Flag Football, Cricket, Lacrosse, Squash, and Baseball/Softball. On October 16, the IOC membership approved the inclusion of the additional sports.

== Attendance of Canadian IOC members ==
IOC member Tricia Smith and honorary IOC member Richard Pound are both Canadian citizens holding Canadian passports. Following the 2023 Canada–India diplomatic crisis, India announced that it would not grant visas to Canadian citizens after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged Indian government involvement in the murder of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was a Canadian citizen. The IOC confirmed that they were following up on the situation concerning visas for Canadian citizens.
