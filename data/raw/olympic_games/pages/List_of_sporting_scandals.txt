The scheme was allegedly organized by a number of players plus defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, with the acquiescence of head coach Sean Payton. Shortly after the investigation came to light, Williams was accused of running similar schemes while he was defensive coordinator of the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans and Washington Redskins, as well as the head coach of the Buffalo Bills. The league suspended Williams indefinitely and Payton for one year and suspended the Saints' general manager and another assistant for parts of the 2012 season.

== Gliding scandals ==
During the 2020 Women's World Gliding Championships at Lake Keepit, Australia, the home team captain Terry Cubley (Executive Officer of the GFA) was charged with unsporting behaviour for hacking the official tracking system to bypass the mandatory 15 minute delay and forward real time competitors' positions to his team, granting a tactical advantage. An investigation revealed that Matt Gage had been closely involved with the developers of the tracking system, and was aware of an undocumented back door that allowed the team captain (Terry Cubley) to bypass the 15 minute delay. This real-time information was relayed by the team captain over the radio to the Australian pilots. This was the first time in the sport's history that an entire team had been penalised for unsporting behaviour, with the Competition Director applying a penalty of 25 points per pilot per day. Controversially the pilots involved were spared disqualification only receiving a relatively trivial points reduction (compared to a competing pilot who was disqualified for infringing airspace earlier in the competition). Following a subsequent GFA investigation two of the Australian Team admitted to cheating and the GFA made a formal apology to the FAI and the wider gliding community. Terry Cubley was removed from his role as Vice President of the IGC, but chose to remain as Executive Officer of the GFA . The pilots involved chose to appeal against this decision, resulting in the longest and most comprehensive investigation in the FAIs history. The final judgement  described the actions of the pilots as ‘reprehensible’, increased the penalty to disqualification and removed their flights from the competition record. The Appeal Tribunal also recommended the FAI to take further disciplinary action against those involved. Following the Tribunals verdict Lisa Turner (the Australian pilots’ representative to the tribunal) issued a press release re-iterating their denial of cheating, accused the tribunal of bias against the Australian team and announced a further appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS.
