Marion County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 56,205 and its county seat is Fairmont. The county was named in honor of General Francis Marion (ca. 1732–1795), known to history as "The Swamp Fox". Marion County comprises the Fairmont, WV Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the larger Morgantown–Fairmont, WV Combined Statistical Area.


== History ==
The Adena and successor Hopewell cultures flourished in the area at one time. The region which includes the land now known as Marion County was sparsely occupied by Native Americans, if at all, in the late 18th century. Like much of the Ohio Valley, it had been depopulated by the Iroquois during the later Beaver Wars (1670–1700). Only a few abortive attempts to start European settlements on the Monongahela River or its branches (including one which gave its name to Dunkard Creek) are known prior to the French and Indian War. It was not until 1772 that any permanent settlements were made in this region.
Marion County was created by an act of the Virginia Assembly on January 14, 1842, from parts of Monongalia and Harrison counties. It was named after General Francis Marion, of American Revolutionary War fame, known to history as "The Swamp Fox".
Starting with the great flood on Monday, April 5, 1852 was an eventful year in Marion County's history. Heavy rains the day before caused the Monongahela and West Fork Rivers to rise at rate of 5 feet per hour until Tuesday afternoon, when the water reached 43 feet above its normal level. The greatest damage was sustained on the West Fork, where over 40 houses and buildings were swept away and floated past Fairmont. The flood damaged the railroad, which was in the final stages of being completed. By June 23 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was completed, connecting Fairmont to the west and to large cities in the east like Baltimore. The railroad required the building of a bridge to cross the Monongahela River about 1 mile west of Fairmont. That was achieved by building a massive iron bridge spanning 650 feet and lifted 35 feet above the water.
The third major event of the year 1852 was the completion of the Fairmont and Palatine suspension bridge, connecting Fairmont to what was then the town of Palatine. The bridge was built under the direction of James L. Randolph, assistant engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, at a cost of about thirty thousand dollars.
Marion was one of fifty Virginia counties which were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. In the months which followed, West Virginia's counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Marion County was divided into seven districts: Fairmont, Grant, Lincoln, Mannington, Paw Paw, Union, and Winfield. In the 1980s, the historic magisterial districts were consolidated into three new districts: Middletown, Palatine, and West Augusta.

== Politics ==
Marion County, like most counties in West Virginia, was historically Democratic, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century. From 1932 to 2008, the county only voted Republican in a presidential election once: for Richard Nixon in 1972 amidst a national landslide. However, like the rest of West Virginia, Marion County has trended heavily Republican in the 21st century, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than most of the state. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney flipped the county for the first time since Nixon's victory, and it has voted Republican in each election since. In 2016, 2020, and 2024, Republican Donald Trump carried Marion County with more than 60% of the vote, with all performances the best ever for any Republican in the county.

== Literary presence ==
In the 1632 series of science fiction novels, the fictional town of Grantville (closely modeled after real-life Mannington) and its environs were part of Marion County until a spacetime anomaly caused by aliens which sent it to 17th-century Thuringia. The county and its institutions are frequently mentioned in the course of the series, and writers interested in the series have held a number of "mini-cons" (miniature science fiction conventions) in Mannington. Flint has said, "The town of Grantville is very closely modeled on the actual town of Mannington. There are rules that I require everyone to follow when they write in the series. One of them is that it if it wasn’t in the town of Mannington in 2000, you can’t have it in Grantville. The one cheat I had to do was that I needed a power plant. The power plant is about 15 miles away, in a town called Granttown, so I just sorta moved it over. That’s the only real cheat.”
