The 2017 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival was held in Erzurum, Turkey from 12 to 17 February 2017.
The event had initially been planned for Sarajevo and East Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
whereas the 2019 EYOF had been planned for Erzurum. In November 2015, the two cities agreed to swap their events, since Sarajevo could not be ready in time, while Erzurum already had facilities in place from the 2011 Winter Universiade.
