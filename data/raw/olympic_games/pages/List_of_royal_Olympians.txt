Multiple members of royal families from various countries, including reigning monarchs, have competed in the Olympic Games. Some, such as Constantine II, Harald V, and Felipe VI, competed before becoming monarchs. Abbie Pratt, Mark Phillips, Charlene, and Iñaki Urdangarin all competed before becoming royalty through marriage.
The tradition of royalty competing in the Olympics dates back to the Ancient Olympics, with leaders including King Varazdat of Armenia, Princess Cynisca of Sparta, and Emperor Nero of Rome all having competed. The first royals to compete in the modern Olympics appeared at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. Abbie Pratt was the first royal to place in the top three at the modern Olympics, winning third place in the women's individual golf competition in 1900. The most recent royal to compete in the Olympics is Saeed bin Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who competed in the 2016 Summer Olympics.
The royal to compete the most times in the Olympics is Hubertus von Hohenlohe, who competed in the Winter Olympics six times. Five Olympians have come from the Spanish royal family, while four have come from the House of Glücksburg; Queen Sofía, who was a reserve member of the 1960 Greek dragon team, is a member of both families. Sheikha Maitha bint Mohammed Al Maktoum was the first woman to represent the United Arab Emirates at the Olympics, while Arunee Bhanubandh was the first woman to represent Thailand at the Olympics. Adegboyega Folaranmi Adedoyin, the son of the Remo Akarigbo William Adedoyin, is the only member of an African royal dynasty to have participated.
