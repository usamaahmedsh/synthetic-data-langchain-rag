Field hockey at the Friendship Games was contested in two events. Men's event took place at the Minor Arena of the Central Dynamo Stadium in Moscow, Soviet Union between 18 and 26 August 1984. Women's event took place in Poznań, Poland between 28 and 30 August 1984.

Eight teams were drawn into two groups.
The host nation, Soviet Union, had two teams in the tournament. However, the Soviet Union "B" team competed "off competition". Despite ending the tournament on the third place, this result was not included in the final rankings. The fourth team (i. e. Zimbabwe) was instead counted as the third place team, etc.
