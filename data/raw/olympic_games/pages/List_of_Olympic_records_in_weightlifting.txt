This is the list of Olympic records in weightlifting. Records are maintained in each weight class for the snatch lift, clean and jerk lift, and the total for both lifts.
The weight classes for men on the Olympic program were adjusted for the 2000 Games, so Olympic records only exist based on the results during and after that. Women's weightlifting made its Olympic debut at the 2000 Games in Sydney, with seven weight classes that have not changed since.
