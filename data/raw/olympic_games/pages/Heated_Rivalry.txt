=== Development ===
Heated Rivalry is based on the Game Changers novel series by Rachel Reid. Jacob Tierney first reached out to Reid in 2023 to discuss the possibility of adapting the books to a limited television series. In January 2025 it was first revealed that the series was in development for Crave. This was confirmed by Reid on her blog. In June 2025, it was officially announced at the Bell Media Upfront that the series would be streamed on Crave. Tierney created, wrote, and directed the series. He also serves as an executive producer alongside Brendan Brady through their production banner Accent Aigu Entertainment. Lori Fischburg is a producer of the series, and Reid is a consulting producer.


=== Casting ===
Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie lead the cast as Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov, respectively, alongside François Arnaud, Robbie G.K., Christina Chang, Dylan Walsh, Sophie Nélisse and Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova.
Williams was the third actor Storrie had a chemistry read with, while Williams read with one other possible actor. When Tierney asked Storrie about his impression, he suggested Williams. Similarly, Williams felt an "inexplicable X-factor" about Storrie, telling Tierney: "The other guy was good, but Connor felt like he was going to pin me down and fuck me."
Arnaud received a call from Tierney personally, asking him if he had received the script yet and telling him: "I didn't write this for you, but I cannot hear anyone else's voice in my head when I read it." Arnaud was surprised, perceiving the script as soft pornography, but changed his mind after understanding how the sex scenes are used to drive the story forward.


=== Filming ===
Filming of the series commenced in April 2025 in Toronto, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec.


== Release ==
The series debuted on Crave with a two-episode premiere on November 28, 2025, followed by weekly episodes, with the finale airing on December 26. In advance of the program's television premiere, the first episode received a preview screening at the 2025 Image+Nation festival on November 23, 2025. The series was released by HBO Max in the United States and Australia, Sky in New Zealand, and Movistar Plus+ in Spain.


== Reception ==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Heated Rivalry holds an approval rating of 88% based on eight critic reviews. Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on four critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.
