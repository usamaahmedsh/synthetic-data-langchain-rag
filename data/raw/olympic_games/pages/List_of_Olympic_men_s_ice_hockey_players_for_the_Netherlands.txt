The Netherlands have participated in one tournament: the 1980 Winter Olympics, where they played five preliminary-round games, and finished ninth of the twelve nations competing.
Four players (Dick Decloe, Corky de Graauw, Jack de Heer, and William Klooster) tied for the lead in goals, with 3 each, while de Graauw had the most assists, 5, and points, 8.
