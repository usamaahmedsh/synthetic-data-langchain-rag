The 2018 Asian Para Games (Indonesian: Pesta Olahraga Difabel Asia 2018, Asian Para Games 2018), officially known as the 3rd Asian Para Games and also known as Indonesia 2018, was a pan-Asian multi-sport event that held from 6 to 13 October 2018 in Indonesia's capital city of Jakarta. The event paralleled the 2018 Asian Games and was held for Asian athletes with disability.
It was the first time Indonesia hosted the games. Events were held in the host city Jakarta and in Bogor Regency of West Java province. The opening ceremony was held at Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium, while the closing ceremony was held at Gelora Bung Karno Madya Stadium next door. The games saw the debut of Bhutan as a participating nation and the introduction of chess to the Asian Para Games' program, with the removal of rowing, sailing, 5 and 7-a-side football, wheelchair dancesport and wheelchair rugby.
China led the medal tally for the third consecutive time. North Korea and South Korea march under the Korean Unification Flag at the opening ceremony and for the first time competed as a unified team in some events. They also won their first medals, one silver and one bronze medal as a unified team. In addition, Philippines and Kuwait won their first ever Asian Para Games gold medals, while Laos and East Timor won their first ever Asian Para Games medals including their first gold medals. There were 16 world, 63 Asian and 246 Asian Para Games records broken during the Games.


== Host city ==
As is the tradition of the event, since 2010, the Asian Para Games are usually held after every Asian Games in the same host country. On 29 February 2016, Indonesia signed the 2018 Asian Para Games host city contract at a ceremony in Jakarta, having confirmed as host city of the event on 21 October 2014 in Incheon, South Korea. A local organising committee named the Indonesia Asian Para Games Organizing Committee (INAPGOC) led by Raja Sapta Oktohari was formed soon after it was appointed host country of the 2018 Asian Para Games for all preparations, opening, organising, and finalizing the implementation of the event.

=== Podium Sweeps ===


== Concerns and controversies ==

Like in the Asian Games, Jakarta was struggling to solve traffic congestion and air pollution problems.
On 8 October 2018, Indonesian judoka Miftahul Jannah was not allowed to compete, after she refused to take off her hijab, a head cover which is prohibited from being worn during competition according to one of International Judo Federation rules which states that the head of the judoka shall not be covered except for bandaging of a medical nature. President of the Indonesian National Paralympic Committee Senny Marbun said the incident occurred because of the committee's negligence and the judo coach appointed by the committee was unaware of the rule and confused over it because of poor English.
On 9 October 2018, Iran beat Iraq in the men's goalball group B match after the referee awarded Iran five penalties. The Iraqi team led 6-5 at half time in the Pool B match, but eventually fell to a 14-9 defeat. Iraqi coach Yosefian Mahmod blamed the referee for the loss saying the referee's decision disadvantaged the team.
