NCAA Season 87 is the 2011–12 season of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) of the Philippines. The host school, University of Perpetual Help System DALTA (UPHSD), led the opening ceremonies at the Araneta Coliseum on July 2, 2011. The men's basketball and the women's volleyball tournaments will be aired by ABS-CBN and Studio 23 for the tenth consecutive season, while the men's basketball events will be simulcast on DZRJ-AM.


== Preseason ==
The Lyceum of the Philippines University became the tenth NCAA team after the league accepted Lyceum as a guest team for the 87 season. Management Committee (MANCOM) chair Mike del Mundo announced that Lyceum completed all of the necessary requirements, including the existence of a high school department. The nonexistence of a high school department two years ago prevented Lyceum from being a guest team; its high school campus in Cavite was accepted and the Lyceum Pirates will field in teams in the mandatory sports. Lyceum paid the league 1.5 million pesos to play in the basketball event, and additional P500,000 bond, as they will have to pay additional fees to play in other events. The Pirates, as a guest team, are eligible to win the championship. Del Mundo also announced the elevation of cheerleading as a regular sport.
Due to the number of competing schools, two days were set aside for the eligibility meeting to ensure no eligibility issues this season.
Boxing's eight-division world champion and Sarangani representative Manny Pacquiao was the keynote speaker during the opening ceremonies on July 2.
