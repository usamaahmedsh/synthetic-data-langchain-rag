The 5th South Pacific Games, also known as Guam 1975 (Chamorro: Guåhån 1975), held in Tamuning and Hagåtña, Guam from 1 to 10 August 1975, was the fifth edition of the South Pacific Games. A total of 1,205 athletes (907 men and 298 women) participated in a rain-affected games which had only one clear day out of the ten scheduled.
The hosting of the event, originally planned for 1974, had met trouble from the start. Carlos Camacho, the Governor of Guam, had been opposed to spending any government money on the games. The impasse was broken in late 1973 and the games were rescheduled for 1975. However, preparations for the events did not progress smoothly, and visiting teams were disappointed with the condition of some of the venues and the scheduling in the middle of the rainy season. The games went ahead despite the logistical problems. Sixteen South Pacific Games records were broken in the track and field athletics events alone.
Guam's basketball gold medal win by the men's team captained by Tony Susuico was the highlight of the Games for the hosting country.
