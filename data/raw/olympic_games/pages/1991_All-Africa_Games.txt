The 5th All-Africa Games (Arabic: الألعاب الإفريقية الخامس), also known as Cairo 1991 (القاهرة 1991), were held from September 20 to October 1, 1991, in Cairo, Egypt. Forty-three countries participated in eighteen sports.
For the first time the Games were held on a four-year cycle as planned. Egypt had hoped to use the Games to showcase the city of Cairo for a possible Olympic bid. The plan fell through after organizational difficulties once again plagued the Games. A stampede of spectators trying to get in to see the Opening Ceremonies got the Games off to a bad start. Many IOC officials and dignitaries were unable to make it into the stadium in the confusion and returned to their hotels to watch the ceremony on television.
African athletes had claimed seven world championships at the previous months World Athletics Championships. Only one, steeplechaser Moses Kiptanui, decided to participate in Cairo.
Highly partisan crowds, which were granted free admission to the events by the Egyptian government, filled the stadiums throughout the games, cheering the home team to another placing at the top of the medals table.
It was Namibia's first participation in the world arena. The team proudly returned with four gold medals, two silver medals and seven bronze medals.
