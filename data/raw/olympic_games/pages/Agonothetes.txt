In ancient Greece, an agonothetes (Ancient Greek: ἀγωνοθέτης, plural agonothetae; ἀγωνοθέται) were the persons who decided the disputes and awarded the prizes in the Panhellenic Games. Alternative names for the same role included athlothĕtae (ἀθλοθέται), particularly in Athens.
At first the person who instituted the games and defrayed the expenses was the agonothetes; but in the great public games, such as the Olympic Games and Pythian Games, these presidents were the representatives of different states, or were chosen from the people in whose country the games were celebrated; thus at the Panathenaic Games at Athens ten athlothetae were elected for four years to superintend the various contests.
In English, by confusion with the native -s plural form, the singular agonothete and plural agonothetes are sometimes encountered.
