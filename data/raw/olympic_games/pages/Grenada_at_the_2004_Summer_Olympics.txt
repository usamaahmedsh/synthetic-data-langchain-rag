Grenada competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's sixth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.
Grenada Olympic Committee sent a total of five athletes (three men and two women), competing only in athletics and swimming. Track runner and world indoor champion Alleyne Francique was appointed by the committee to become the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.  A top favorite in the men's 400 metres, Francique narrowly missed a chance to grab the nation's first ever Olympic medal with a fantastic fourth-place finish.
