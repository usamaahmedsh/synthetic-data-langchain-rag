== Relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright ==

The world-renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright was born in nearby Richland Center, Wisconsin, studied in Madison, Wisconsin, and spent summers and other times near Spring Green with his mother's family, the Lloyd-Joneses of Wyoming Valley. He became identified with Spring Green when he built the first Taliesin studio nearby in 1911 after leaving Oak Park, Illinois, to live with Mamah Borthwick, the wife of an erstwhile client. The disapproval of many area residents only intensified after a disastrous fire and the murder of Borthwick along with her children and several workmen in 1914. On the other hand, some Spring Green craftsmen were among Wright's most trusted and lifelong favorites.
Taliesin was rebuilt again in 1925 and became a local landmark. Wright was buried in the Lloyd-Jones family cemetery next to Unity Chapel near Taliesin and Spring Green from his death in 1959 until 1985, when his remains were controversially reinterred at Taliesin West in Arizona. Growing worldwide appreciation of Wright's legacy has brought increased attention as well as tourism to the Spring Green area. Architects from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, along with Wright-trained architects native to Wisconsin, have designed numerous homes and commercial and civic buildings in Spring Green and the surrounding area.
