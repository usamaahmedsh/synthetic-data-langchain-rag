The Greek city of Heraklion was elected as host city of the third edition of the Mediterranean Beach Games (2023) during the ordinary General Assembly of the ICMG which was held in 2021 via Zoom Video Communications meeting.


== Mascots ==
There are 2 mascots of the games: Ariadne and Minotaur. Four different versions of Ariadne and four different versions of the Minotaur were created and put to a vote. More than 7.700 people participated in the online voting, choosing the final Mascots, between the following four versions of each character:  


=== Ariadne ===
She is a princess of the Cretan Mythology, daughter of King Minos and Pasiphae and the mother goddess in the Minoan pantheon, worshipped as goddess of fertility. She remains still a symbol of the women's independence, strongly represented in many archeological findings.


=== Minotaur ===
The mythical creature with the human body and the head of a bull, is the most iconic symbol of the Minoan Era and the Cretan Mythology. Together with the famous “Horns of Consecration” found in Knossos Palace, they form a global figure of strength and prosperity.The different sports editions
