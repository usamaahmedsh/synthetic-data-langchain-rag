Four cities submitted bids to host the 2006 Asian Games that were recognised by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), all four of which made the OCA Executive Committee's shortlist. OCA selected a host city for the 2006 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea on 12 November 2000, which Doha won. The other shortlisted cities were Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, and New Delhi.
The voting process which involved the 41 members of OCA consisted of three rounds, each round eliminating one of the bidding cities. In the first round, New Delhi was eliminated with just two votes. In the second round, Doha won more than half of the available votes, thus cancelled the need for third round voting.
