It was reported that the Government of Pakistan designated around Rs 2 billion for infrastructure. In July 2020, it was announced that the federal government had set forth more than Rs 3.5 billion for the South Asian Games.
The Pakistan Olympic Association wants to base these Games in Lahore while holding selected sports in other cities which are hubs within the country for each one. Gujranwala is being considered for weightlifting and wrestling competitions while Sialkot and Narowal for volleyball. Faisalabad is under consideration for handball while along with it, Gojra is under consideration for field hockey. Kasur may also be one of the venues. It was also reported that the POA intends to organise the football competition in Karachi, Sindh. In May 2020, Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, expressed hosting events at a gymnasium, despite not being a host city. Syed Aqil Shah, President of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Olympic Association requested that the POA should include Peshawar as one of the host cities for the Games.
"We will place athletes in these sports in these cities which are about two hours away by road from Lahore,” Hasan, Vice President of Olympic Council of Asia added. Pakistan has hosted the South Asian Games twice before – in 2004 and 1989, both times in Islamabad. “We are looking forward to hosting the South Asian Games again. It is our turn and we hope that all countries including India will turn up. We will ensure that security is high and we will be inviting India. I’m very confident that India will accept our invitation".
