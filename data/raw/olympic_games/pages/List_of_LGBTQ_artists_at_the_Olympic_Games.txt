There are 26 Olympic artists who have identified or been identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and/or androgynous, or who had been in a same-sex relationship. The first Olympic Games in which an artist now known to be LGBT+ competed was the 1924 Summer Olympics, with the first LGBT+ Olympic medalist in art winning in 1928. The artistic events were not contested after 1948.
Not including demonstration events, 5 of the LGBT+ artists won a medal, with another receiving an honourable mention but no medals (24% of LGBT+ artists). None won a gold medal.
