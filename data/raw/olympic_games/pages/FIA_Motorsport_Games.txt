The FIA Motorsport Games is a biennial motorsport event administered by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It includes competitions from multiple motorsport disciplines and is entered by national motorsport authorities under their national flags. Each competition awards gold, silver and bronze medals which contribute to an overall medals table determining the winning country of the event. 


== History ==
The first event took place at Vallelunga Circuit in Italy in 2019 and was won by Russia. 
The 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 and 2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On 6 August 2021, the FIA announced that the 2022 event would be hosted at Circuit Paul Ricard in Marseille. It took place on 29–30 October 2022. Russia was banned from participating in the 2022 edition because of its invasion of Ukraine.
From the second edition (2021) onward, the FIA Motorsport Games will be held every two years, as opposed to an annual format. The next edition is scheduled to occur in 2026 at a destination not yet revealed.


== Disciplines and competitions ==
