The 2014 Asian Games (2014년 아시아 경기대회/2014년 아시안 게임), officially known as the 17th Asian Games (제17회 아시아 경기대회/제17회 아시안 게임) and also known as Incheon 2014 (인천2014), were a pan-Asian multi-sport event held from 19 September to 4 October 2014 in Incheon, South Korea. 
On 17 April 2007, Incheon was awarded the right to host the games, defeating Delhi, India and was the third city in South Korea after Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). The games were held from 19 September to 4 October 2014, although several pre-competitive events began between 14 and 19 September 2014. Approximately 9,501 athletes participated in the event which featured 439 events in 36 sports. It was opened by the President of South Korea, Park Geun-hye at the Incheon Asiad Main Stadium.
The final medal tally was led by China, followed by the host South Korea and Japan, while Cambodia won its first-ever Asian Games gold medal. During the games, 14 world and 27 Asian records were broken. Japanese swimmer Kosuke Hagino was announced as the most valuable player (MVP) of the Games. Though there were several controversies, the Games were deemed generally successful with their low hosting cost and with the rising standard of competition amongst the Asian nations.


== Bidding process ==

New Delhi and Incheon submitted their formal bid by the official deadline, 30 June 2005. A 5-member evaluation committee of the Olympic Council of Asia, headed by then vice-president of the association Celso Dayrit inspected New Delhi from 9 to 11 November 2006 and Incheon from 12 to 14 November 2006.

The vote was held on 17 April 2007 in Kuwait City, Kuwait during the 26th Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) General Assembly. During the final presentation before voting, Incheon made a new offer, raising US$20 million in funds to support countries that had yet to win a medal in the Games. It also offered free flight tickets and accommodation to all participants; India, however, made no changes to its offer. All 45 members voted, with voting held in secret ballot. Later that day, it was announced that Incheon won the rights. Though the vote results were not released, it was revealed that Incheon won by 32 to 13.
It was widely felt that Delhi's lack of enthusiasm to host the event was the primary reason for its loss. Then Union Sports Minister of India, Mani Shankar Aiyar, spoke strongly against Delhi hosting the games, arguing that the money allocated by India's government to the sporting event  would be better spent on building facilities for the poor. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president revealed that India's Sports Minister's remarks against hosting the Games was the main reason for New Delhi's loss. The IOA delegation added that the evaluation committee was concerned about pollution and traffic in Delhi. Delhi's offer of US$2 million to each team for games support against Incheon's offer of US$20 million to all 45 nations participating in the event could also have contributed to the defeat. Unlike Delhi, Incheon emphasized the high-tech facilities that would be available to the athletes.

=== Costs ===
The cost of the Games was estimated at approximately US$1.62 billion, with the Korean government and Incheon government covering 19% and 78.9% respectively. Of the total budget, some US$1.39 billion was used for construction of venues and infrastructure, while approximately US$11 million covered the building and maintenance of training grounds. Around US$103 million was allocated for road and transportation projects.
A report in April 2012, however, suggested the city was under financial pressure from increasing debt.

The torch was lit at Dhyan Chand National Stadium in New Delhi, India on August 9, 2014. This marked the first time the torch had been lit outside the host country, and that Weihai, a city in Shandong Province of the People's Republic of China, had hosted the relay, on August 12, 2014.

=== Sports ===
The 2014 Asian Games featured 28 Olympic sports that would be contested at the 2016 Summer Olympics. In addition, eight non-Olympic sports were featured: baseball, ten-pin bowling, cricket, kabaddi, karate, sepak takraw, squash and wushu. The list was finalised on December 9, 2010 at the OCA's executive board meeting in Muscat, Oman. This resulted in dropping six other sports: roller sport, board games (chess, go, xiangqi), cue sports, softball, dancesport and dragon boat, which had been held in previous Games being dropped from the list.  The list was approved on July 13, 2011 during the 30th annual general assembly in Tokyo as softball was incorporated with baseball as one sport while soft tennis came under the discipline of tennis. For the first time compound archery, mixed relay triathlon, and judo team events were introduced.
Changes to the non-Olympic sports featured at the Asian Games were influenced by discussions with organizers, who suggested cricket's removal from the program, as they felt too few countries played it and that they lacked the infrastructure to host it. The OCA disputed the proposed removal of cricket, however, noting its popularity and viewer interest.


=== Participating National Olympic Committees ===
All 45 members of the Olympic Council of Asia participated, including North Korea, which initially threatened to boycott the Games after disputes with South Korea over administrative issues about its delegation of athletes and officials. Saudi Arabia was the sole NOC to not send female athletes to the Games.
Below is a list of all the participating NOCs; the number of competitors per delegation is indicated in brackets.

== Broadcasting ==
Incheon Asian Games Host Broadcasting Management (IHB) (Korean: 인천 아시아 경기대회 주관방송, romanized: Incheon Asia gyeonggi daehoe jugwan bangsong), a joint venture between Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) and Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), launched on 8 May 2013, served as the host broadcaster of the Games. The International Broadcasting Centre was constructed in Songdo Convensia in Yeonsu District.


== Concerns and controversies ==

Before the Games, there were several controversies arose over finances, lack of public interest, transportation shortages for journalists, and several administrative decisions about the opening ceremony and gala show. Organizers were able to generate interest yet a few hundred empty seats remained in the 61,000-capacity stadium at the start of the opening ceremony. Organizers also supplied additional shuttle buses for the late-night shift personnel at the request of various international media organizations.
The OCA and FIBA also failed to compromise on a couple of policies, which caused one team to boycott the event and forced three teams to find replacement players. The Qatari women's basketball team withdrew from the Games when FIBA reaffirmed its ban on hijab, citing safety concerns. Basketball was the only sport to enforce a hijab ban in the Games. On the other hand, OCA policy on naturalised players contradicted the eligibility rules set by FIBA. The OCA disqualified United States-born players Quincy Davis, Andray Blatche, and Aaron Haynes from the Chinese Taipei, Filipino, and South Korean teams.
Several controversies erupted during the Games, mostly surrounding poor officiating. The majority of poor judging allegations occurred in boxing, highlighted by the controversial semifinal loss of Indian lightweight boxer Laishram Sarita Devi against eventual silver medalist Park Jina of South Korea. The judging of the match, Sarita Devi's refusal to accept the bronze medal, and her questionable behavior at the medal ceremony received widespread international attention and sparked numerous debates. The high volume of controversial boxing decisions led to accusations of widespread incompetence and host favoritism against the judges. Criticisms of the new scoring system were also raised. Shooting, and wrestling saw initial rulings by officials being overturned upon appeals.
Some 1,920 fluid samples from 1,600 athletes were tested during the Games. Six athletes tested positive for banned substances and were expelled from the Games, including two gold medalists who were stripped of their medals.
