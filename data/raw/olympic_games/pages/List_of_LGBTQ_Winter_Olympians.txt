There have been 126 modern Winter Olympians who have identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, pansexual, non-binary, queer, or who have openly been in a same-sex relationship, including two who have also competed at the Summer Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympic Games in which an athlete now known to be LGBT+ competed was the 1956 Winter Olympics.
The most decorated able-bodied LGBT+ Olympian is Dutch speed skater Ireen Wüst, with 13 medals including 6 golds; Wüst also holds Olympic records. At least 77 LGBT+ Winter Olympians are medalists (61.11% of LGBT+ Winter Olympians), of which 45 have at least one gold medal (35.71%).
