The 1994 Asian Games (1994年アジア競技大会), also known as the XII Asiad and the 12th Asian Games (第12回アジア競技大会) or simply Hiroshima 1994 (広島1994), were held from October 2 to 16, 1994, in Hiroshima, Japan. It was the first Asian Games in history to be hosted in a non-capital city. The main theme of this edition was to promote peace and harmony among Asian nations.

The games debuted the five Asian former republics of the Soviet Union: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
There were a total number of 6,828 athletes and officials involved, from 42 countries, with a total number of 34 sports. Debut sports at this edition of the Asiad were baseball, karate and modern pentathlon.
