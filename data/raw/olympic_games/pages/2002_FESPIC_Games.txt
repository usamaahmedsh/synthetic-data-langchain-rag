== Symbols ==

The logo of the 2002 FESPIC Games is a traditional Korean design image which resembles both a wave, the symbol of the host city, Busan, an adynamic 'Tae-geuk' mark, and a sportsman racing with a torch. It symbolizes the integration of the Asia-Pacific region through the interaction in sports and the determination of the disabled people to overcome the barriers. The sporty emblem in typical Korean colours and smooth brush strokes represents the desire for a society where those with disabilities and those without live together in harmony.
The mascot of the 2002 FESPIC Games is a turtle named "Gwidong-Ih" (Korean: 귀동이, romanized: Gwidong-I) which literally means a cute child in Korean. The mascot's name also refers to a turtle which is pronounced "gwi" (龜, Korean: 귀, romanized: Gwi) when written in Chinese characters. The use of turtle as the games' mascot is to symbolize the tireless effort of disabled people towards rehabilitation and social participation. Also, the "V" sign showed by the mascot, the initial for "victory", represents the Games as a celebration of victory of Humanity.
