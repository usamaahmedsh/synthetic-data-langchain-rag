The 1971 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games, officially known as the 6th Southeast Asian Peninsular Games, were a Southeast Asian multi-sport event held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 11 to 18 December 1971 with 15 sports featured in the games. In this edition of the games, host country Malaysia joined Singapore in pressuring Thailand to let the SEAP Games Federation expand to include the Philippines and Indonesia, but to no avail. Thai officials felt that such expansion would be contrary to the small family affair they had intended the games to be, and would not be in keeping with the close-neighbours spirit the games was supposed to cultivate. This was the second time Malaysia hosted the games and its first time since 1965. The games was opened and closed by Abdul Halim, the King of Malaysia at the Stadium Merdeka. The final medal tally was led by Thailand, followed by host Malaysia and Singapore.
