Bhutan has participated in every Summer Olympic Games since its debut in 1984. The Bhutan Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 23 November 1983, after being founded earlier that year by former Foreign Minister Lyonpo Dawa Tsering. To get official recognition, Bhutan needed five National Sports Federations which they achieved. Bhutanese Olympians have mostly competed in archery; however, the country has also taken part in events such as shooting, swimming, judo, and athletics. As of 2025, Bhutan has yet to win an Olympic medal. They sent their largest delegation of six archers to the 1984 Games. Their best results were in 2004, when Tashi Peljor and Tshering Choden both reached the round of 32 in the men's and women's archery, respectively.
