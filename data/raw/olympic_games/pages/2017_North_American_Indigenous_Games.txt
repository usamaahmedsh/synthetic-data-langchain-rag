The 2017 North American Indigenous Games were held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada July 16 to 23. The event featured 5,000 athletes aged 13 to 19 in 14 sports.


== Bidding process ==
The 2017 North American Indigenous Games bidding process began on January 12, 2015 and Toronto submitted its bid on January 30, 2015. The bid to host the Games in Toronto, led by the Aboriginal Sport & Wellness Council of Ontario and the Mississaugas of New Credit First Nation, received unanimous support from the NAIG's International Governing Body. The Games was awarded to Toronto on June 26, 2015 after bids from other cities did not materialize.


== Funding ==
The total budget for the Games was $11 million. Three levels of government provided funding to the 2017 North American Indigenous Games. Government of Canada provided $3.5 million through Sport Canada and Government of Ontario provided $3.5 million in matching funding. City of Toronto contributed $400,000 funding. Other major sponsors included Hydro One, Rogers Communication and Unifor.


== Broadcasting rights ==
CBC provided 100 hours of live and on-demand streaming for competitions and opening ceremony. Indigenous groups and academia called the absence of live TV coverage due to lack of funding as "unfortunate".
