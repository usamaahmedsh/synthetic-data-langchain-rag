The International Erasmus Games is a multi-sport event held annually for members of the Erasmus Student Network, a student organisation for students on exchange in Europe. Held annually in European cities home to Erasmus Student Network local sections and organised by volunteers, the games bring together hundreds of participants from multiple countries worldwide.
A conception of ESN Poland and ESN Italy, the first International Erasmus Games were hosted in Kraków, Poland, in 2015. Since then, the games have had seven editions hosted in seven cities in six countries. The eighth edition of the games are set to be hosted in Wrocław, Poland, from 30 May to 2 June 2024.


== History ==
The International Erasmus Games were initiated by a coordinated effort of ESN Poland and ESN Italy. The first edition of the games, hosted in Kraków, Poland, was called ESN Team. The second edition of the games were hosted in Milan, Italy. Since the second edition, the games have been called the International Erasmus Games. The regular three sports of 3x3 basketball, futsal, and volleyball were established after they were played at both of the first two editions of the games.
The third edition of games was hosted in Porto, Portugal, in 2017 and featured tennis in addition to the regular three sports. The fourth edition of the games, hosted in Niš, Serbia, also featured tennis. Paris, France, hosted the fifth edition of the games in 2019, which saw a return to the regular three sports being played. That year, the tournament welcomed 350 participants from 20 countries.
Future editions of the International Erasmus Games were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The International Erasmus Games returned following the COVID-19 pandemic with the sixth edition of the games in Coimbra, Portugal, in 2022. The sixth and seventh editions of the games, the latter of which were hosted in Madrid, Spain, featured athletics in addition to the regular three sports.
The eighth edition of the games is set to be hosted in Wrocław, Poland, from 30 May to 2 June 2024.
