The Olympic mascots are fictional characters who represent the cultural heritage of the location where the Olympic Games are taking place. They are often an animal native to the area or human figures.
One of the first Olympic mascots was created for the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble; a stylized cartoon character on skis named Schuss. The first official Olympic mascot appeared in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, and was a rainbow-colored Dachshund dog named Waldi.
Since the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, the Olympic and Paralympic mascots have always been presented together, which was first done in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The Youth Olympic Games, which are run by the International Olympic Committee, have had mascots as well.
