The 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro was televised by a number of broadcasters throughout the world. As with previous years, Olympic Broadcasting Services produced the world feed provision to local broadcasters for use in their coverage. In most regions, broadcast rights to the 2016 Summer Olympics were packaged together with those for the 2014 Winter Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well.
