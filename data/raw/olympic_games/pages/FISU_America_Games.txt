The FISU America Games (Spanish: Juegos FISU América, Portuguese: Jogos FISU América) is a continental multi-sport event between college athletes from countries of the Americas. It was first held in 2018 to provide additional competition for athletes before the global FISU World University Games, also known as the Universiade.
Its regional predecessor for South America, the South American University Games (Spanish: Juegos Universitarios Sudamericanos, Portuguese: Jogos Universitários Sul-Americanos), was first held in 2004 and originally scheduled on a quadrennial basis, but after 2010 it was held irregularly.
