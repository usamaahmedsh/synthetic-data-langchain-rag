The VI South American Games (Spanish: Juegos Sudamericanos; Portuguese: Jogos Sul-Americanos) were a multi-sport event held in 1998 in Cuenca, Azuay, Ecuador, with some events in Azogues (futsal), Gualaceo (boxing), Guayaquil (bowling, canoeing, sailing, triathlon), Paute (wrestling), and Quito (fencing). The Games were organized by the South American Sports Organization (ODESUR). An appraisal of the games and detailed medal lists were published
elsewhere,
emphasizing the results of the Argentinian teams.
The games were officially opened by Ecuadorian vice-president Gustavo Noboa. Torch lighter at the Estadio Alejandro Serrano Aguilar was Olympic gold medalist, racewalker Jefferson Pérez. In honour of the peace treaty between Ecuador and Peru soon to be signed on October 26, 1998, officially ending the recent Cenepa War, the athlete's oath was sworn jointly by Ecuadorian cyclist Francisco Encalada and Peruvian table tennis player Eliana González.
The games were initially scheduled for May 1998, but were postponed mainly because of severe flooding caused by the El Niño climate phenomenon which resulted in more than 300 deaths.  For the first time, Guyana participated at the games.  However, the Netherlands Antilles were not present, reducing the number of participating countries to 14, as in the year 1994.
