The 2010 Asian Para Games (Chinese: 2010年亚洲残疾人运动会; pinyin: Èr líng yī líng nián Yàzhōu cánjí rén yùndònghuì), also known as the First Asian Para Games, was a parallel sports event for Asian athletes with a disability held in Guangzhou, China. Two weeks after the conclusion of the 16th Asian Games, it opened on December 12 and closed on December 19, 2010.
Approximately 2,500 athletes from 45 Asian member nations participated in 341 events from 19 sports. The games was opened by vice premier Li Keqiang at the Guangdong Olympic Stadium.
The final medal tally was led by China, followed by South Korea and third-placed Japan. 17 world and 82 Asian records were broken during the games.


== Host city ==
The Asian Para Games succeeded the FESPIC Games, whose governing body, the FESPIC Federation, was dissolved during the last edition in 2006 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia after merger with Asian Paralympic Council to become Asian Paralympic Committee. 
On July 1, 2004, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) selected Guangzhou to host the 2010 Asian Games at their 23rd general assembly session in Doha, Qatar, with Guangzhou being the sole bidder of the event. A FESPIC Federation General Assembly held on 28 November 2006 at the last FESPIC Games' host city appointed the city as host of the Para Games, resulted in the tradition of hosting both the Asian Games and Para Games in the same city. 
However, as the Asian Paralympic Committee had just emerged, they had yet to sign any agreement with the Olympic Council of Asia. Hence, the Asian Para Games were not yet included in the Asian Games' host city contract. Both games ran independently of each other and were managed by different Organising Committees: Guangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee (GAGOC) for Asian Games and Guangzhou Asian Para Games Organising Committee (GAPGOC) for Asian Para Games.
