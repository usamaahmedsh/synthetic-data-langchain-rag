== History ==
In March 1902, the university trustees decided to establish a commercial course within the Department of Economics and Social Science starting the next school year, replacing the last two years of the regular university course. Upon completion of the new curriculum, a special certificate in addition to the ordinary diploma would be granted.
A separate school was established as "School of Commerce and Finance" of Indiana University in 1920 with 70 students enrolled. It was subsequently renamed "School of Business Administration" in 1933 and "School of Business" in 1938. In 1997, it was renamed "Kelley School of Business" after alumnus E.W. Kelley, chairman of the Steak 'n Shake Company, who had given a donation of $23 million. Initially, it was housed in the Commerce Building constructed in 1923 (William A. Rawles Hall since 1971), moving to the Business and Economics Building in 1940 (called Woodburn Hall since 1971), and finally to today's Business School building in 1966.
The first graduate degree offered by the school was the Master of Science in Business which was approved in 1935. In 1947, the first MBA was offered, replacing the Master of Science in Business and the Master of Commercial Science. In 1950, the first doctoral degree, the Doctor of Commercial Science, was awarded.
Although classes had been held in Indianapolis since 1961, it wasn't until the fall of 1974 that the School of Business officially expanded to Indianapolis. It resides in the Business/Spea building on the IUI campus. During the expansion, it was said that the school is "one school, one faculty, one curriculum in two locations". Thus, rankings which apply to the school's Bloomington campus, also apply to its Indianapolis campus (for the programs they both share). The dean's office is located on the Bloomington campus, but two positions, Executive Associate Dean - Indianapolis and Associate Dean of Indianapolis Research and Programs, were created to lead the Kelley School of Business curriculum, faculty and programs at IUI.
In 1980, the Wall Street Journal reported Indiana University as one of the top four undergraduate business schools in the nation.

In 2003, the Kelley School partnered with the Scotts Miracle-Gro Company to launch Bloomington Brands, a unique brand management work-study program for both undergraduates and MBA students. Participating students manage the Osmocote Plant Food brand under contract from Scotts. Bob Stohler, a former Scotts executive, instructs and oversees the students. Students manage all marketing variables for the Osmocote brand, including the selection of product formulas, sizes, packages, and pricing, as well as the development of marketing strategy, advertising, media purchase and selection, promotional activities, and consumer research. Brands students work closely with multiple business functions at Scotts.
In the summer of 2005, interim dean Dan Smith was appointed to be the new dean of the school, replacing Dean Dan Dalton who stepped down in 2004.

On March 30, 2012, the Kelley School renamed its Undergraduate Building to Hodge Hall in honor of James R. Hodge, who had given $15 million to help renovate and expand the facility. The $60 million expansion and renovation of Hodge Hall broke ground in May 2012 and opened in the fall of 2014. The Eli Lilly Foundation donated a substantial amount as well.
In June 2012, Smith stepped down as dean of the school after serving as dean for seven years to take a new position as president and CEO of the Indiana University Foundation. On May 9, 2013, interim dean Idalene Kesner was announced as the new dean of the school. Kesner is the first woman to serve as dean
In February 2025, it was announced that Kelley accounting department faculty member, accounting professor, and current vice dean Patrick E. Hopkins would be taking over from Ash Soni as the dean of the Kelley School of Business, effective March 17, 2025.
