The 1990 Asian Games, also known as the XI Asiad and the 11th Asian Games (第十一届亚洲运动会) or simply Beijing 1990 (北京1990), were held from September 22 to October 7, 1990, in Beijing, China. This was the first Asian Games held in China.
Along with the 1993 East Asian Games, this event served as a precursor to China's further development in the sporting arena, as before the city went on to bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics (losing to Sydney) and eventually won the bids for the 2001 Summer Universiade, the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics . In a fact with precedent, China dominated the games, grabbing 60% of the gold medals and 34% of the total medal count. China set a new record by becoming the first nation in the history of the Asian Games to cross the 100-gold medal mark and the 300-total medal mark in one edition.
This also marked Taiwan's first participation in the Asian Games as Chinese Taipei.


== Bidding process ==
In 1983, Beijing and Hiroshima demonstrated interest in hosting the 1990 Asian Games. The two cities made formal presentations before the Olympic Council of Asia board. They were evaluated in a meeting of the council in Seoul during 1984, which also served to evaluate the preparations for the next Asian Games and also for the 1988 Summer Olympics.
Beijing eventually won the right to host the 1990 edition, while the team from Hiroshima presented an excellent technical bid, and won the rights to host of the 1994 Asian Games as compensation in an unprecedented move.
34 votes were needed for selection.
