Poltroon was an event horse ridden by American rider Torrance Watkins. Poltroon and Torrance competed at the 1980 Alternate Olympics in Fontainebleau, France winning a bronze Medal. This was particularly notable due Poltroon's diminutive size for an event horse and that this was the first time a woman had won an Olympic Medal for eventing. Poltroon was a 15.1h Paint mare who went on to become a broodmare in her retirement.
