The 2022 European Championships were the second edition of the European Championships. It was a multi-sport event which took place in Munich, Germany from 11 to 21 August 2022. The event started three days after the closing ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games held in Birmingham, Great Britain.
Athletics, cycling, triathlon, women's artistic gymnastics, men's artistic gymnastics and rowing returned after appearing in the inaugural Championships in 2018. New to this edition of the Championships were beach volleyball, canoe sprint, and, for the first time, a full slate of para-sport events, sport climbing and table tennis.
Unlike the 2018 European Championships, swimming, diving, artistic swimming and open water swimming were not part of the program of the event, as the European Aquatics Championships were held at the same time but in Rome, Italy. Golf, in the form of the European Golf Team Championships, did not return for this edition.
