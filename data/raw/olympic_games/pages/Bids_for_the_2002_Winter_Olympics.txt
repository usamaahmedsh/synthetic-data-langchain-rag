A record 10 cities submitted bids to host the 2002 Winter Olympics (formally known as the XIX Olympic Winter Games). Due to the exceptionally large number of candidates, a procedure was created for the first time by the IOC for choosing a shortlist. The Games were awarded to Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, on June 16, 1995, during the 104th IOC Session in Budapest. The other cities shortlisted by the IOC Selection Committee chaired by Thomas Bach were Sion, Switzerland; Östersund, Sweden; and Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.
The host city selection procedure for the 2002 Winter Olympics faced a scandal regarding the interactions between the Salt Lake City bid team and International Olympic Committee (IOC) members; ten IOC members resigned as a result, as did Salt Lake City bid leaders Tom Welch and Dave Johnson.  Nevertheless, Salt Lake City overwhelmingly won the right to host the Games, needing only one round to gain the absolute majority of the votes.
From both sporting and business standpoints, this was one of the most successful Winter Olympic Games in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs. Over 2 billion viewers watched more than 13 billion viewer-hours. The Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, which left SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. The surplus was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation, which maintains and operates many of the remaining Olympic venues.
