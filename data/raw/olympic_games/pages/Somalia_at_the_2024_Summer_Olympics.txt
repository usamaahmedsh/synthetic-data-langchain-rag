Somalia competed at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris from 26 July to 11 August 2024. Since the nation's debut in 1972, Somalia competed in every Summer Olympics except for three occasions: 1976, due to Congolese-led boycott, 1980, due to US led boycott, and 1992, due to political reasons. It will be the nation's eleventh appearance at the Summer Olympics.
Somalia's team consisted of one male track and field athlete. Ali Idow Hassan as Somalia's only athlete, served as the country's opening ceremony flagbearer. Ultimately, Ali Idow Hassan was eliminated for not starting in the repechage, failing to earn his Olympic medal as a result.
