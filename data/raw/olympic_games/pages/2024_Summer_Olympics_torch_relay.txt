The 2024 Summer Olympic torch relay ran from 16 April 2024 until 26 July 2024. After it was lit in Olympia, Greece, the torch then travelled through Greece, arriving at Athens on 26 April. It sailed across the Mediterranean on the three-masted barque Belem to Marseille on 9 May and subsequently began its travel across Metropolitan and Overseas France, as well as Monaco. The French leg ended during the opening ceremony when it was used to light the Olympic cauldron. The cauldron was erected at the Tuileries Garden's central fountain.

Each day, the relay covered a different part of France. Several French cities and towns received the flame, as well as one or two iconic places, such as historical places or natural landmarks. One or two team relays also took place: 24 participants, led by a captain and representing an Olympic or Paralympic French sports federation, carried the flame together for a leg. Each daily relay ended in a stage town, where a mini-cauldron was lit and celebrations took place. This list also included a stopover in Monaco, as well as the June 11 leg scheduled for Nouméa, New Caledonia which was cancelled due to the 2024 New Caledonia unrest.
