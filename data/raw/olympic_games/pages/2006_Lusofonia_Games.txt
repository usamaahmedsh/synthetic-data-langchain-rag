The 2006 Lusofonia Games (Portuguese: 1.os Jogos da Lusofonia; Chinese: 第一屆葡語系運動會) were held in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China between 7 and 15 October 2006. The 2006 Games were the first edition of this multi-sport event for Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, under the banner of ACOLOP.
The site for the opening ceremony was the Macau Stadium and the closing ceremony was held at the Macau East Asian Games Dome. The mascot for the games was a dog named Leo. The pronunciation of "Leo" in Portuguese is similar to Chinese (嚟澳; Lei O) and it means "Come to Macau".
Due to the high expenses, some of the participating NOCs received financial support from the International Olympic Committee and Olympic Committee of Portugal.
