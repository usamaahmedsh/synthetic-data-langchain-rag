== Reception ==

Torino 2006 received "generally unfavorable reviews" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
Detroit Free Press gave the Xbox version a score of two stars out of four and said, "Button-mashing is almost nonexistent. That's a big change from Athens 2004, the last Olympics game I played, which required you to hit buttons frantically to make your athlete move." The Times gave the game two stars out of five and said, "The result in single-player mode is a messy, unresponsive mass of button-pushing and frantic joystick-twiddling that evolves from impossible to challenging to repetitive and dull in less than an hour." The Sydney Morning Herald gave it one-and-a-half stars out of five and said that the game "makes it about as exciting as lying in an empty bath and pretending it's the luge, or sticking your head in the freezer and singing Advance Australia Fair." The A.V. Club gave it an F and called it "a game more excruciating than an evening of ice-dancing preliminaries."
