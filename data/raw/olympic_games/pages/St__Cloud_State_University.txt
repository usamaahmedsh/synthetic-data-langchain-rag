St. Cloud State University (SCSU) is a public university in St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States. Founded in 1869, the university is one of the largest institutions in the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. In the fall of 2023, it enrolled 8,430 undergraduate and 2,084 graduate students.


== History ==

St. Cloud State was founded in 1869 as the Third State Normal School. At the time, the school consisted of just one building, the Stearns House, a former renovated hotel purchased by the state Legislature for $3,000. The faculty included five members, led by Principal Ira Moore. Of the first 50 students, 40 were women. As more women enrolled and the Old Main building opened in early 1874, the Stearns House was fully converted into a women’s dormitory later that year. Male students later formed a boarding club and found a house near campus, which was supervised by a matron.
In 1898, the school offered a junior college curriculum. In 1914, the school dropped its secondary education program. The Legislature authorized a name change in 1921 to St. Cloud State Teachers College. In 1957, the word "Teachers" was dropped. The first bachelor's degrees were awarded in 1925. In 1975, St. Cloud State became a university comprising five colleges and a graduate school. Applied doctoral degrees were first offered in 2007.
Enrollment at St. Cloud State dropped from roughly 18,000 in 2010 to roughly 10,000 in 2024. Of these, only about 5,000 were traditional full-time students, the rest being part-time students, including about 2,500 students under 18 enrolled in PSEO courses. This steep decline led to financial problems including a net loss of $18 million in 2023 and a budget deficit of $14.4 million in 2024. This led the university to make severe budget cuts, including cutting 42 degree programs, 50 minors, 54 full-time faculty, 42 staff, four administrative positions, eliminating football, and heavily scaling back student events like homecoming. About 52% of the College of Education and Learning Design and 42% of the College of Liberal Arts programs were eliminated as part of this effort. To help slow the enrollment decline and increase revenue, the university signed a contract with Academic Partnerships to increase its online course offerings for nontraditional students. It also plans to remove numerous unused buildings and structures to decrease management costs.
