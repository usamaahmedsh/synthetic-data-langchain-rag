The 2025 Islamic Solidarity Games (Arabic: ألعاب التضامن الإسلامي 2025), officially the 6th Islamic Solidarity Games (Arabic: دورة ألعاب التضامن الإسلامي السادسة) and also known as Riyadh 2025 (Arabic: الرياض 2025), was a inter-continental multi-sport event organised by the Islamic Solidarity Sports Association (ISSA), which holds from 7 to 21 November 2025 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
The event returns to its regular four-year cycle, following the 2021 Islamic Solidarity Games in Konya, Turkey, which were postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


== Host selection ==
On 15 April 2021, Cameroon's bid was selected to host the Games, which were initially set to become the first edition held on the African continent. However, due to concerns over the country's infrastructure and readiness, the Islamic Solidarity Sports Association (ISSA) later withdrew the hosting rights and awarded the event to Saudi Arabia, with Riyadh confirmed as the new host city.

=== Mascot ===
The official mascot of the Games, Finjaal (Arabic: فنجال) was unveiled on 1 August 2025. He embodies the values of generosity and authenticity, which are considered among the most cherished virtues in Arab culture and have been passed down through generations.
Finjaal derives its name from the traditional Arab coffee cup, or finjan, a symbol of generosity and authenticity in Arab culture. Its head is shaped like a finjan, cream-colored with a golden rim and decorated with green palm fronds and small red accents reminiscent of dates or pomegranates. It is described as brave, skilled, adventurous, artistic, and energetic.


=== Slogan ===
The official slogan of the 2025 Islamic Solidarity Games, “One Nation”, was announced 30 days before the start of the tournament. The slogan is intended to symbolize the unity, solidarity, and shared values among the countries of the Islamic world through the power of sport.
