As a multi-sport event, competitions held during a given Olympic Games usually take place in different venues located across the host city and its metropolitan area. However, some Olympic competitions may be held outside the host metropolitan area, and instead in other regions of the host country (as it is usually the case with Football at the Summer Olympics and its requirements for large stadia).
One venue is designated as the "Olympic Stadium", the big centrepiece stadium of the games. Traditionally at the Summer Olympic Games, the opening and closing ceremonies and the Athletics competitions are held in the Olympic Stadium. The Winter Olympic Games do not usually have a central Olympic Stadium, but instead have edifices that are designated as the Olympic Stadium to host the opening and closing ceremonies.
