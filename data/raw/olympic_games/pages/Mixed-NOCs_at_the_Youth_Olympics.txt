Mixed-NOCs (IOC code: MIX) are Youth Olympic Games teams consisting of athletes representing different National Olympic Committees (NOCs). The concept of mixed-NOCs was introduced at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, in which athletes from different nations would compete in the same team. It was also used in multiple sports at the Winter Youth Olympics since 2012.
