The 2025 FISU Winter World University Games, also known as Turin 2025 or Torino 2025, was a multi-sport event for student and youth athletes, held between 13–23 January 2025, in Turin, Italy. The Piedmontese capital was confirmed as the host city for the games on 15 May 2021. This was the 12th time that the World University Games had been held in Italy, the 7th time that the Winter Games were held in Italy, and the 2nd time in the city, as the city previously hosted the 2007 Games. The city is considered the birthplace of the event, as it hosted the first summer Games in 1959 and again in 1970, becoming the first city to host summer and winter editions of the World University Games. If the summer editions are counted, this was the 12th time that the World University Games have been held on Italian soil, as the most recent were the 2019 Games held in Naples.
The 2025 FISU Winter World University Games were the first World University Games event to feature para-athletes competing in para-sport events, alongside the existing able-bodied events, as part of FISU’s long-term strategy of inclusiveness and social sustainability.


== Bidding process ==
On 6 July 2020, representatives from the Metropolitan City of Turin, Piedmont Region, University of Turin, Polytechnic of Turin, CUS Turin, EDISU and University of Eastern Piedmont formally announced their candidature to host the 2025 Winter games. The joint bid, known as "Torino 2025," included for the second time intentions to host parasports events, in tandem with the 2025 World Winter Special Olympics in Piedmont Region. The Italian government's Minister of Sport, Vincenzo Spadafora, confirmed his strong support for the candidature on 7 July 2020. Considered the birthplace of the event, the city has hosted the 1959 and 1970 Summer Universiades, the 2006 Winter Olympics and Paralympics and the 2007 Winter Universiade and has a tradition of hosting international sporting and entreteniment events and also hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in 2022. Italy's relationship with university sports also stands out, as Rome hosted the Summer Games in 1975, while Sicily in also hosted the same event 1997 and Naples in more recently in 2019, replacing Brasília as host city. Sestriere was the first Winter Games edition in the same event in 1966 games, with Turin serving as the host city for ice hockey. And just as in 2007, it will be the sub-venue for snow events. Livigno in Sondrio Province, the 1975 Winter Games. In 1985, it was the turn of the resort of Belluno in Veneto. Another resort, Tarvisio in the most northeastern part of the country with neighboring cities in Austria and Slovenia, co-hosted the 2003 winter event. And in 2013 when the province of Trentino replaced Maribor in Slovenia and hosted the event during the bid process for the 2026 Winter Olympics with some venues who were also part of the project.
Despite having begun, negotiations for this edition to be held in Lucerne, Switzerland due to the cancellation of the 2021 Winter Universiade due to the COVID-19 pandemic did not come to fruition, and in addition, there was a joint proposal made by Sweden and Finland, led by Stockholm as main host.
