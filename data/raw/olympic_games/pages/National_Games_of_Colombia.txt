The National Games of Colombia (Spanish: Juegos Deportivos Nacionales) is the premier multi-sport event of Colombia at national level.  The first instance of the event was organized in 1928 and for several years it took place at irregular intervals of time. Currently overseen by the Ministry of Sports, the National Games were initially organised by each department and municipality until 1941. After that, they were directly funded by the government and later managed by Coldeportes from 1968 to 2019. The event has been held regularly every 4 years since 1988, except for 2014.
Valle del Cauca has been the most successful department in the history of the national games (9 times), followed by Antioquia (8 times) and next Bogotá (one time).
