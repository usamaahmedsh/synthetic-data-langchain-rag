NCAA Season 86 was the 2010–11 season of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) of the Philippines. The host for this year was San Sebastian College–Recoletos (SSC–R).
The official theme and slogan of the season was Youth Speaks @ 86!


== Probationary member schools ==
After being guest schools in the 2009-10 season, Arellano University and Emilio Aguinaldo College were accepted as probationary members for this season. Angeles University Foundation backed out on being a probationary member.


== Basketball ==

The centerpiece event, the seniors' basketball tournament will begin on June 26 at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. Instead of the traditional opening day where all teams will play, only four teams will do, although the tradition of the champion team playing the host school in the second game will still be done, with host school and defending champions San Sebastian Stags going up against last season's hosts and dethroned champions San Beda Red Lions. The first Sunday games in league history were played the next day at the Filoil Flying V Arena in San Juan. This was made in deference to June 30, the day of the inauguration of President Benigno Aquino III. After that, games will be played on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, with the juniors games tipping off at 10:00 a.m. and the seniors at 2:00 p.m.
