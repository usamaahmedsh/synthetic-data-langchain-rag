The National Olympic Committee of Thailand under the Royal Patronage of His Majesty the King (Thai: คณะกรรมการโอลิมปิคแห่งประเทศไทย ในพระบรมราชูปถัมภ์) is the national Olympic committee in Thailand for the Olympic Games movement, based in Ampawan House, Bangkok, Thailand. It is a nonprofit organisation that selects teams and raises funds to send Thailand competitors to Olympic events organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Asian Games events organised by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and Southeast Asian Games events organised by the Southeast Asian Games Federation (SEAGF).


== History ==
The forerunner of the NOCT was the "International Relations Committee for Sports" which was set up in 1946, originally a society for expatriates living in Thailand to participate in sports, and raise money through ticket sales for public sports participation and the Thai Red Cross Society.
The committee decided to create an official Olympic organization to help develop good relations with other nations via sport, and the NOCT was officially formed on 20 June 1948, and subsequently recognized by the International Olympic Committee at the IOC meeting in Copenhagen on 15 May 1950. His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) granted a Royal Patronage to the NOCT on 26 December 1949, as well as the official Symbol of the Olympic Committee of Thailand on 8 January 1951.
