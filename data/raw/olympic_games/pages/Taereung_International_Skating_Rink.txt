Taereung International Skating Rink is a speed skating oval in South Korea, used for training and competitions, operated by the Korean Olympic Committee. It is one of only two indoor long-track (400m) skating facilities in the country, and the most actively used, with Gangneung Oval completed in 2017 for the 2018 Winter Olympics but planned for conversion to a multi-sports and convention center. It is also one of the remaining active training grounds of the Korea National Training Center in Gongneung-dong, Nowon-gu in northeast Seoul; most other teams, including the short track and ice hockey teams, have moved to Jincheon National Training Center
