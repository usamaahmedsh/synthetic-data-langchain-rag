The World Transplant Games Federation (abbreviated as WTGF) is a United Kingdom-based non-profit organisation that aims to promote amateur sport amongst organ transplant recipients, living donors and donor families. The WTGF promotes the study of transplantation and aims to educate the public and raise awareness of the world shortage of donor organs. It shares new knowledge from biological/clinical studies and promotes the mental and moral improvement for recipients, living donors and donor families; and fosters international friendship and relations.
Established in 1978, the WTGF was formally incorporated in 2017 and is responsible for the organisation of World Transplant Games events, including the Summer Transplant Games and the Winter Transplant Games, both held every two years, on alternate years.
The WTGF is affiliated with the International Olympic Committee (2013 and 2021) and its headquarters are located in Winchester.
