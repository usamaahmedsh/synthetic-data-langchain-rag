In the United States, the Games will be broadcast by NBCUniversal properties, as part of a long-term contract with the IOC through 2032. Hollywood Park Studios at SoFi Stadium is the planned site of the International Broadcast Centre for the Games along with the NBC/Universal Studios Lot.
On January 16, 2023, the IOC renewed its European pay television and streaming rights agreements with Warner Bros. Discovery through 2032, covering 49 European territories. Unlike the previous contract where corporate precursor Discovery, Inc. was responsible for sublicensing them to broadcasters in each country, free-to-air rights packages were concurrently awarded to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and its members, where each broadcaster would carry at least 200 hours of coverage of the 2028 Summer Olympics.
