The Pakistan Olympic Association was created in 1948, while the Pakistan Sports Board was established in 1962.
Pakistan first participated in the Olympic Games in 1948 in London, and has sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union. It has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, when alpine skier Mohammad Abbas became the first Pakistani athlete to qualify for a Winter Olympics event.
Pakistani athletes have won a total of 11 medals, all in the Summer Olympics, including 4 gold medals. Pakistan's men's field hockey team won eight medals in the nine games it participated in between 1956 and 1992. This included a run of 5 consecutive finals between 1956 and 1972, where the Hockey team won 2 gold and 3 silver medals in quick succession. 
Arshad Nadeem is the only Pakistani athlete to have won an individual Olympic gold medal and set an Olympic record.


== History ==


=== Before independence (pre–1947) ===
In the Olympic Games up until 1936, athletes from modern-day Pakistan participated as part of the team from British India. Several gold medalists for India in field hockey were born in what became Pakistan, including Muhammad Aslam (1932), Lal Shah Bokhari (1932), Sayed Jaffar (1932 and 1936), Ali Dara (1936) and Peter Paul Fernandes (1936). Bokhari was also selected as India's flagbearer in the 1932 opening ceremony. All of these men opted to play for Pakistan post independence in 1947. Others made the switch after the 1948 Olympics, such as Latif-ur Rehman and Akhtar Hussain.


=== Early years (1948 – 1952) ===
Pakistan first participated in the 1948 Summer Olympics and sent a contingent of 39 athletes that took part across seven different sports. The stand out performers were the men's hockey team who topped their group by beating Belgium, Denmark, France and Netherlands but lost their semi-final match to Great Britain 0–2. Pakistan then faced the Netherlands during the bronze medal match. Initially Pakistan drew with the Netherlands 1–1, but during  the replay lost 1–4 and had to settle for a 4th placed finish.
During the 1952 Summer Olympics, there was much of the same result, with the hockey team reaching the semis where they lost to Netherlands 0–1 and then went on to lose the bronze medal match to Great Britain 1–2. Yet again finishing at the 4th place. Other highlights during the games included the Men's 4 x 100 metres relay team which also reached the semi-finals.


=== Men's Hockey Team's Golden Era (1956 – 1984) ===


==== Melbourne 1956: Hockey team wins Silver medal ====
Pakistan men's hockey team's 'Golden Era' began during 1956, when they cruised through to the finals by beating Great Britain 3–2 in the semi-final, to set up a clash with arch-rivals India. Pakistan lost the final to India 0–1, but in doing so, secured their first ever Olympic medal, a silver medal. Elsewhere Abdul Khaliq reached the semi-finals of both the Men's 100 metres and Men's 200 metres. As did Ghulam Raziq who reached the semi-final of the Men's 110 metres hurdles and Pakistan also reached the semi-finals of the Men's 4 x 100 metres relay.


==== Rome 1960: Hockey team wins Gold, Muhammad Bashir wins Bronze ====

During the 1960 Summer Olympics, the hockey team topped their group by comprehensively beating Australia 3–0, Poland 8–0 and Japan 10–0. They then beat Germany 2–1 in the quarter-finals and Spain 1–0 in the semi-final to set up another showdown with India. This time Pakistan came out as the successors and beat India 1–0 in the final to clinch their first ever Olympic gold medal and in the process halted India's run of 6 consecutive gold medals.
In the Men's freestyle welterweight wrestling, Muhammad Bashir made history by reaching the last round and finished 3rd out of 23 wrestlers, to win Pakistan its first ever individual medal and first ever non-Hockey Olympic medal.


==== Tokyo 1964: Hockey team wins a Silver medal ====
At the 1964 Summer Olympics the Hockey team continued their good form from the previous Olympics and marched into the semi-finals where they decisively beat Spain 3–0. However, the Hockey team then came undone against India in the final and couldn't replicate the success of four years ago, so they had to settle for a silver medal after losing to India 0–1.


==== Mexico City 1968: Hockey team wins Gold yet again ====
During the 1968 Summer Olympics, Pakistan chose to reduce their contingent to only 20 players and focussed only on the sports of Men's Field Hockey and Men's wrestling, as those were the sports where Pakistan had previously achieved success. The Hockey team remained undefeated throughout the group stage to reach the semi-final where they beat Germany 1–0 after extra time, before beating Australia 2–1 in the final to win the gold medal for a second time.


==== Munich 1972: Hockey team settles for a Silver medal ====
At the 1972 Summer Olympics, Pakistan's hockey team played fairly well to reach the semis where they beat India 2–0 before facing West Germany in the finals. The final was marked with controversy with Pakistan being unhappy with the umpiring throughout the match. Pakistan protested against a goal being disallowed, along with a controversial decision to award West Germany a penalty corner through which they scored the only goal of the match and went on to win the gold medal. All eleven Pakistani players who played in the final were later suspended for disorderly and unsporting behaviour during the medal ceremony. The Pakistan Hockey Federation was suspended for 4 years, while the manager of the hockey team and the players involved in the incidents after the final were handed life-time bans. The bans and suspensions were only revoked in 1974, when the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, personally apologised for the incidents.


==== Montreal 1976: Hockey team has to settle for a Bronze medal, introduction of AstroTurfs ====
For the first time since 1952, Pakistan's hockey team failed to reach the Olympic final at the 1976 Summer Olympics. The team topped their group but lost to Australia 1–2 in the semi-final and only won the bronze medal after defeating the Netherlands 3–2 in the bronze medal match. This was also the first time that field Hockey matches during the Olympics were played on AstroTurf surfaces.


==== Los Angeles 1984: Hockey team is back to winnings ways, wins a Gold medal ====
After boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow as a protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan returned to the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and picked up from where they had left off. The hockey team ranked 2nd in their group behind Great Britain and made it to the semi-finals where they beat Australia 1–0, before beating West Germany 2–1, to clinch their 3rd Olympic title.


=== 3rd place finishes for Hussain Shah and Men's Hockey team (1988 – 1992) ===


==== Seoul 1988: Hussain Shah wins Bronze in Boxing ====
The hockey team had its worst performance yet at the 1988 Summer Olympics as they failed to qualify for the semi-finals and finished fifth after beating India 2–1. However, Hussain Shah saved the country from embarrassment.
Hussain Shah received a bye in the round of 64, before cruising through the rounds to reach the semi-final, guaranteeing himself a bronze medal. He lost the semi-final to Egerton Marcus, but ended up as joint 3rd place to win Pakistan its first ever individual medal in boxing and only the second ever individual medal after the bronze medal won by Muhammad Bashir in 1960.


==== Barcelona 1992: Hockey team wins Bronze medal ====
After the debacle in Seoul 1988, the hockey team went about business as usual and topped their group by remaining unbeaten in the 1992 Summer Olympics. They did lose the semi-final to Germany 1–2, but came from behind in the bronze medal match to beat the Netherlands 4–3 and won the bronze medal.


=== Decline (1996 – 2016) ===

The decline in Olympics for Pakistan coincides with the decline in the fortunes of their hockey team. The hockey team failed to win an Olympic medal during this time period. With the only highlight being when the hockey team reached the semi-finals during the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but lost to South Korea 0–1 and then lost the bronze medal match to Australia 3–6. It all culminated with 2016 being the worst ever games for Pakistan, as the Hockey team failed to qualify, and none of Pakistan's athletes managed to make it out of their preliminary rounds.


=== Resurgence (2020 – Present day) ===


==== Tokyo 2020: Arshad Nadeem reaches Javelin throw Final ====
10 athletes represented Pakistan at the 2020 Summer Olympics. Resurgence from Pakistan began on the back of performances from Arshad Nadeem and Talha Talib. Arshad Nadeem made history by becoming the first Pakistani athlete to qualify for the Olympics directly and then qualifying for the final with a throw of 85.16m where he topped his group and was 3rd amongst the qualifiers. But he failed to replicate that performance in the final and mentioned the nerves of the occasion getting to him. He ended up on 5th place with a throw of 84.62m in the Final. Talha Talib during his Men's 67kg weightlifting event, lifted 150kg during the snatch round, which placed him in 2nd place. But lifted 170kg during the clean and jerk round, which placed him 7th in the round, and 5th overall. He missed out on a bronze medal by just 2kgs.


==== Paris 2024: Arshad Nadeem wins Gold medal, creates Olympic record ====

Pakistan sent a contingent of 7 athletes to participate at the 2024 Summer Olympics. Arshad Nadeem made history for Pakistan by becoming the first ever Pakistani to win an individual Olympic gold medal with an Olympic record throw of 92.97m. Arshad also threw another 90m+ throw, with his last throw being 91.79m, which was also longer than the Olympic record of 90.57m set in Beijing 2008. Arshad's gold medal was the first gold medal won by Pakistan since 1984, the first Olympic medal won since 1992, and his throw of 92.97m was also the 6th longest throw in history, when considering only the best throw from each athlete.
