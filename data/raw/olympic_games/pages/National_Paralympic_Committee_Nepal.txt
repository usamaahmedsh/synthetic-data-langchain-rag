National Paralympic Committee Nepal  (Nepali: राष्ट्रिय पाराओलम्पिक कमिटि नेपाल; NPC code: NEP) is responsible for selecting athletes to represent Nepal at the Paralympic Games, Asian Para Games and other international para sports competitions, and managing Nepalese teams at these events. NPC Nepal is dedicated to promoting sports for individuals with disabilities. The main focus of the committee is to organize, supervise, and coordinate sports events and competitions for them.
Since the establishment of the National Sports Council (Nepal) in 1959, Nepalese athletes made their Olympic Games debut at the 1964 Summer Olympics and their Paralympic Games debut at the 2004 Summer Paralympics. However, Nepal had not secured an official medal in either event—until taekwondo athlete Palesha Goverdhan made history by winning a bronze medal at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games. This marked Nepal’s first-ever official medal in the Paralympic Games or Olympic Games, placing the country on the Paralympic medal tally for the very first time. For this historic and remarkable achievement, Palesha Goverdhan was awarded रू65 lakh (US$48,000) by the Nepalese prime minister KP Oli on behalf of the Government of Nepal on 13 September 2024.
