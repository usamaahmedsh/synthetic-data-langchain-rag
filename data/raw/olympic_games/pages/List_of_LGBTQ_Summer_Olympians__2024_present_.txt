There are 86 modern Summer Olympic athletes, who made their Olympic debut in 2024 and have identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, pansexual, non-binary, queer, or have openly been in a same-sex relationship.
According to Outsports, there were at least 199 out athletes (including those who debuted earlier) at the 2024 Summer Olympics, which they reported as the most athletes competing in one edition of the Games who were widely out beforehand; Outsports also noted the record number of out male athletes, though most of the LGBTQ+ Olympians were female as in previous editions. In two women's team sport rosters, for United States women's basketball and Australia women's football, over half of the players were identified as LGBTQ (in the Australia football squad, it was two-thirds). German footballer Lena Oberdorf and Colombian skateboarder Jazmín Álvarez were both included in their respective Olympic teams, but both suffered ACL and MCL injuries shortly before being able to take part.
At least 27 LGBT+ Summer Olympians who debuted in 2024 are medalists (31.40%), of which 8 have at least one gold medal (9.30%).
