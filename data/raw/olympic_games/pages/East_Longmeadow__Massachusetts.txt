== History ==
The town of Longmeadow, Massachusetts was first settled in the 17th century. In the 1750s houses started appearing in the eastern part of the town known as "East Village". In 1894, East Village separated from Longmeadow, and became officially incorporated as East Longmeadow in the same year. The town became well known for its brownstone quarries, even when it was still a part of Longmeadow.
A railroad was built through the town in the late 19th century by Springfield and New London Railroad. The railroad wasn't a part of a major route so it became abandoned by the 1980s. In the early 2010s, a bike path called The Redstone Rail Trail was built on a 1.6 mile section of where the tracks ran. It runs from Maple Street to Denslow Road. In 2020, the old train depot was bought and renovated into an ice cream stand. It opened in spring 2021.
