The Indonesian Olympic Committee (Indonesian: Komite Olimpiade Indonesia, KOI) (IOC Code: INA) is the national Olympic committee of Indonesia and the member of Olympic Council of Asia. Their duty is to organize Indonesian participation in international sporting events, such as Summer Olympic Games, Asian Games, and Southeast Asian Games. They are also responsible for submitting bid for Indonesia as the host, planning and organizing official international sporting events to be held in Indonesia.


== History ==
The Indonesian Olympic Committee was founded on January 19, 1947, with Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX as the first president. KOI immediately contacted the IOC, asking to be an IOC member. In February 10, KOI sent a letter declaring its intention to send Indonesian athletes to the 1948 Olympics in London. However, domestic security situation pertaining to the Second Dutch military aggression prevented KOI to send athletes to the event.
KOI finally became a member of International Olympic Committee (IOC) on 11 March 1952.
