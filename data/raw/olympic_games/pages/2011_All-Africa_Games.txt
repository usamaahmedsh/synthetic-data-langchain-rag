== Venues and infrastructure ==
When Mozambique initially announced its ability to host the 10th Games, there was a possibility of a paring down of the sports to be offered, due to time constraints and a potential lack of facilities for the Games (e.g. the country has no field hockey field capable of hosting a Games-level competition). However, the Games eventually featured 20 sports, down 4 from the 24 hosted at the 2007 All-Africa Games.
