The 1989 Summer Universiade, also known as the XV Summer Universiade, took place in Duisburg, West Germany. It was a scaled-down event with only four sports after the original hosts, Brazil, were forced to pull out due to a mounting financial crisis in that country. A total of 1785 athletes from 79 nations participated in the event organized by the International University Sports Federation.
