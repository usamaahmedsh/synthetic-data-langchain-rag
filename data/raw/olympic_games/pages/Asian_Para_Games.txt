The Asian Para Games, also known as Para Asiad, is a multi-sport event regulated by the Asian Paralympic Committee that's held every four years after every Asian Games for athletes with physical disabilities. Both events had adopted the strategy used by the Olympic and Paralympic Games of having both games in the same city. However, the exclusion of Asian Para Games from Asian Games host city contract meant that both events ran independently of each other. The Games are recognized by the International Paralympic Committee and are described as the second largest multi-sport event after the Paralympic Games.
In its history, three nations have hosted the Asian Para Games and forty-four nations have participated in the Games.
The most recent games was held in Hangzhou, China between 22 and 28 October 2023. The next games are scheduled to be held in Nagoya, Japan from 18 to 24 October 2026.


== History ==
The FESPIC Games existed previous to the Asian Para Games and was contested by athletes from the Asia Pacific region. The FESPIC Games was first held in 1975 in Oita, Japan with 18 participating nations. Eight more FESPIC Games were held until 2006.
The Asian Para Games superseded the FESPIC Games, which was dissolved alongside the FESPIC Federation, the governing body of the games and merged with the Asian Paralympic Council which was renamed as the Asian Paralympic Committee at the closing of the final FESPIC edition held in November 2006 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The first Asian multi-sports event for athletes with a disability, the inaugural Asian Para Games was held in 2010 in Guangzhou, China.
Although there is the idea of holding the Asian and the Asian Para Games in the same city as happening on the Olympics and the Paralympics, to this day there is no mention of the Para Asian Games in the contract for the host city of the Asian Games, which means that the events could be held completely separately and without any connection. Both events ran independently of each other and could be organized by different Organising Committees in different cities.
