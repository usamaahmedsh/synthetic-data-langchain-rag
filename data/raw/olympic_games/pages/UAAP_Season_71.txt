== Universal rules ==
Two-round eliminations, the top 4 teams enter the semifinals, with the top 2 seeds possessing the twice-to-beat advantage. Semifinal winners play in the best-of-three finals.
If there are ties in the standings, the standard tiebreaking procedure will be used per sport, except for the last seed, in which an extra game will be held to break the tie.
Exception: In basketball and volleyball, an extra game will be played regardless of the position and tiebreaking procedure recommended in a sport.
If a team wins all of their elimination round games, the postseason will be scrapped and that team will win the championship outright.
Exceptions:
In basketball, the team that wins all elimination round games will have the thrice-to-beat advantage in the finals.
In volleyball, the team that wins all elimination round games advances outright to the finals.
In both instances, the #3 and #4 teams play for a berth to face the #2 seed with the twice-to-win advantage in the semifinals.
