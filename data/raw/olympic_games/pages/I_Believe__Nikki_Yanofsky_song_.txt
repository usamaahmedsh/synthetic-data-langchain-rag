"I Believe" is a song sung by Canadian jazz-pop singer Nikki Yanofsky. Written by Stephan Moccio and Alan Frew for Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium, it was used as the official promotional song for both the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. It is also the official theme song for the former. Themes from this song appeared in the main title sequence music, and were used to create cues for use during actual Olympic coverage broadcasts. A French version of the song, "J'imagine" was recorded and sung by Annie Villeneuve.
