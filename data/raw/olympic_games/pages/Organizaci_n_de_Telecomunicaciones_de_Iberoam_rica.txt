The Organización de Telecomunicaciones de Iberoamérica in Spanish and Organização das Telecomunicações Ibero-americanas in Portuguese (acronym OTI), formerly known as Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana / Organização da Televisão Ibero-americana (transl. Organization of Iberoamerican Television), is an organization of Spanish and Portuguese-language television networks in Ibero-America –comprising Latin America, Portugal, and Spain; as well as Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Netherlands Antilles, and the United States–. Its mission is to foster relations between television networks in the region to share their knowledge and experience. Among other activities, it shares news, cultural, educational, and sports programming among its members.
Between 1972 and 2000, OTI organized the Festival OTI de la Canción, an international song competition between its member broadcasters that was transmitted live via satellite to all of them, and which gave many famous artists and hit songs in the countries in which it was broadcast.
Between 1977 and 1983, Televisión Española (TVE) with the support of OTI, produced the weekly magazine 300 millones. This variety show, with musical performances, cultural and news reports, interviews, and contests, was broadcast in Spain and transmitted to the Spanish-language OTI member broadcasters via satellite.
OTI also secured the television broadcasting rights for its members in their countries of major international events such as the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cups, Copa América, etc.
