The 9th Micronesian Games were held from July 15 to July 27, 2018, in Yap, Federated States of Micronesia. The venues included the Matson Sports Complex in Abay, and several locations around Colonia.


== Participating nations ==
Ordinarily, there are 10 participants at the games. However, Nauru was unable to fully compete in this edition due to travel costs. Of the fifty-five that were to be the Nauruan team to the Games, only one Nauruan athlete participated; in the end, Jonah Harris won a total of 5 medals, 2 of which were gold. 
As such, the participants at the games were: the four constituent states of the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, Yap), three sovereign countries (Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Palau) and two insular areas of the United States (Northern Mariana Islands, Guam) all located within the Micronesia region.


== Sports ==
Athletes competed in 13 different sports at the games: athletics, baseball, basketball, beach volleyball, the "Micronesian all-around", open water swimming, soccer, spearfishing, 
va'a, table tennis, volleyball, weightlifting, and wrestling.
Previously at the 2014 games 14 sports were contested. However, this edition of the games saw the removal of softball and tennis and the inclusion of beach volleyball.
