Each Paralympic Games have a mascot, often an animal native to the area or occasionally human figures representing the cultural heritage. Nowadays, most of the merchandise aimed at young people focuses on the mascots, rather than the Paralympic flag or organization logos.
Noggi and Joggi, the mascots of the 1980 Summer Paralympics are possibly the first Paralympic mascots. However, since the 1988 Summer Paralympics, all of the Paralympic mascots have been associated with their Olympic counterparts.
