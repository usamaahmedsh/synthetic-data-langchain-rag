The Lebanese Olympic Committee was formed in 1947 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1948. Lebanon participated at the inaugural Olympic Games in 1948, and has competed in all but one Summer Olympic Games since then. Lebanon boycotted the 1956 Games in protest of the British and French involvement in the Suez Crisis. Lebanon has participated in most Winter Olympic Games since 1948, missing only the 1994 and 1998 Winter Games.
Lebanon made an appearance at the Olympics in 1936, without participating, when a "delegation of officials" attended the Summer Olympics in Berlin.
Lebanese athletes have won four medals, three in Greco-Roman wrestling and one in weightlifting.
In 2010, Lebanon participated at the first Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
