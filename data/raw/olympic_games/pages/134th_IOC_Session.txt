The 134th IOC Session was the IOC Session which was held in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 24 June 2019.


== Bidders ==
Milan, Italy was the sole bidder to host the 134th IOC Session and was elected in a unanimous vote at the 131st IOC Session in Lima in September 2017. However, in 2018 there was a late Italian bid to host the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo (which hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics). The Olympic Charter does not allow a session to take place in a country that has a candidate for the Olympic Games awarded at the session. Consequently, the IOC session was moved to the SwissTech Convention Center in Lausanne.


== 2026 Winter Olympics host city election ==
The host city of the 2026 Winter Olympics was elected at the 134th IOC Session. Bids were submitted to the IOC in 2018.
