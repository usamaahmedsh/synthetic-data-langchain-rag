== History ==
The International Society of Olympic Historians was formed as the result of a meeting in London, England, in December 1991. The idea of forming an Olympic historical society had been the subject of correspondence – mainly between Bill Mallon (United States) and Ture Widlund (Sweden) – for many years. On Thursday, 5 December 1991, a group of potential members met at the Duke of Clarence, a small pub in the Kensington district.  Those present were Ian Buchanan (Great Britain), Stan Greenberg (Great Britain), Ove Karlsson (Sweden), Bill Mallon (United States), Peter Matthews (Great Britain), David Wallechinsky (United States), and Ture Widlund (Sweden). The invited guests who sent regrets were: Anthony Bijkerk (Netherlands), Peter Diamond (United States), Pim Huurman (Netherlands), Erich Kamper (Austria), Volker Kluge (Germany), John Lucas (United States), and Wolf Lyberg (Sweden). 
ISOH was formed with the purpose of promoting and studying the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Games. This purpose is achieved primarily through research into their history,  the gathering of historical and statistical data concerning the Olympic Movement and Olympic Games and the publication of the research via journals and other publications, and through the cooperation of the membership.
Ian Buchanan was the first  ISOH. In 2000,he was succeeded by Bill Mallon. Subsequently the sports historian and academic Dr. Karl Lennartz (Germany) was elected President, serving from 2004 to 2012.Broadcaster and writer  David Wallechinsky (United States) led the organisation from 2012 to 2020. Since then, archaeologist and sports historian Dr. Christian Wacker (Germany) has been president.
