The 2027 Island Games (Faroese: Oyggjaleikir 2027), known as the Betri Island Games (Betri Oyggjaleikir) for sponsorship purposes, are an upcoming edition of the Island Games to be hosted in the Faroe Islands. They are planned to take place from 3–9 July 2027, and 24 island teams are expected to participate.


== Host ==
The 2027 edition of the Island Games were initially planned to be hosted in Ynys Môn, but Ynis Môn backed out on account of financial pressure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. In December 2023, it was announced that the Faroe Islands would replace Ynis Môn as the hosts. The 2027 Games will be the second time that the Faroe Islands have hosted the Island Games, the first time being in 1989.


== Sports ==
Fourteen sports are planned to be included in the 2027 Games. Judo, basketball, shooting, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, and beach volleyball are all returning to the Games after not being present at the 2025 Island Games in Orkney. Golf, sailing, bowls, and squash were dropped from the 2027 itinerary.
