The 2025 Asian Youth Para Games (Arabic: الألعاب الأسيوية البارالمبية للشباب 2025), officially known as the 5th Asian Youth Para Games, will be an Asian youth disabled multi-sport event held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates from 7 to 14 December 2025. This will be the second time Dubai has hosted the games. Around 1,312 athletes from 35 participating nations will participate in the games, featuring 11 sports.


== Host selection ==
On 3 August 2023, the Asian Paralympic Committee awarded the 2025 Asian Youth Para Games hosting rights to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. This would mark the first time that the Asian Youth Games and Para Games will be hosted in the same city under the same Organising Committee, following the format of Asian Games and Asian Para Games. However, after Tashkent's exit as hosts, Dubai was awarded the hosting rights for the 2025 edition.
