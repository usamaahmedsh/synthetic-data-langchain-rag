The 2023 National Games of Pakistan was the 34th edition of the National Games of Pakistan. The event was held in Quetta, with some disciplines taking place in Islamabad, Jhelum, Karachi, and Lahore. Quetta hosted the Games for the first time since 2004, when the city hosted the 29th edition. The Balochistan Sports Department hosted the event in collaboration with the Pakistan Olympic Association.
The Games was officially opened on 22 May 2023 by Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, the Chief Minister of Balochistan. The President of Pakistan, Arif Alvi, was the chief guest of the closing ceremony on 30 May 2023.

Quetta was originally scheduled to hold the event in 2012, but could not do so due to various reasons. As a result, Peshawar was selected to host the 33rd edition of the Games in 2019. In January 2023, the Pakistan Olympic Association announced that the event was scheduled to be held in Quetta from 15 to 23 May 2023. But it was postponed for a week due to the 2023 Punjab provincial election.
