The 4th European Games (Turkish: 4. Avrupa Oyunları), also known as the 2027 European Games or Istanbul 2027 (Turkish: İstanbul 2027), is an upcoming fourth edition of the European Games planned to be held in 2027 in Istanbul, Turkey.


== Host selection ==
In October 2022, leading officials at the European Olympic Committees (EOC) claimed that they are closing in on securing a host for the 2027 European Games. Spain, France and Portugal had been touted as potential bidders. Split, Croatia had also expressed in interest in hosting the games.
In October 2023, Istanbul indicated it intends to host the 2027 European Games and the 2027 European Para Championships, as part of a long-term bid to host the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Plans to bring back gymnastics and swimming events to the 2027 games were also revealed. Istanbul's goal for the games was a result of bidding for the 2000, 2008, and 2020 Summer Olympics, but they were ultimately defeated by Sydney, Beijing, and Tokyo.
A delegation from Istanbul presented their plans to host the 2027 games at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the EOC on 7 February 2024 in Madrid. Following the presentation, EOC president Spyros Capralos stated that Istanbul had the necessary infrastructure to host the games, and he was planning to visit the city to discuss the bid further. The EOC officially confirmed Istanbul as host city on 27 March 2024, which was announced during a press conference organised by Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem İmamoğlu. On 16 May 2024, a committee from Turkey, accompanied by İmamoğlu, flew to Italy, where parties signed an agreement that formalised the Host City Contract, officially setting that Istanbul will host the 4th European Games.
On 28 February 2025, the European Olympic Committees, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, and the Turkish National Olympic Committee signed the Host City Contract at the 54th EOC General Assembly in Frankfurt.
