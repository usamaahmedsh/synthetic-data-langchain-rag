=== Proposed bids which did not go to application ===
These cities launched bids or indicated interest, but ultimately did not bid .

 Adelaide, Australia
State Opposition Leader Martin Hamilton-Smith committed to a bid for the 2018 Commonwealth Games if the Liberals were elected in 2010. However, the bid would have needed to be made before the poll. The government ruled the option out, with the then treasurer, Kevin Foley, labeling the Commonwealth games a "B" grade event. On 28 November 2008, Adelaide withdrew, with State Sport Minister Michael Wright blaming budgetary pressures. Projects such as Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital (since renamed to the new Royal Adelaide Hospital, the desalination plant, and transport were deemed more pressing.
 Perth, Australia
Perth confirmed in 2009 that it would not pursue a bid to hold the games in 2018.
 Abuja, Nigeria
 
Abuja previously bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and finished as runners-up. They also announced an intention to bid for 2018, but did not do so at the deadline.
 Auckland, New Zealand
Auckland's bid to stage the 2018 Commonwealth Games ended when the government of New Zealand announced they would not provide financial support to stage the games. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key confirmed that the government would not back Auckland's bid. Key said that the issue was not the cost of the bid itself, but how much it would cost to run the event. He said New Zealand would face a NZ$600 million loss, even taking into account benefits such as increased tourism, if it were to go ahead.
 Christchurch, New Zealand
According to a 2009 report by Radio New Zealand, Christchurch City Council withdrew from bidding for the 2018 games.
 Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago
Port of Spain launched a bid, but ultimately the Trinidad and Tobago Commonwealth Games Association decided not to proceed with the process. The country later won the right to host the 2021 Commonwealth Youth Games in the same city.
