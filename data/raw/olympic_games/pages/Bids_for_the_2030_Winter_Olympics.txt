The selection of the host for the 2030 Winter Olympics saw a new process being introduced from 2019. The bidding process saw the French Alps, France, chosen as the preferred and expected host that was officially certified by the IOC before the 2024 Summer Olympics on 24 July 2024 in Paris, France.


== Bidding process ==
The new IOC bidding process was approved at the 134th IOC Session on 24 June 2019 in Lausanne, Switzerland. The key proposals, driven by the relevant recommendations from Olympic Agenda 2020, were:

Establish a permanent, ongoing dialogue to explore and create interest among cities/regions/countries and National Olympic Committees for any Olympic event
Create two Future Host Commissions (Summer and Winter Games) to oversee interest in future Olympic events and report to the IOC executive board
Give the IOC Session more influence by having non-executive board members form part of the Future Host Commissions.
The IOC also modified the Olympic Charter to increase its flexibility in choosing hosts by making the date of elections more flexible and allowing multiple cities, regions, or countries to host instead of only single cities, regions, or countries.


=== Future host winter commissions ===
The full composition of the winter commissions, which oversaw interested hosts or engage with potential hosts with which the IOC may want to create interest, was as follows:


=== Dialogue stages ===
According to the Future Host Commission's rules of conduct, the new IOC bidding system is divided into 2 dialogue stages:


==== Continuous dialogue ====
Non-committal discussions between the IOC and interested parties (City/Region/Country/NOC interested in hosting) with regard to hosting future Olympic events.
During the Olympic Summit on 9 December 2022, the IOC informed that they remained in "Continuous Dialogue" with several well-developed projects by parties that had expressed interest in the 2030 Olympic Winter Games and with whom intense collaboration was ongoing. The Summit was also informed that the commission was looking into challenges and opportunities facing future Olympic Winter Games, such as the impact of climate change. A number of proposals that could have an impact on future elections were discussed, including rotation of the Games within a certain pool of hosts, minimum climate conditions, and existing infrastructure criteria.
Upon the request of the commission, the IOC Executive Board decided to give the Commission more time to study all these factors to make the best possible decisions about future hosting, including a revised 2030 election timeframe.


==== Targeted dialogue ====
Targeted discussions with one or more interested parties (called preferred host(s)), as instructed by the IOC Executive Board. This follows a recommendation by the Future Host Commission as a result of continuous dialogue.
Following a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s Future Host Commission for the Olympic Winter Games, the IOC Executive Board (EB) on 29 November 2023 invited the French National Olympic Committee (CNOSF) into "Targeted Dialogue" towards hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games 2030 in the French Alps.


=== Host selection ===
The French Alps was confirmed as host of the 2030 Winter Olympics at the 142nd IOC Session on 24 July 2024 in Paris, France. As per the new format of choosing future Olympic Games host cities from the IOC's Agenda 2020, the vote was in a form of a referendum to the 95 IOC delegates.


== Developments ==
The decision on the 2030 Winter Olympics host city was delayed until 24 July 2024, to allow the IOC more time to carefully plan the future of the Winter Olympics. Due to impacts from climate change and other economic factors, the IOC began studying a number of changes to future games, such as rotating host cities, limiting the games to existing or temporary venues, and establishing minimum average temperature requirements. It also considered awarding the 2030 and 2034 winter games simultaneously at the next IOC session, but IOC President Thomas Bach had ruled out that possibility because "it would not be the right thing to do." However, at the 141st IOC Session in Mumbai, where these games were originally set to be awarded, the IOC approved to award both the 2030 and 2034 Winter Olympics at the 142nd IOC Session in Paris on the eve of the 2024 Summer Olympics.
