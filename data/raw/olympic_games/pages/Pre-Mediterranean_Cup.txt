The Pre-Mediterranean Cup (Greek: Προμεσογειακό Κύπελλο) was an association football tournament hosted by the HFF. It was a friendly tournament that was held for financial purposes. Its name occurred from the fact that it took place before the start of the 1991 Mediterranean Games. The competition was conducted once, in 1991 and the winners were AEK Athens.
In June 1991, the Pre-Mediterranean Cup was held in order to financially support mainly the clubs that competed in the Alpha Ethniki. The clubs that declared their participation had expectations from the ticket sales and would receive a 32.5% of the revenues from PRO-PO, as well. It was conducted with the participation of the 1990–91 Alpha Ethniki clubs, plus the 1990–91 Beta Ethniki champion, Ethnikos Piraeus. Nevertheless, Olympiacos, Panathinaikos and PAOK did not participate, due to the fatigue of their footballers from the constant league games. The tournament had duration of two matchdays that took place within a week. The club with the most points would win the Cup. In case of a tie, the goal difference criterion was applied. The end of tournament found AEK Athens, Levadiakos and Doxa Drama tied at the top with 4 points each, having won both of their matches. According to the regulation, AEK Athens, who had the best goal difference (6–2), emerged as the winners.
The point system was: Win: 2 points - Draw: 1 point - Loss: 0 points.
