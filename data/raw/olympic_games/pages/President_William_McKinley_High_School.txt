McKinley has fielded girls teams in basketball, volleyball, and swimming as early as in the 1910s. Some years even fielded girls baseball team before softball became recognized as its own sport. The yearbooks of those early years noted games often against St. Andrew's Priory, YWCA, Palama, Normal School (later merged with University of Hawaiʻi's College of Education), and even College of Hawaii (now known as University of Hawaiʻi). McKinley was a founding member of the Interscholastic League of Honolulu in 1909 alongside Punahou and Kamehameha. In 1970, McKinley left the ILH with four other Honolulu area public schools to join the Oahu Interscholastic Association.
The 1933 football team traveled across the Pacific Ocean and went on to defeat Weber College (now known as Weber State University), Brigham Young University freshmen team, and Ricks College (now known as Brigham Young University–Idaho). Ricks College traveled to Honolulu the following year. McKinley won again by the score of 24–6 in a game attended by about 19,000 fans.
