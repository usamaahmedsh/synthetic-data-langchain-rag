The slogan of the Games is "Our Strength Lies in the Commonwealth!" (В Содружестве наша сила!)


== Development and preparation ==
The Games were officially introduced on 27 June 2019, after an initiative of the Ministry of Sport of Russia was passed to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who accepted it. Initially, the Games were due to take place from 20 to 27 September 2020, but they were finally postponed to next year after a series of postponements due to complications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to Business Online, in 2020 the Games' expenses would have been around 500 million rubles, 80% of which would have been covered by the Federal Center.
On 12 July 2021, in an online meeting of leaders of sport ministries it was announced, that around 2,000 athletes, for the most part aged between 14 and 23, and 600 officials will participate at the Games.

On 28 July 2021, Rustam Minnikhanov, President of Tatarstan, headed a session of the Republican Organization Committee. There it was announced, that about 1,500 athletes will participate.

=== Logo and mascot ===

The Games' official logo was the firebird (жар-птица), a common Slavic fairytale character which is also common in other cultures. The official mascot was а bars, a (snow) leopard. The firebird symbolizes freedom, speed, height, as it is skyrocketing skyward. It is also a symbol of hospitality and the diverse cultures living in the CIS territory. Each feather is coloured according to the flags of the CIS nations. The design of the mascot was created by Ibragim Durdiev from Moscow. The snow leopard has been the symbol of the Volga Bulgars, who were also known as the "Bars tribe" or "barsils". For them, the bars was a deity of fertility and the defence of children. It should symbolize energy, agility, strength and the will to win, as well as hospitality and fortune.
