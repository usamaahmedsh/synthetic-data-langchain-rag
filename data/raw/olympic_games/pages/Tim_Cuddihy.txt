There, he faced Hiroshi Yamamoto of Japan, losing to the eventual silver medalist in a 10–9 tie-breaker after the first 12 arrows resulted in a 115–115 tie.  Cuddihy then competed against Laurence Godfrey of Great Britain in the bronze medal match, winning 113–112 to earn the bronze medal. Cuddihy was also a member of the 6th-place Australian men's archery team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.
