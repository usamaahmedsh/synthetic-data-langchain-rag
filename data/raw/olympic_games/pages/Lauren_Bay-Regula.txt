== Early life ==
Regula is originally from Trail, British Columbia, where she began playing softball at age 12.


== Oklahoma State Cowgirls ==
As a freshman, she broke into the Oklahoma State Cowgirls top-10 season records in strikeouts, innings pitched and was selected Second Team All-Big 12.
On March 8, 2001, Bay-Regula threw her first career no-hitter, defeating the FIU Golden Panthers.
For her junior season, Bay-Regula threw two perfect games, the first on February 22, 2002, against the Tulsa Hurricanes. She would add one more as well as break the school records for strikeouts and strikeout ratio. Her wins, innings and shutouts were also all top-10 for a Cowgirl season in a First Team All-Big 12 year.
Bay-Regula's banner senior season boasted her fourth All-Big 12 selection, Big 12 Player of the Year and First Team All-American honors.
She posted her career-best strikeout ratio (12.7, at the time was the NCAA fourth best season ratio), strikeouts and WHIP totals, two of which broke her own school records and remain tops. Bay-Regula's ERA, wins and shutouts, all rank in the top 10 for a school season and also were career bests. Bay-Regula would rank top-5 in ERA, strikeouts and opponents' batting average for the season in the Big 12, all of those marks remain top-10 conference records.
On March 7, 2003, Bay-Regula tied the school single-game record for strikeouts when she fanned 17 in regulation against the Maryland Terrapins.
The win would also kick off a career-best 10 consecutive game win streak that was broken by the Oklahoma Sooners on April 2. In the last game of the next day on the 8th, the win was a 10-inning duel with Courtnay Foster of the Northwestern Wildcats with the two combining for 33 strikeouts and Bay-Regula tallying the 1,000th of her career.
Later that month on March 16, she broke and set the single-game record with 23 strikeouts in 11 innings, defeating the Kansas Jayhawks with a game-winning RBI hit and after the fourth pitching a complete game no-hitter to begin a 27.1 consecutive scoreless inning streak.
The total tied the NCAA fourth best single-game effort for strikeouts and now stands 6th all-time; as well the game featured 31 combined strikeouts with opposing pitcher Kara Pierce. The scoreless streak was snapped by the Tulsa Hurricanes when they scored in Bay-Regula's fourth inning of relief, the Cowgirls eventually won that contest in extras on March 26. She had pitched 5 games, two complete with 54 strikeouts and surrendering only three hits and 7 walks for a 0.37 WHIP.
Bay-Regula would leave with career top-10 records in wins, ERA, shutouts, innings pitched while setting and still claiming the strikeouts and strikeout ratio crowns. For the Big 12, she ranks top-10 in career ERA (8th) and strikeouts (4th).
