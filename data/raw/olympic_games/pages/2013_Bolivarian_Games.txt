The 2013 Bolivarian Games (Spanish: Juegos Bolivarianos), officially the XVII Bolivarian Games, was a major international multi-sport event that was held from November 16–30, 2013, in Trujillo, Peru, with some events held in Lima and Chiclayo. Approximately 4,500 athletes from 11 nations participated in 44 sports. These Games was the third Bolivarian Games that was hosted by Peru. Previously, Peru hosted the 1947–48 Bolivarian Games and the 1997 Bolivarian Games. Since 2011, Trujillo was preparing the sport buildings for the Bolivarian Games.
The 2013 Bolivarian Games was the first one to have athletes from 11 countries, instead of the usual 6 members of the Bolivarian Sports Organization (ODEBO).


== Host city election ==

The Bolivarian Sports Organization (ODEBO) selected initially Panama City as the host for the 17th Bolivarian Games on May 5, 2010. ODEBO selected the city, after both opposing bids from Venezuela and Ecuador were dismissed. Venezuela's bid fell through, due to not getting general support from then Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. Ecuador's bid was just not handed in on time, in order to be an official one.
On October 20, 2010, ODEBO decided to withdraw Panama City as host,  .ODEBO explained that Panama's Olympic Committee has actually two committees with two co-presidents in conflict, Miguel Vanegas and Miguel Sánchiz, one recognized by Panama's Supreme Court of Justice and the other one recognized by IOC. Ricardo Martinelli, Panama's president, commented: "I'm going to kill both of them... I will publicly ask both of them to hand over their resignations for the good of this country and stop with their petty personal interests.
Early 2011, Trujillo began to bid, to replace Panama City, as host of the 2013 Bolivarian Games. ODEBO's Games commission traveled to the Peruvian city to make a visual inspection of its facilities. The review found that Trujillo is capable of hosting the Games and unofficially stated that the city will host the 2013 Bolivarian Games. The official announcement was given on February 7, 2012, in Rio de Janeiro. Trujillo city will house about 4000 athletes from 11 countries in a modern sports complex.
