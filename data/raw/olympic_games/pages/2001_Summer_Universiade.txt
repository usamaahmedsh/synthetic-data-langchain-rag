The 2001 Summer Universiade, also known as the XXI Summer Universiade, was an international multi-sport event that took place in Beijing, China, between 22 August and 1 September. Beijing also hosted the 1990 Asian Games. A total of 6,757 athletes from 165 nations took part in 12 sports. The hosts, China, topped the medal table for the first time, with a total of 103 medals and 54 gold medals (more than twice the number of gold- medals won by the United States, in second place).
The event was also considered a rehearsal for the 2008 Beijing Olympics due to the announcement that Beijing would host the 2008 Olympic Games, which was made one month before the Opening Ceremony of the Universiade.
