== History ==

Before independence during the French Algeria period, the Algerian athletes were participating with France, among the most famous, the gold medalists Boughera El Ouafi in 1928, Alain Mimoun in 1956 and many others.
After independence in 1962, Algeria participated in the Olympic Games for the first time at the 1964 Summer Olympics with gymnast Mohamed Lazhari. 
Algeria withdrew from the 1976 Summer Olympics due to the refusal of the IOC to ban countries who had competed in South Africa amidst its apartheid policies. Almost every nation in Africa participated in the boycott. South Africa itself had been banned from the Olympics since 1964.
In the 1980 Summer Olympics Algeria participated for the first time in a team sport, competing in both football and handball. Their first medal came at the 1984 Summer Olympics, where Mustapha Moussa won bronze in boxing.
