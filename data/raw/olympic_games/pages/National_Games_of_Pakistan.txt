The National Games of Pakistan is a multi-sport event held in Pakistan. It comprises various disciplines in which sportsmen from the provinces and departments of Pakistan compete against each other. The games are organized by Pakistan Sports Board, Pakistan Olympic Association, and the host province.
Pakistan Army have dominated the Games throughout their history, having won 28 of the 34 official editions. Lahore has hosted the Games ten times, more than any other city.


== History ==
Before the Independence of Pakistan, the Indian chapter of the Olympic movement was founded in 1924. The founder was Hassan, the first Secretary of the Punjab Olympic Association. Lt. Col. H.L.O. Garrett, vice principal of Government College, Lahore, was the President of the founding body. At the same time, the Indian Olympic Games were organized in Delhi, Calcutta, and Lahore, the then capital of undivided Punjab.
The Games were held every two years from 1924 as Indian Olympic Games and were renamed as National Games when they were first held in Bombay in 1940.


=== Post-independence ===
After the independence of Pakistan, the first National Games were held at Polo Ground, Karachi from 23 to 25 April 1948. The games were organized by Ahmed E.H. Jaffar, the first President of the Pakistan Olympic Association.
Sportsmen and officials from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and all the integrated Provincial units of West Pakistan took part in these Games. The total number of athletes was 140. No competitors were, however, invited from any foreign country. Competitions were held in track and field, basketball, boxing, cycling, volleyball, weightlifting, and wrestling. 
The overall championship was won by the Punjab contingent.


== The Quaid-i-Azam Trophy ==
The inaugural edition of the National Games was opened by the founder and Governor-General of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He donated a "Challenge Shield" from his private funds. The trophy is now named as the "Quaid-i-Azam Trophy", and is awarded to the winning team in every edition.


== Organization ==
The National Games are required to be held once in two years leaving those years in which the Olympic Games and Asian Games are scheduled to be held, depending upon the situation in country. The Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) can allow relaxation from the general rule only in exceptional cases or natural calamity. The duration and the regulation of the National Games is entirely within the jurisdiction of POA.
The games are jointly organized by the Pakistan Sports Board, the Pakistan Olympic Association, and the provincial government of the host city.
