=== Host selection ===
Originally the 2021 ASEAN Para Games was intended to be held in Vietnam, the same host nation as the 2021 Southeast Asian Games. The games were planned amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam, posing logistical challenges in organizing the event.
Originally scheduled to be held from 17 to 23 December 2021, games were cancelled in October, as they planned after the 2021 SEA Games was postponed to May 2022 due to the pandemic. This would have been the second time Vietnam would have hosted the games, last staging them in 2003.
Malaysia and Indonesia expressed willingness to host the games in place of Vietnam. The Philippines has also supported moving the games to a country willing to host the games in a minor scale than the original.
In January 2022, Surakarta in Indonesia was announced as the host for the games. However,the host city contract could not be immediately signed due to  World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) sanctions in effect at the time. The hosting rights was only formally awarded to Indonesia on 16 February 2022 after the sanctions were lifted.


=== Venues ===
Almost all of the 2022 ASEAN Para Games held in Greater Solo (11 in Surakarta, 2 in Karanganyar). Originally, swimming also will be held in Karanganyar, but later moved to Semarang due to lack of preparation.
