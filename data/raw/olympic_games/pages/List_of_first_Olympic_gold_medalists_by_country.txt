The following table lists the first Olympic gold medal won by each National Olympic Committee (NOC).
James Brendan Connolly of the United States is credited as the first ever gold medalist of the modern Olympic Games.
In some cases, a NOC may garner multiple gold medals in the same edition where it won its first ever gold medal. Scheduling of events is a factor that plays a part in who is considered the first Olympic gold medalist for a nation.
Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist.
This article only considers gold medals in sports competitions, therefore those from art competitions are not included.
