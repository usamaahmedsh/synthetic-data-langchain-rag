Clermont is home to the 1956 Florida Citrus Tower, one of Florida's early landmarks.


== History ==
Before European colonization and settlement, the area which is today Clermont was originally inhabited by the indigenous Timucua people. Urriparacoxi was reportedly a chieftain in the area during the 1539-40 Hernando de Soto expeditions. The population of the Timucua were whittled by epidemics of infectious diseases introduced by Europeans, then by attacks and slave raids largely conducted under Spanish colonial rule.
After the collapse of Timucua society, the indigenous Seminole people came to inhabit the region. In 1819, Florida was acquired by the United States from Spain with the Adams–Onís Treaty. Four years later, the area of modern-day Clermont became a part of an Indian reservation under the Treaty of Moultrie Creek. The Seminole were ultimately ethnically cleansed by federal troops in the Seminole Wars or driven out on the Trail of Tears. The region was geographically called the High Sand Hills by Americans, according to maps by Washington Hood. The first white settlers arrived in the area in 1853, soon after the Seminole Wars.
Clermont was founded in 1884, and named for the French birthplace of A.F. Wrotnowski, manager of the Clermont Improvement Company, a company to develop land. The municipality was incorporated as a town from June 9, 1891, then disbanded on May 25, 1895. It was reincorporated as a city on December 28, 1916.
Much of the county was developed as orange and other citrus groves, which was the basis of the economy through the mid-20th century. Apshawa Groves, which owned and worked large expanses of land in the county, became a major real estate company. Tourism also became increasingly important.
The groves, which were the namesake of the Citrus Tower, dwindled rapidly because of recurrent freezes and suburban development in the late 20th century and into the 2000s. The regional economy shifted from agricultural production to real estate. The population growth attracted numerous companies to the area.
From 2000 to 2020, the population grew more than 250 percent amid real estate development and urban sprawl in Central Florida. This brought economic growth and big-box retail stores. Clermont was described as one of the fastest-growing cities in Central Florida of the time. In spring 2010, the Clermont Landings shopping center opened with 20 shops and restaurants and the city's first cinema. Increased pollution from runoff and residential development has hurt the city's lakes and other natural resources.
Since 2001, when Orlando Health, with Pure Athletics and USA Triathlon, opened the National Training Center in Clermont, the city has been noted for its training facilities for Olympic and college athletes. The Center later added a nearby facility for Special Olympics Florida. In 2014, the city sought to market itself as a training center by adopting the slogan "Choice of Champions" and a flag with Olympic rings. Twenty athletes who trained in Clermont went to the 2016 Rio Olympics; others went to the 2024 Paris Olympics.

=== Public library ===
The Cooper Memorial Library in Clermont is staffed by the Lake-Sumter State College and the Lake County Library System.
A salesman wandered into town in 1904, and spoke promises of donating books to start a library if the town helped him sell his Chautauqua lectures to residents. Many town members with money to spare put forth what they could, excited at the prospect of a library. However, when it came time for the lectures only a few of the speakers showed; no salesman or books were present. Not all money was handed over; the cost for the last lecture was still available, and with that amount they began to organize their own library. This was hosted in the Montrose Street home of Mrs. Payson Pierce, with the collection of books open to the town on Saturday afternoons. Patrons paid 50 cents a year. The Clermont Library Club also hosted their meetings at Pierce's house. The growing collection was moved to Isiah Benson's Lake Avenue house in 1910, then to the Baptist Church the following year.
In the summer of 1914, the Friends of the Library raised $600 to erect a one-room building on 630 DeSoto Street, a lot donated by Alice Cooper. The library was funded by the club and its small circulating collection staffed by Clermont Women's Club volunteers until the city took over in the 1950s and the Cooper Memorial Library Association was formed to administer the public library. In 1980, a former bank building was purchased. A human chain of town volunteers passed the books, hand to hand, from the old to the new location. Mike Delaney, a Friends of the Library member, said, "It was an amazing honor to be part of the early book brigade when I was seven...It was an experience that I will never forget that brought the community together". In 1984, the building was expanded by more than 4,000 square feet, adding the Florida Room and Children's Room. In 1982, the Cooper Memorial Library joined the Lake County Library System, and is the only continuous member of that system.
