The III South American Games (Spanish: Juegos Sudamericanos; Portuguese: Jogos Sul-Americanos) were a multi-sport event held in 1986 in Santiago, Chile, with some events in Concepción and Viña del Mar. The Games were organized by the South American Sports Organization (ODESUR) and were initially awarded to Brazil at its 1982 congress held in Rosario.  However, four months later, Brazil declined the offer.  Therefore, Guayaquil and Quito in Ecuador were chosen, but due to lack of government support the games were finally moved to Santiago, Chile.
