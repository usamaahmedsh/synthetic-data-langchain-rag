The 1968 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XIX Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Mexico City, from 12 to 27 October. A total of 5,516 athletes from 112 nations participated in 172 events in 18 sports across 24 different disciplines. These were the first games to be held in Latin America.
Overall, athletes from 44 nations received at least one medal, and 39 nations won at least one gold medal. Athletes from the United States won the most gold medals, with 45, and the most medals overall, with 107. Teams from East Germany and West Germany won their nations' first Summer Olympic medals of every color at their first Summer Olympic appearance. Teams from Kenya, Tunisia, and Venezuela won their nations' first Olympic gold medals, while athletes from Cameroon, Mongolia, and Uganda won their nations' first Olympic medals.
Artistic gymnast Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia was the most successful competitor at the games, winning six medals (four gold and two silver). After her gold medal wins at these games, Čáslavská held the record for the most individual Olympic gold medals by a female athlete with seven, until Katie Ledecky of the United States surpassed it at the 2024 Summer Olympics with eight. Artistic gymnast Mikhail Voronin of the Soviet Union won the most total medals at the games with seven (two golds, four silvers, and one bronze).


== Medal table ==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. Two bronze medals were awarded in each boxing event to the losing semi-finalists, as opposed to them fighting in a third place tiebreaker.
In gymnastics, two gold medals (and no silver medal) were awarded in the men's horizontal bar and women's floor exercise due to a first-place tie in both events.
