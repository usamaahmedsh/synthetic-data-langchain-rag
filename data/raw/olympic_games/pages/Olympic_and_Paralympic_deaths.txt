At the modern Olympic Games, as of the conclusion of the 2024 Summer Paralympics, eight Olympic or Paralympic athletes and six horses have died as a result of competing in or practicing their sport at Games venues; three other deaths were potentially a result of competition. In addition, another 16 participants have died at the Olympics from other causes; 11 of these deaths were from the Munich massacre.
Several incidents related to the Olympics have caused the death of non-participants. Large numbers were killed during the Lima football riot of 1964 and the Tlatelolco massacre in Mexico City in 1968. The Centennial Olympic Park bombing at the 1996 Atlanta Games killed two people.
