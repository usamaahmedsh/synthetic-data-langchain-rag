Saïd Aouita (Arabic: سعيد عويطة; born November 2, 1959) is a former Moroccan track and field athlete. He is the only athlete in history to have won a medal in each of the 800 meters and 5000 meters at the Olympic games. He won the 5000 meters at the 1984 Summer Olympics and the 1987 World Championships in Athletics, as well as the 3000 meters at the 1989 IAAF World Indoor Championships. He is a former world record holder over 1500 metres (3:29.46), 2000 m (4:50.81), 3000 m (7:29.45), and twice at 5000 m (13:00.40 and 12:58.39).


== Early life and education ==
Saïd Aouita was born on November 2, 1959, in Kenitra, a coastal Moroccan city. Nine years later, he moved along with his family to Fes due to the nature of his father's work. As a child he spent most of his time playing football and wanted to be a great footballer; however, his outstanding skills in running made his coaches foresee a great future in track and field.
Aouita has a Bachelor of Science degree in Management and master's degree in Business Administration. He is pursuing a doctorate in Sport Management and Leadership.


== Running career ==
Aouita had his first start towards stardom at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics held in Helsinki. He contested  the 1500 m and finished third in the final, taking the bronze medal, after the pace slowed in the last 1000 meters and then finished with a sprint.
In 1984, Aouita decided to run the 5000 m at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Antonio Leitão from Portugal ran in first for the majority of the race. Aouita stayed behind Leitão and then sprinted past him on the last lap to win.
In 1985, Aouita ran two world records: first in 5000 m (13:00.40) in Oslo on 27 July, then in 1500 m (3:29.46) on 23 August.
In 1986 he missed setting the world record in the 3000 m by 0.44 of a second.
In 1987, Aouita's main objective was to excel in the world championship held in Rome and break records.  First, he broke the 2000 m world record with a time of 4:50.81 in Paris and only six days later, he surprised the world by breaking his own world record for 5000 m, becoming the first man to go under 13 minutes, with a time of 12:58.39 minutes. For the 1987 World Championships in Athletics, Aouita decided just to contest the 5000 m. In the 5000 m final, John Ngugi from Kenya set a fair pace, but by no means fast. Aouita, always in control of the race, made his move just before the bell, leading a mass sprint for the finish that he won in 13:26.44.
In 1988, at the 1988 Summer Olympics, he attempted to race in the 800 m and 1500 m but had a hamstring injury which made him finish third in 800 m and withdraw from the 1500 m although he had qualified for the semi-final. In spite of that his bronze medal made him the only athlete in history to combine medals at both 800 m and 5000 m.
In 1989, Aouita won the 3000 m at the 1989 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest. Later that year, he broke the world record for the same distance in Köln, Germany with the time of 7:29.45 and thus, he was the first man in history to go under 7:30:00.
Aouita was a versatile middle and long distance runner, excelling at distances between 800 m and 10,000 m during the eighties. He raced and won against the Olympic champions Joaquim Cruz (800 m), Peter Rono (1500 m), John Ngugi (5000 m) and Alberto Cova (10000 m) over their respective main distances. Between September 1983 and September 1990 he won 115 of his 119 races. The defeats were against world champion Steve Cram over 1500 m, Olympic bronze medalist Alessandro Lambruschini over 3000 m steeplechase, Olympic champions Joaquim Cruz and Paul Ereng over 800 m and world champion Yobes Ondieki over 5000 m.
In the early nineties, Aouita underwent surgery on his leg, after which his doctors advised him to put an end to his career as an athlete for his health. After a set of failures in a number of races he decided to retire from athletics.


== Personal life ==
Said Aouita married Khadija Skhir in 1983, one year before the 1984 Olympic Games. Together they have four children: one son, Adil, and three daughters; Soukaina, Sarah, and Zeena.
After his athletics career ended, Aouita worked with mixed success as a consultant for numerous sport institutions, as Technical National Manager in Morocco, and National Distance Coach in Australia thanks not only to his fruitful field experience, but also to his academic competences. Now, Aouita is working as Senior Analyst for Al Jazeera Sports channel. Aouita also has a sports clothing company which was established in 2009.
Aouita is featured on an Azerbaijani postage stamp.
He lives in Orlando, Florida.
