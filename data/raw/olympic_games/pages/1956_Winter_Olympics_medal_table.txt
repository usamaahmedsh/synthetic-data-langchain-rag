The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VII Olympic Winter Games, was an international multi-sport event held in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from 26 January to 5 February 1956.

Teams from Poland and Japan won their nations' first Winter Olympic medals.
Alpine skier Toni Sailer of Austria won the most gold medals for an individual at the Games.

Cross-country skier Sixten Jernberg of Sweden won the most overall medals for an individual at the Games, winning four medals with one gold, two silvers, and one bronze.


== Medal table ==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.
In speed skating, two gold medals (and no silver) were awarded to Yevgeny Grishin and Yuri Mikhaylov for a first-place tie in the men's 1500 metres event.
