Hence, the 5th ASEAN Para Games was instead held five months ahead of the Laos 2009 Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 15 to 19 August 2009, featuring 409 events in 11 sports.


== Development and preparation ==
The Kuala Lumpur Asean Para Games Organising Committee (KLAPGOC) was formed to oversee the staging of the event.

=== Logo ===
 
The logo of the 2009 ASEAN Para Games is an image of a heart shape surrounded by ten doves which represents the ten ASEAN nations. The initial KL in the logo represents Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia as the host of the games, the number ’09 represents the year 2009, the heart shape in the ‘0’ represents the loving, caring and hospitality of Malaysian people, while the brush stroke sphere represents the unity of the ASEAN Community. The Games logo is mostly rehashed from the 2006 FESPIC Games logo, and due to Malaysian athletes excellent performance at the 2006 FESPIC Games, the rehash of the 2006 FESPIC Games logo as the 2009 edition games logo is meant to reflect Malaysia's intention to replicate its 2006 FESPIC Games success at the 2009 ASEAN Para Games.


=== Mascot ===
The mascot of the 2009 ASEAN Para Games is a mousedeer named, "Ujang".  The mousedeer is a native animal in Malaysia locally known as pelanduk or kancil which is shy, but very agile and quick thinking. It is a favourite character in local folktales commonly known as "Sang Kancil", noted for its intelligence, wit, cunning feints and quick reaction to escape from all kinds of danger, especially from its enemies. The adoption of mousedeer as the games mascot is to represent the courage of the Paralympic athletes in overcoming challenges and the odds. The name of the mascot, Ujang is a common nickname for local Malay youths. Also, Ujang was used as the mascot of the 2001 ASEAN Para Games.
