The 1986 Asian Games (1986년 아시아 경기대회/1986년 아시안 게임), officially known as the 10th Asian Games and the X Asiad (제10회 아시아 경기대회/제10회 아시안 게임) and commonly known as Seoul 1986 (서울 1986), were held from 20 September to 5 October 1986, in Seoul, South Korea. The venues and facilities of the 10th Asiad were the same venues and facilities that would be used in the 1988 Summer Olympics, as it was considered a test event.
Seoul had previously been scheduled to host the 1970 games, but it received security threats from neighbouring North Korea, forcing it to give up hosting the games to previous 1966 host Bangkok, Thailand.

=== Boycotting countries ===

Communist states Mongolia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and South Yemen, as well as Burma, Syrian Arab Republic and Brunei Darussalam boycotted the Games in support of the North Korea failed proposal to host some events during the 1988 Summer Olympics. The only participating country from the Eastern Bloc, the People's Republic of China, which was set to host the next games in Beijing, did participate and sent a high profile delegation, and ultimately finished at the top of the medal table. Two years later, all except North Korea participated at the 1988 Summer Olympics, although Brunei sent only one official and no athletes.
