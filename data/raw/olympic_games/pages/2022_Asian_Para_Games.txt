North Korea withdrew from the games after the Asian Paralympic Committee refused to allow it to use their national symbols in compliance with sanctions by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). WADA imposed the sanction in October 2021 due to North Korea's non-compliance with doping regulations. This is in contrast with the 2022 Asian Games where North Korea was allowed to use its symbols by the Olympic Council of Asia in spite of the WADA sanctions.
