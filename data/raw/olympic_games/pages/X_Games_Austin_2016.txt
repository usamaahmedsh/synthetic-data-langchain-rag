X Games Austin 2016 was an action sporting event that took place June 2–5, 2016, at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas.
The 2016 Summer X Games would be the third event in a row to be held in Austin and the fourth full X Games event to be held in the state of Texas; in 2003, a special "Global Championships" event was held in San Antonio, Texas.
The 2016 X Games was broadcast again on ESPN and ABC. The event would have the return of BMX Street, Moto X Best Trick, Moto X Freestyle and Women's Skateboard Park competition. This was the last time that the X Games would be hosted at Circuit of the Americas citing the weather and finances as the reasons why the X Games would not return.
