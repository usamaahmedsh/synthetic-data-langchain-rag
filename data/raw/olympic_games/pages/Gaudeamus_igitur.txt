"Gaudeamus igitur" (Latin for "So let us rejoice") or just "Gaudeamus", also known as "De brevitate vitae" ("On the Shortness of Life"), is a popular academic commercium song in many European countries, mainly sung or performed at university graduation ceremonies. Despite its use as a formal graduation hymn, it is a jocular, light-hearted composition that pokes fun at university life. The song is thought to originate in a Latin manuscript from 1287. It is in the tradition of carpe diem ("seize the day") with its exhortations to enjoy life. It was known as a beer-drinking song in many early universities and is the official song of many schools, colleges, universities, institutions, student societies and is the official anthem of the International University Sports Federation.


== Content ==
The lyrics reflect an endorsement of the bacchanalian mayhem of student life while simultaneously retaining the grim knowledge that one day we will all die: memento mori. The song contains humorous and ironic references to sex and death, and many versions bowdlerising the text for performance in public ceremonies. In private, students will typically sing ribald words.
The song is sometimes known by its opening words, "Gaudeamus igitur" or simply "Gaudeamus". In the UK, it is sometimes affectionately known as "The Gaudie". The centuries of use have given rise to numerous slightly different versions.


=== Lyrics ===
The proposition that the lyrics originate in 1287 is based on a manuscript held in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. A poem starting with the words Subscribere proposui ("I have suggested signing (it)") has two verses that closely resemble the later "Gaudeamus igitur" verses, although neither the first verse nor the actual words Gaudeamus igitur appear. The music accompanying this poem bears no relation to the melody which is now associated with it. A German translation of these verses was made in about 1717 and published in 1730 without music. A Latin version in a handwritten student songbook, dating from some time between 1723 and 1750, is preserved in the Berlin State Library (formerly located at Marburg); however, this differs considerably from the modern text. The current Latin lyrics with a German translation were published by Halle in 1781 in Studentenlieder ("Students' Songs") written by Christian Wilhelm Kindleben (1748–1785), who admitted to making important changes to the text.
Below is Kindleben's 1781 Latin version, with two translations to English (one anonymous, and another by Tr. J. Mark Sugars, 1997). The Neo-Latin word Antiburschius refers to opponents of the 19th-century politically active German student fraternities.


=== Music ===

The first appearance in print of the present melody was in Lieder für Freunde der Geselligen Freude ("Songs for Friends of Convivial Joy"), published in Leipzig in 1782, together with Kindleben's German lyrics; however, the tune was evidently well known before this date. The first publication of the present Latin text together with the present melody was probably in Ignaz Walter's 1797 operatic setting of Goethe's Faust. It is also heard in Berlioz' La Damnation de Faust.
Johannes Brahms quoted the melody in the final section of his Academic Festival Overture, in a fortissimo rendition performed by the full orchestra.
Sigmund Romberg used it in the operetta The Student Prince, which is set at the University of Heidelberg.
It is quoted in Johann Strauss II's "Studenten-Polka" (Française, Op. 263), first performed at the students' ball at the ballroom in the Vienna Hofburg on 24 February 1862.
The tune is quoted, along with other student songs, in the overture of Franz von Suppé's 1863 operetta Flotte Bursche, the action being once again set at the University of Heidelberg.
Based on the original melody, Franz Liszt composed the "Gaudeamus igitur—Paraphrase" and later (1870) the "Gaudeamus igitur—Humoreske". Pyotr Tchaikovsky made an arrangement for male chorus with piano accompaniment (1874) (TH 187; ČW 413).
Tom Lehrer mentioned the Gaudeamus in his satirical song, "Bright College Days":

In 1979, New England Science Fiction Association member Joe Ross wrote a parody of the song, with lyrics referencing the 1955 film This Island Earth. The parody was titled "Haec Insula Terra" (a Latin translation of the film's title) and was published in the first volume of the NESFA Hymnal. Warwick Academy in Bermuda uses part of the lyrics as their school song.
