== Background ==
Cockburn was born in Toronto and grew up in North York, Ontario. She began trampolining at age 11, and was a student at York University. She is a member of the Skyriders Trampoline Place and is coached by Dave Ross.
Following the Lake Placid and Quebec City World Cup competitions that took place in April 2007, the FIG World Rankings were updated. The women's ranking saw four time World Champion and five time World Cup Final winner Irina Karavaeva of Russia retake top place from Cockburn in Women's Individual Trampoline after Karavaeva won the gold medal at both of the World Cups. Cockburn and her partner, Rosannagh MacLennan, were ranked first in Women's Synchronised Trampoline following their two winning performances in 2007.

After winning the Canadian National Trampoline Championships seven years in a row, Cockburn made an error in her second routine (of three) and came in 6th place in the 2005 finals on June 1, 2005. She was beaten by her partner in synchronized trampoline, Rosannagh MacLennan. Later in June, she competed in the Trampoline World Cup and came in 3rd in the individual competition and won gold in synchronized trampoline with Rosannagh MacLennan. In September 2005 at the Trampoline World Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands, the pair came 2nd in synchronized trampoline and Cockburn came 6th in the individual event.
In the 2006 Canadian National Trampoline championships in Quebec City, Cockburn regained her title beating MacLennan into second place, on May 20, 2006. On November 25, 2006, Cockburn won both the Individual gold medal and, with MacLennan, the synchronized gold medal at the Trampoline and Tumbling World Cup Final competition in Birmingham.

On June 7, 2008, Cockburn won her 10th Senior Women's Trampoline Canadian Championship in Calgary, beating MacLennan into second place. Both women, however, with Jason Burnett were named to compete for Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Following the 2008 Olympic Games, Cockburn did not compete again until the 2009 Canadian National Championships in Hamilton, Ontario. She came in second place after Rosannagh MacLennan. In the synchronised competition, she paired with MacLennan but they did not complete one routine and came in second place.
