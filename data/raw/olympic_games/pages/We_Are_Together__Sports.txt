Sport») was an international multi-sport tournament organized by the Russian Paralympic Committee. It was held from 18 to 21 March 2022 in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia.
The games were organized after Russia and Belarus were banned from the National Paralympic Committee-sanctioned 2022 Winter Paralympics in Beijing. The ban was a response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
