Turner Fenton Secondary School is a high school in the Peel Region, located in Brampton, Ontario, operated by the Peel District School Board. Turner Fenton Secondary School's name is inherited from two schools that were later merged, which were named after J. A. Turner, the first director of the Peel board, and W. J. Fenton, a pioneer educator.
