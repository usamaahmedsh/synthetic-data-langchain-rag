The 1971 Pan American Games, officially known as the VI Pan American Games (Spanish: VI Juegos Panamericanos) and commonly known as Cali 1971, were held in Cali, Colombia, from 30 July to 13 August 1971. (One source dates the Games from July 25 to August 8.) A total of 2,935 athletes from 32 countries participated in 17 sports. (One source put the number of competing athletes at 4,000.)


== Host city selection ==

Three cities submitted bids to host the 1971 Pan American Games that were recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization. On 22 July 1967, Cali was selected over Santiago and Champ, Missouri by a vote of 12 to 11 to 6, respectively, by PASO at its general assembly, held at the Manitoba Medical College in Winnipeg, Canada, to host the VI Pan American Games.

The main stadium was the Cali Olympic Stadium. Some events were held in the Coliseo El Pueblo. Boxing was staged in the Plaza de Toros Cañaveralejo, a Cali bullring. Some complaints were made about the barracks-style housing, which was woefully overcrowded. In an effort to protect the athletes from students who had protested the amount of money that Colombia was spending on the games, security-minded officials surrounded the athletes' village with barbed wire and guards carrying rifles.  The overcrowding caused it to be dubbed "Claustrophobia Manor" by the athletes. Other concerns centered on mosquitoes, the altitude, faulty plumbing, dysentery and pickpockets.
