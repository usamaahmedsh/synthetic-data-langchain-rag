== Background ==
The World Combat Games were founded by Global Association of International Sports Federations (then known as SportAccord) with the first rendition being held in Beijing, China in 2010. The 2013 rendition was then held in St. Petersburg, Russia. Following the demise of SportAccord due to conflicts with the International Olympic Committee after the 2013 games, the World Combat Games were halted. The World Martial Arts Masterships Committee was then created to continue the idea of a martial arts-only multi-sport event.
