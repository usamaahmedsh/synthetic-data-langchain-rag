Kuwait competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's twelfth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.
On May 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that Kuwaiti athletes would compete under the Olympic flag as Independent Olympic Athletes at the Olympics due to two-year suspension of the Kuwait Olympic Committee. On July 14, Kuwaiti athletes were allowed to participate under their own flag, after the suspension was lifted.
Kuwait Olympic Committee sent a total of 10 athletes to the Games, 8 men and 2 women, to compete in 4 different sports. Trap shooter Fehaid Al-Deehani, who participated at his sixth Olympics as the team's most experienced member, reprised his role to be Kuwait's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. He also set the nation's historical milestone, as the first Kuwaiti athlete to win more than a single medal in Olympic history.
