Chinese Taipei competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. "Chinese Taipei" was the designated name used by Taiwan to participate in some international organizations and almost all sporting events, including the Olympic Games.  Neither the common name "Taiwan" nor the official name "Republic of China" would be used primarily due to opposition from the People's Republic of China. This also was the nation's eighth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.
The Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games in Olympic history. A total of 89 athletes, 50 men and 39 women, competed only in 14 different sports. This was also the youngest delegation in Chinese Taipei's Olympic history, with more than half under the age of 25, and many of them were expected to reach their peak in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Baseball player Chen Chih-yuan was appointed by the committee to carry the Chinese Taipei flag in the opening ceremony.
Chinese Taipei left Athens with a total of five Olympic medals (two golds, two silver, and one bronze), being considered its most successful Olympics. Chinese Taipei's highlight of the Games came with a remarkable milestone for taekwondo jin Chen Shih-hsin and Chu Mu-yen, claiming the nation's first ever gold medals in Olympic history. Meanwhile, another taekwondo jin Huang Chih-hsiung picked up his second medal with a sterling silver in the men's lightweight division, adding it to his bronze from Sydney four years earlier.
