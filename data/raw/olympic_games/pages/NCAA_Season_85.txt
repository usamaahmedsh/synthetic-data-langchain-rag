NCAA Season 85 was the 2009–10 season of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) of the Philippines. The host for this year was San Beda College (SBC).
The season began on June 27 at the Araneta Coliseum with United States Ambassador to the Philippines Kristie Kenney delivered the keynote speech, followed by a tripleheader of seniors' basketball games. The juniors' basketball tournament tipped off at the San Juan Gym with the remaining first round of eliminations games in basketball held at the Filoil Flying V Arena. Other sporting events were held at Philippine Sports Commission venues such as the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.


== New member ==
With the Philippine Christian University (PCU) taking an indefinite leave of absence after the revelation of identity switching on their juniors' basketball team, the league began accepting candidates to take over PCU's spot. Emilio Aguinaldo College (EAC), Centro Escolar University (CEU), Angeles University Foundation (AUF), Arellano University and Lyceum of the Philippines University were the top candidates to join the league; other schools that were considered are Technological University of the Philippines and Don Bosco Technical College (a member of the NCAA South). Seeking to name a replacement before the year ends, the new school must have a high school varsity program, participate in all NCAA sports, undergo a three-year probationary period, and pay a PHP5 million membership fee.
Aside from assuring itself an 8-team roster for 2009, the league also envisions on having a 10-team league by 2010. PCU may still apply for membership but they will have to go through the same process as the other new applicants. League chairman for 2008-09 Ding Lozano of the Mapua Institute of Technology mentioned that Lyceum and EAC were the top contenders to be accepted in 2008.
On January 2, 2009, it was revealed that the choices were pared down to Lyceum, EAC and Arellano. However, after a month of delay, the policy board failed to garner a minimum number of votes to admit a new member; thus for this season, there will only be seven schools participating, while the schools that were considered will still be in contention for next season.
Prior to the Holy Week break, NCAA president Fr. Mat de Jesus, OSB announced that three schools were invited to compete as "guest teams" for the 2009–10 season, although he didn't mention the identities of the invited schools. Those that will accept invitations will still apply for full membership for the 2010–11 season. On April 21, newspapers announced that the three schools invited were Angeles University Foundation, Arellano University and Emilio Aguinaldo College. Lyceum's chances were said to be hurt with an absence of a high school varsity program. All three teams signified their intentions to participate as guest teams, paying the league 1.5 million pesos, plus a 500,000 peso-bond.
The Management Committee also decided that guest teams are eligible to win championships in the events they will participate at, and that their performance will be a part of their acceptance as full members.


== Demonstration sports ==
Olympic sports amateur boxing, archery and fencing will be contested as demonstration sports in the 2009–10 season. Boxing will be implemented with the help of the Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines, with its secretary-general Patrick Gregorio saying that it is a welcome development.
