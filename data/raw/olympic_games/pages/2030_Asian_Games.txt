The 2030 Asian Games (Arabic: دورة الألعاب الآسيوية 2030, romanized: Dawrat al-ʼAl‘ab al-Asīawīah 2030), officially known as the 21st Asian Games (Arabic: الـ21 من الآسياد, romanized: Al 21 mn-Alīsyad) and commonly known as Doha 2030 (Arabic: الدوحة 2030), will be the twenty-first edition of the Asian Games, a pan-Asian multi-sport event that is scheduled to be held from 4 to 19 November 2030 in Doha, Qatar.
Doha was elected as the host city at the 39th Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) General Assembly on 16 December 2020 in Muscat, Oman. These Games will be the second Asian Games to be held in Qatar, the second in Arabian Peninsula, the first of two consecutive Asian Games in the Arabian Peninsula, the following Games set to be the 2034 Asian Games in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Doha will be the fourth city to host the Asian Games twice, having previously hosted the 2006 Asian Games and will use again much of the infrastructure that was built for that event and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.


== Bidding process ==

The OCA voted on 16 December 2020 at the 39th OCA General Assembly in Muscat, Oman to select the host city. On 15 December 2020, OCA President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah announced that he would attempt to find a dual-host city solution to avoid a vote for the 2030 Asian Games, by persuading one city to host the event in 2030 and the other to organize the competition in 2034. On 16 December 2020, it was announced that Doha will host 2030 Games with the highest votes and Riyadh will host the 2034 Games. Saudi Arabia had asked the OCA to halt electronic voting on the host of the 2030 Asian Games due to "the possibility of technical fraud".
