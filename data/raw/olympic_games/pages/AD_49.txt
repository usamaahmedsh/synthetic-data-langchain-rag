AD 49 (XLIX) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Longus and Veranius (or, less frequently, year 802 Ab urbe condita). The denomination AD 49 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
