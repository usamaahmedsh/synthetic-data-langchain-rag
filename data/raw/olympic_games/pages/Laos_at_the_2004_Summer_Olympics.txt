Laos competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's sixth appearance at the Olympics, having attended every edition of the Olympiad since 1980 except the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, because of the Soviet boycott.
Five Laotian athletes were selected to the team by wild card entries in archery, athletics, and swimming, without having qualified. Sprinter Chamleunesouk Ao Oudomphonh was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. 
Laos has yet to win its first Olympic medal.
