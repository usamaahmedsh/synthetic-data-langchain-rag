NCAA Season 97 was the 2021–22 athletic year of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the Philippines hosted by De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde.


== Background ==
Colegio de San Juan de Letran's chairman awarded the Head of Sports Varsity and External Relation to the host by giving him the NCAA Flag and to host NCAA Season 97 in the closing ceremony. The Commission on Higher Education held a COVID-19 vaccination drive for the NCAA's student athletes which led the NCAA Management Committee (MANCOM) to seriously consider the return of face-to-face events after solely holding online events in the last season due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic.
The opening of season 97 was originally scheduled to begin on March 5, 2022 but was postponed to March 26, 2022 and tipped-off at St. Benilde Gym.
