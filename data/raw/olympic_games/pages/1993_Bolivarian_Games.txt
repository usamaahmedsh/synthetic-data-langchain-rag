The XII Bolivarian Games (Spanish: Juegos Bolivarianos) were a multi-sport event held between April 24 - May 2, 1993, in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. The Games were organized by the Bolivarian Sports Organization (ODEBO).
There were two opening ceremonies that took place on April 24, 1993, at the Estadio Félix Capriles in Cochabamba, and at the Estadio Ramón Tahuichi Aguilera in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.
