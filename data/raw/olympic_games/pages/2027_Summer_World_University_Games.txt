The 2027 FISU Summer World University Games, also known as Chungcheong 2027, is a multi-sport event scheduled from 1 to 12 August 2027 in the cities of the historical Chungcheong Province, South Korea. The region was confirmed as the host for the Games on 12 November 2022. This will be the third time that the event will be held in South Korea, after Daegu in 2003 and Gwangju in 2015.


== Bidding process ==
Chungcheong Region (South Korea) and North Carolina (United States) were the candidates in the running to host the 2027 edition. Chungcheong was selected on 12 November 2022 at the FISU executive committee in Brussels, Belgium, while North Carolina was awarded the 2029 edition.

== Sports ==
In addition to the 15 compulsory sports, up to three optional sports can be chosen, while respecting the infrastructure and local demands. The bid committee originally proposed rowing and sailing as optional sports. This would have been the third time in a row that rowing has been chosen as an optional sport, as it was in 2021 and 2025, while sailing was planned to return after for the first time since 2019. Despite this, infrastructure issues led to changes in plans and the Organizing Committee reviewed its planning in 2024, and decided that, in respect with local demands, retained rowing and replaced sailing and football (the latter of which was excluded from the program in staring in 2021) with golf (which returns after 2017) and beach volleyball, which remains in this status for two consecutive editions. On 12 January 2025, it was announced that para taekwondo will be part of the program.
