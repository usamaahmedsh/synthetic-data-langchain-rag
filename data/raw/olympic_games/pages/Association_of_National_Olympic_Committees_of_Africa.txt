The Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (acronym: ANOCA; French: Association des Comités Nationaux Olympiques d'Afrique, ACNOA, Arabic: رابطة اللجان الأولمبية الوطنية في إفريقيا) is an international organization that unites the 54 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of Africa. It is currently headquartered in Abuja, Nigeria. It serves as the successor to Standing Committee of African Sports or Comité permanent du sport africain founded in 1965 in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo.
It often assembles with other continental NOCs in the form of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC).


== History ==
The Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) was founded on June 28, 1981, in Lome, Togo. In July 1965, ANOCA's predecessor, the Standing Committee of African Sports (SCAS) was founded in Brazzaville as  Comité Permanent du Sport Africain (CPSA). Consequently, that title for the sports continental body changed to the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa (SCSA) on 14 December 1966 in Bamako, Mali.
On 4 March 2023, ANOCA announced their support for the International Olympic Committee's decision to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes as neutrals amidst the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, as well as the countries' participation in the Olympics.
