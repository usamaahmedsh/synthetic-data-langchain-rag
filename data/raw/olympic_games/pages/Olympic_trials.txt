Olympic trials are competitions held in certain sports to select teams' participants in those sports at the Olympic Games.


== History ==

Before 1908, members of United States Olympic teams were selected without trials. The 1908 and 1912 teams were selected based on regional trials, though the Eastern trials were favored. In the United States, no Olympic trials were held in 1916 due to World War I, nor in 1940 and 1944 due to World War II, though Olympic marathon team members were named in 1940.
