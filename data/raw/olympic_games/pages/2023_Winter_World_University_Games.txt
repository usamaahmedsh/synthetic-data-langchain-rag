The Lake Placid 2023 FISU World University Games, commonly known as Lake Placid 2023, was a collegiate multi-sport winter sports  held between January 12 to January 22, 2023 and had Lake Placid, New York, United States, as main host city. Alongside Lake Placid, events were also hosted by neighbouring cities of Wilmington, Saranac Lake, Potsdam and North Creek also located at the New York state.  The event is also known as the 31st Winter Universiade as administered by the International University Sports Federation (FISU). The event marks the return following the previous Universiade in Lucerne initially postponed from January to November 2021 and then cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
It marked the second edition of the Games, formerly known as the Winter Universiade, to be held in Lake Placid, after the 1972 games. It was the third time that the World University Games were held in the United States after Lake Placid in 1972 and 1993 Summer Universiade in Buffalo, also in the state of New York.


== Host selection and preparation ==
The FISU, led by director Milan Augustin, inspected the Lake Placid area in June 2017, as well as nearby town of Wilmington that was a support city for the activities of the Games. Lake Placid was officially announced as the host city on March 5, 2018; the bid was called one of the strongest in the history of Universiades by FISU officials.
As the 2021 Winter Universiade was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, the formal handover to Lake Placid was instead held at a ceremony in Turin in January 2022. A launch event was held at Lake Placid's Mid's Park on January 23, 2022.
The games were budgeted to cost $50 million, exclusive of Public Safety costs.


== Sports ==
The Games featured a record 85 medal events in 12 sports, which is highest number of the events held in a World World University Games edition in history, tying with Almaty 2017 which also had 85 events from 12 sports on its program. This edition had the current nine mandatory sports. Being the first in which freestyle skiing became a mandatory sport. By the current FISU rules, speed skating has a unique status within the FISU program, as it does not count as either a required or optional sport, and when a city adds it as an optional sport it gains the right to add an extra optional sport. In the case of Lake Placid, the choice was for the Nordic combined, as ski jumping was planned as an optional sport. This also the first time in Universiade history that women competed in the Nordic Combined.
