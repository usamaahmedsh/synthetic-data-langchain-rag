The Open  Constitution Initiative (OCI) (Chinese: 公盟; pinyin: gōngméng), sometimes referred to in English as Gongmeng, was an organization consisting of lawyers and academics in the People's Republic of China that advocated for the rule of law and greater constitutional protections. It was established by Peking University Law School scholars Xu Zhiyong, Teng Biao, Yu Jiang, and Zhang Xingshui in 2003, and was shut down by the Chinese government in 2009.


== Proposed Constitutional Amendments ==

In 2004, the group proposed amendment to include “human rights” in the Constitution, and petitioned it to the National People's Congress.


== Background ==
Since 2002, online independent media and tabloids have played an important role in political discourse within Chinese society. Many Chinese intellectuals have used the Internet to discuss the possible evolution of Chinese politics. The OCI is a group of such intellectuals whose website contained essays about constitutional issues and the protection of citizen's rights. One notable lawyer who is part of the group is Xu Zhiyong.


== Activities ==


=== 2003 ===
Xu Zhiyong, Teng Biao, and Yu Jiang raised the unconstitutionality of the investigation in the Sun Zhigang incident. In December, Xu was elected as a representative of the People's Congress of Haidian, Beijing.

On 8 June 2004, Chinese internet authorities shut down its web site without specifying a precise reason. The crackdown came during a time of heightened political tension regarding the Taiwan Straits and the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and also during events symbolic of China's increasing international interdependence, such as the visit of the Greek Olympian envoy.

The organization published a report criticising the Chinese government's policy towards Tibet, alleging that propaganda was being used to mask failings in its Tibet policy, such as ethnic inequality and creating "an aristocracy of corrupt and abusive government officials". It has been regarded as a more balanced view of the situation in Tibet and has had approval circulating through discussion websites in China, though the Chinese government has yet to comment. 


=== Closure ===
On July 14, 2009, the organization was fined 1.46 million RMB. On July 17, 2009, authorities declared the organization "illegal" and shut it down. On 29 July 2009, Xu Zhiyong was arrested on charges of 'tax evasion'. He was subsequently released on bail on 23 August 2009. On August 21, 2010, the public security bureau of Beijing dropped all the charges, returned all its items formerly held in custody, and released Xu from bail. Xu and others continued their works and activities with a new organization name Gongmin ("citizen(s)", Chinese: 公民; pinyin: gōngmín). However, his administrative assistant, Zhuang Lu, is reported to have disappeared, possibly held in a detention house in Beijing.
