Summerlin is a master-planned mixed-use development mostly within the city limits of Las Vegas, Nevada. The development covers 22,500 acres (91 km2) of the western edge of incorporated Las Vegas sitting at the center-west end of the Las Vegas Valley. Downtown Summerlin refers to the development's primary commercial and retail shopping area.
The neighborhood is adjacent to many wilderness conservation, recreation areas and commercial areas, including Red Rock and Spring Mountains and to the west, the La Madre and Mount Charleston Wilderness areas to its northwest, and the Las Vegas Strip resort corridor to its east.
The majority of Summerlin is within Las Vegas Ward I, currently represented on the Las Vegas City Council by Brian Knudsen, mayor pro tempore. Along with many private and charter schools, public education is provided by the Clark County School District. Emergency services are provided by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the Las Vegas Fire & Rescue department.


== History ==
In 1952, reclusive casino and film executive Howard Hughes purchased 30,000 acres (12,000 ha) of land along the western edge of the Las Vegas Valley for $3 per acre in an area valued at $1.27 million in 2022 USD, according to development company, Howard Hughes Holdings.
Despite initial intentions to reposition some of his business operations in Nevada, Hughes eventually chose not to relocate his core companies. Even though Hughes did not relocate operations, he became the largest single land owner in Nevada by the early 1970s and, for a time, the largest employer in the state with over 8,000 on his payroll. The land remained largely undeveloped for decades. In the mean time, the first large-scale master-planned community in Nevada, Green Valley in Henderson, began development 
After Hughes' death in 1976 from kidney failure, his heirs organized the Summa Corporation (now Howard Hughes Holdings), named for Hughes's paternal grandmother Jean Amelia Summerlin, to manage his businesses and land holdings.

In 1990, Summerlin Parkway, a six-lane highway costing $22 million to complete, running from Rainbow Boulevard to Town Center Drive, connecting the U.S. Route 95 to the new development.
To mitigate environmental impact, Summa Corporation made a deal with the Bureau of Land Management in which they traded 5,000 acres of environmentally sensitive land for 3,000 acres of land better suited for development. After this environmental concern was addressed, development began. By the end of 1990, the construction of its first residential area, park, and school had been completed. In 1994, Summa Corporation rebranded itself as the Howard Hughes Corporation and continued to develop new areas of Summerlin.
The Great Recession led to a temporary slowdown in new construction within Summerlin. However, development activity increased significantly after 2014, highlighted by the opening of Downtown Summerlin, a 106-acre development featuring retail stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues.
