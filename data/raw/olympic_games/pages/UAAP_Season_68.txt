== Suspension of De La Salle University-Manila ==
Controversy surrounded the UAAP after De La Salle University-Manila (DLSU) discovered that two members of its men's basketball team were ineligible to play in the UAAP from the 2003–2004 up to the 2005–2006 season. The players failed Department of Education's Philippine Educational Placement Test Certificate of Rating (PEPTCR, a replacement for a high school diploma). The University has offered to return the 2004 championship and 2005 runner-up trophy and file a leave of absence from the league.
In its meeting on April 21, 2006 in Adamson University, members of the UAAP Board unanimously decided to suspend DLSU in all sports events of the UAAP for the entire 2006–2007 season as a consequence of the university's negligence and inaction against the two ineligible players.
The board has also forfeited all of La Salle's men's basketball games from 2003 to 2004. The board awarded the 2004 title to FEU as a result.
If the forfeited games are factored in, the final elimination round standings is:

All of La Salle's victories in the playoffs were also forfeited; if La Salle won the 2005 title, they would've surrendered back the trophy to the finals opponents, FEU.
