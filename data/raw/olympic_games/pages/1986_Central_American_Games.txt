The III Central American Games (Spanish: III Juegos Deportivos Centroamericanos) was a multi-sport event that took place between 4–10 January 1986.  
Initially, the Games were scheduled for 1981 in Managua, Nicaragua, but were
cancelled due to the unstable political situation.
The Games were called the "Peace Games" (Spanish: Juegos de la Paz).
  The official song was the "Hymn of the Peace Games" (Spanish: Himno de los Juegos de la Paz) composed by Alfonso Agulló.
Long-distance runner Mateo Flores was honoured to light the torch in the stadium bearing his name.
