His father appointed him and Bahar as directors of the New York Palace before to the couple's departure for Brunei. The large, hefty princes are the real heirs to Jefri's lavish lifestyle, claim Jefri's lawyers Faith Zaman and Thomas Derbyshire. At one of Hakeem's birthdays, Rod Stewart gave a performance. At a cost of seven figures apiece, his father brought in NFL players Joe Montana and Herschel Walker to Brunei to instruct him in the game when he expressed a desire to learn football. No one was permitted to tackle him, so when Hakeem couldn't catch the ball, a teammate would pass it to him, and he would slide down the field for an easy score. According to one of Zaman's statements, his father gave him $1 billion as a birthday present when he turned 18.
