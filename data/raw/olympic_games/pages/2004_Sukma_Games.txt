The 2004 Sukma Games, officially known as the 10th Sukma Games, was a Malaysian multi-sport event held in Negeri Sembilan from May 29 to June 6, 2004. Sarawakian swimmer Daniel Bego and Perakian swimmer Cindy Ong were announced as the Best Sportsman and Best Sportswoman of the event, respectively.


== Development and preparation ==
The 10th Sukma Games Organizing Committee was formed to oversee the staging of the event. According to the Menteri Besar of Negeri Sembilan, Dato' Seri Utama Haji Mohamad bin Haji Hasan, the state government spent around RM170 million to organize the event. Around RM132.6 million out of that  amount was allocated for the renovation and upgrading of the stadium and facilities. The actual cost of organizing the sports event was around RM36 million.
Major construction took place, especially in the hub of the sports complex in Paroi, such as the renovation of Tuanku Abdul Rahman Stadium and the construction of the new aquatic complex, which began in 2002. There was a major upgrade for the state hockey stadium and Tan Sri Dr. Mohamed Said bowling complex in Seremban 2.


=== Venues ===
The 2004 Sukma Games used a mix of new and existing venues. Most venues were existing public-sporting facilities, while others were newly constructed venues. Some retrofitting work was done in venues that are more than a decade old. They will be returned to public use after the games.
The centerpiece of the activities was the upgraded 45,000-seat Tuanku Abdul Rahman Stadium, which hosts most of the events. A games village was not built; instead, athletes and officials were housed in universities, apartments, and hotels throughout Negeri Sembilan.
Besides being physically near the sports venues, it was hoped that it would add vibe to the city and reduce post-game costs by converting a dedicated games village to other uses.
The 10th Sukma Games had 31 venues for the games. 22 in Seremban, four in Port Dickson, three in Kuala Pilah and two in Rembau.

=== Logo ===

The logo of the 2004 Sukma Games is a geometrically shaped image. Three geometrical objects resembling the three athletes standing together to hold the torch up represent the unity of Malaysia through sports, which is concurrent with the Sukma Games objective, which is to improve unity and integration of nationality among the various communities in Malaysia. The three athletes also represent the champion, runner-up, and second runner-up positions, which is the goal of every athlete.
The torch signifies the strength and competitive spirit of the athlete to achieve victory in every event. The four color's used in the game's logo are red, which represents the strength and spirit needed to achieve victory; yellow, which represents sovereign rights and harmony in Negeri Sembilan; blue, which represents unity and national integration; and black, which represents the traditional rule of Negeri Sembilan State under the Adat Perpatih norm.


=== Mascot ===
The mascot of the 2004 Sukma Games is a nameless deer. It was a 'royalty hunt' in the glory days of the Malay Sultanate of Malacca and is now a symbol of Negeri Sembilan and one of the prevalent species in Malaysia. The mascot's adoption is meant to promote the state's eco-tourism.
