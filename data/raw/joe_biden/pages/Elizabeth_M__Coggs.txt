== Background ==

Elizabeth Monette Coggs was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Coggs is a lifelong Milwaukee resident.

Her mother, Marcia Priscilla Young Coggs, was the first African-American woman elected to Wisconsin State Assembly (in 1976). Elizabeth graduated from Lincoln High School, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in African-American studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.


== Politics ==


=== Milwaukee County Board ===
She was first elected a county supervisor in 1988, being re-elected from 1992 to 2008. As of 2010 she was the longest-serving member of the County Board.


=== State Assembly ===
In 2010 she defeated two other candidates, Stephanie Findley and Sherman Hill to win the primary election for the State Assembly, in the 10th District after Annette Polly Williams announced that she was not running for election.
Her only opponent was independent Ieshuh Griffin, who attracted national attention (including an appearance on The Daily Show) for eventually unsuccessful efforts to label herself as "NOT the 'whiteman's bitch'" (utilizing a state rule that allows independent candidates to use a five-word statement of purpose on the ballot to categorize themselves) on the election ballot. Coggs received 15,874 votes; Griffin 1223.

Committee assignments
2011-2012
In the 2011-2012 legislative session, Coggs served on these committees:

Aging and Long-Term Care Committee
Consumer Protection Committee
Urban and Local Affairs Committee


=== State Senate ===
In 2012, instead of running for re-election to the Assembly, she chose to run for the vacant Sixth Senate district, previously held by her cousin Spencer Coggs. Her July 2012 call to the mostly-black voters at an inner-city candidate forum to "vote for someone who looks like you" led to accusations that she was attacking Assemblywoman Sandy Pasch, the only white candidate in the race to replace Coggs in her 10th Assembly district seat (Pasch's current seat was eliminated by the Republican-led legislature during the most recent redistricting, and she had moved into the new 10th district). All her opponents were African-American, but several African-American candidates at the forum decried Coggs' remarks as racist. None of Pasch's opponents had held elected office. "I don't think anyone should vote for anyone on account of their skin color", opponent Ieshuh Griffin said of Coggs' remarks. "It's not about color."
Coggs' predecessor, Polly Williams, describing Pasch as "a White suburban woman" who "can't win in her own district", expressed concern that inner-city seats such as hers could be lost to white Democrats due to alleged machinations by "non-Black forces from outside the community". She lost the Democratic primary (tantamount to election in this inner-city seat) to County Supervisor Nikiya Harris. The 10th district Democratic nomination was taken by Pasch, with over 60% of the vote.


== Personal life ==
Elizabeth Coggs was married to Wendell Jones (they divorced in 2008), and is the mother of Priscilla, Chloé and Devona. She belongs to the Church of God in Christ. Another cousin, Leon Young, was a state legislator.
