Amie "Breeze" Harper is an American critical race feminist, diversity strategist, and author of books and studies on veganism and racism. Her Sistah Vegan anthology features a collection of writings by black female vegans.


== Life and career ==
Harper attributes her initial interest in practicing veganism to the influence of the work of Dick Gregory in connecting diet to the liberation struggle of marginalized groups, and to Afrocentric, raw foodist Queen Afua.
In 2015, Harper organized a conference, The Vegan Praxis of Black Lives Matters, to discuss intersectional issues concerning veganism and the Black Lives Matter movement. In the same year, Harper joined the advisory board for Black Vegans Rock.
Harper was the Humane Party's vice-presidential nominee for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
