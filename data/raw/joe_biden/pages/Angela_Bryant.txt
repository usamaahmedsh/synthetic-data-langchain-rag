In 2013, she was selected by a committee of local Democrats and then appointed by Governor Pat McCrory (who was required to accept the local committee's selection), to fill the seat of state Sen.

She represented District 4 in the North Carolina Senate (including constituents in Halifax, Nash, Vance, Warren, and Wilson counties).
