East Granby is a town in the Capitol Planning Region, Connecticut, United States. The population was 5,214 at the 2020 census.


== History ==
Original inhabitants of the current East Granby area were Native American peoples, including the Algonquin/Poquonock, the Massaco, and the Agawam.
The East Granby area was first settled by Europeans in 1664, which was one of the four Congregational parishes in Simsbury. The Turkey Hills Ecclesiastical Society in 1786 became a section of Granby, and in 1858 was incorporated as the Town of East Granby.
The first incorporated copper mine in America resided in what is now East Granby. The mine later became Old Newgate Prison, a Revolutionary War jail and the first state prison in the United States (1790).
Farming was the mainstay of the town for much of its history.  The early twentieth century saw local farmers specializing in dairy product and tobacco.
East Granby experienced a housing boom that started in 1951 and resulted in a rise in population.
The town celebrated its 150th anniversary with a three-day festival June 7–9, 2008.

High points on the Metacomet Ridge in East Granby include Hatchet Hill and Peak Mountain; the latter offers a bird's eye view of the historic Old Newgate Prison. The 51-mile (82 km) Metacomet Trail traverses the ridge.
