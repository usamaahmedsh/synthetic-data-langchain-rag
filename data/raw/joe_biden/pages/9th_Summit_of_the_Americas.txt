The Ninth Summit of the Americas was an international conference held in Los Angeles, United States, from June 6 to 10, 2022. The theme was "Building a Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Future".


== Background ==
The White House announced in January 2022 that the City of Los Angeles would serve as host. As host, the United States selects the site of the summit and its attendees. The United States did not invite Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua to the summit as these countries are accused of having undemocratically elected leaders. It was known the US would not invite these leaders. The White House and State Department did not announce an official invitation list until May 30.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the President of Mexico, was the first to announce he would not attend the summit if all nations were not in attendance. López Obrador stated he would send his foreign secretary to the summit in his place. Other leaders followed, such as Xiomara Castro, the President of Honduras; Luis Arce, the President of Bolivia; Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador; and Ralph Gonsalves, the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.  Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said they would not attend the summit if invited.
The United States Department of State led efforts to galvanize support for the summit and keep other nations from not attending. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian A. Nichols stated the US will not invite countries that do not respect democracy.
Alejandro Giammattei, the President of Guatemala, stated he would not attend the summit after the US criticized his government's reappointment of María Consuelo Porras as attorney general, who had been accused of undermining corruption investigations. Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou had been scheduled to attend, but cancelled after testing positive for COVID-19. Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell announced he would not attend due to the current election cycle in his country. Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Bolivia, Uruguay, Grenada, and Saint Kitts and Nevis sent a delegation headed by their respective secretaries or ambassadors. Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had no government delegation at the summit.
