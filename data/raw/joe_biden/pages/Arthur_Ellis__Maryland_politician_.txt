Arthur Carr Ellis (born July 26, 1961) is an American politician and accountant who has served as a member of the Maryland Senate from the 28th district since 2019.


== Background ==
Ellis was born in Portland Parish, Jamaica, on July 26, 1961. He graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry and agriculture in 1983, and the City University of New York (CUNY) with a Master of Science in accountancy in 1990. He served in the United States Air Force from 1983 to 1989, and in the U.S. Air Force Reserves until 2001, attaining the rank of second lieutenant. He returned to the United States and moved to Maryland after being discharged from the military after being injured while serving.
After graduating from CUNY, Ellis became an associate at Mitchell & Titus, and afterwards worked as an instructor for the Maryland Association of Certified Public Accountants, the University of the District of Columbia, and the University of Maryland Global Campus until 1993. From 2008 to 2017, he worked as a volunteer leader at the University of Maryland Extension.

Ellis became involved in politics as a member of the Charles County NAACP chapter, becoming its communications director in 2016. In March 2017, he criticized the state's $900,000 purchase and preservation of land where Josiah Henson was enslaved before escaping to freedom, arguing that the money would be better spent on youth programs. He ran for the Maryland Senate in 2018, challenging six-term incumbent Thomas M. Middleton. Ellis defeated Middleton in an upset in the Democratic primary on June 26, 2018, receiving 52.0 percent of the vote and edging out Middleton by 651 votes. Following Middleton's defeat, the Maryland Republican Party targeted the district, backing businessman and Charles County Republican Party chairman Bill Dotson, who Ellis defeated in the general election on November 6, 2018, with 66.2 percent of the vote.

=== Education ===
During the 2020 legislative session, Ellis voted against an amendment to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future that would provide $150 million in grants toward programs to improve students' behavioral health, arguing that it could "stigmatize poor kids and create a long-lasting trail of unemployability for these children". In January 2021, he said he supported overriding Governor Larry Hogan's veto of the Blueprint.
During the 2022 legislative session, Ellis introduced a bill that would split up the College of Southern Maryland and use the college's La Plata campus to create a new Charles County Community College.

During the 2021 legislative session, Ellis introduced a bill to require the makeup of local election boards to be based on the party affiliation of voters in each county, rather than the governor's political party. He also supported a bill that would eliminate at-large county commissioner districts, requiring commissioners to be elected to individual districts.
In November 2025, Ellis said he would support a bill to redraw Maryland's congressional districts to make Maryland's 1st congressional district more favorable for Democrats in response to Republican mid-decade redistricting efforts in various red states.


=== Environment ===
During the 2021 legislative session, Ellis introduced an amendment to the Climate Solutions Now Act that would prioritize tree planting projects in underserved areas, and another amendment requiring the state's climate transition workgroup to include a veteran, a formerly incarcerated person, two women and two NAACP members; both amendments were adopted.


=== Policing ===
During the 2021 legislative session, Ellis introduced a bill that would prohibit school resource officers from entering schools unless instructed or in the event of an emergency. The bill failed to move out of committee.
