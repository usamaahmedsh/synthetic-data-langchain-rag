== Career ==


=== Academic ===


==== University of Ottawa ====
In 1989, Panchanathan joined the University of Ottawa as assistant professor and in 1994 was promoted to associate professor.


==== Arizona State University ====
In 1997, Panchanathan joined ASU in Tempe, Arizona as a tenured associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. In 2001, he was promoted to full professor and founded the Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing (CUbiC) and became an IEEE fellow for his contributions to compressed domain processing and indexing in visual computing and communications. He also founded and led the School of Computing and Informatics (2006-2009) and the Department of Biomedical Informatics (2005-2007).
Panchanathan was appointed ASU's chief research officer in 2009, and in 2011, was promoted to senior vice president of ASU's Office of Knowledge Enterprise Development.
In 2016, Panchanathan became executive vice president of ASU Knowledge Enterprise Development and chief research and innovation officer. He served in this role until his nomination as Director of the National Science Foundation in 2020.


=== U.S. National Science Foundation ===
On June 13, 2014, President Barack Obama nominated Panchanathan to the National Science Board of the National Science Foundation (NSF).
On December 19, 2019, President Donald Trump nominated Panchanathan as Director of the National Science Foundation; the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on June 18, 2020 and he assumed office on June 23, 2020.
In 2022, Panchanathan announced the formation of the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), the first new directorate formed by the NSF in more than 30 years. Other notable achievements during his tenure include a new GRANTED program to broaden participation in research and education, the establishment of a network of 27 National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes, the creation of the Global Centers Program to support "large-scale use-inspired research in collaboration with international partners to address global challenges that cannot be solved by any single country," and the launch of the Regional Innovation Engines program to expand the geography of place-based innovation
He resigned as director on April 24, 2025, stating, "I believe I have done all I can to advance the critical mission of the agency and feel that it is time for me to pass the baton to new leadership."


== Controversies ==


=== Arizona State University Lawsuit ===
In February 2021, Dr. Cynthia Sagers, a professor and former Vice President for Research at ASU's Knowledge Enterprise, filed a lawsuit against ASU and Panchanathan, alleging that Panchanathan demoted Sagers after she raised concerns about his behavior. ASU conducted an internal investigation into the allegations and concluded that the claims were unsubstantiated; the university proceeded with the demotion, effective December 1, 2020. The lawsuit was later terminated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona by a granted motion for summary judgement.


=== U.S. National Science Foundation ===
On February 4, 2025, 168 NSF workers, representing approximately 10% of the workforce, were fired as part of mass layoffs in the U.S. federal workforce. Panchanathan's absence from the firing meetings was criticized by other NSF employees.


== Research ==

Panchanathan's research interests include Human-centered Multimedia Computing (HCMC), assistive and rehabilitative technologies, haptic user interfaces, face/gait analysis and recognition, medical image processing, media processor designs and ubiquitous computing environments for enhancing quality of life for individuals with disabilities. He has mentored over 100 students and scholars, including graduate students, post-docs, research engineers and research scientists. He spoke on the importance of fostering a culture of innovation to solve grand challenges that society faces today in a 2017 TEDxASU presentation.


== Personal life ==
Panchanathan is married to Sarada "Soumya" Panchanathan. They have two children and three grandchildren.
