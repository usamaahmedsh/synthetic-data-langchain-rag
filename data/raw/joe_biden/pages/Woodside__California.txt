Woodside is an incorporated town in San Mateo County, California, United States, on the San Francisco Peninsula. It has a council–manager system of government.
The population of the town was 5,309 at the 2020 census. The town's population has a median household income above $250,000 and median home price above $5 million. The town is known for its quaint and small town feel despite being close to Silicon Valley, and is home to many venture capital and investment firms.


== History ==
The Woodside area was originally home to the Ohlone tribe. In 1769, led by Gaspar de Portolá, Spanish explorers searching for San Francisco Bay camped at a site near Woodside. In 1840, the land that was to be the future Woodside became part of a Mexican land grant, Rancho Cañada de Raymundo, which in 1841 was granted to an Englishman, John Coppinger.
Woodside is said to be the oldest English-speaking settlement in the southern part of the San Francisco Peninsula. The first English-speaking settlers arrived in the early 19th century to log the rich stands of redwoods. Charles Brown constructed the first sawmill in Woodside on his Mountain Home Ranch around 1847. Brown's adobe house still stands today. By mid-century, the Woodside area had a dozen mills producing building materials for a booming San Francisco.
In 1849, during the California Gold Rush, 20-year-old Mathias Alfred Parkhurst purchased 127 acres (0.5 km2) of timberland and named it "Woodside". By the late 19th century, Woodside was home to country estates. The Sequoia Redwood trees in Woodside are currently 3rd generation growth; the first generation of which were used to build San Francisco's original homes. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the loggers returned to Woodside to cut the second growth of redwood so it could be used for the rebuilding of San Francisco.
In 1909, the Family, a private club in San Francisco, set up camp facilities and rustic buildings in Woodside at the Family Farm, a rural retreat used by club members for recreation. Gatherings at the Family Farm include an annual Farm Play, written and performed by members. In 1912, the Family pooled funds to build Our Lady of the Wayside Church in Portola Valley, designed by 19-year-old Timothy L. Pflueger, his first commission. The historic building was repaired at a cost of $600,000 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Woodside was incorporated in 1956 and it retains a rural residential character even though it is only a short commute to Silicon Valley and Stanford University.
In early 2022, the town initially declared itself a mountain lion habitat to circumvent state affordable housing requirements and then subsequently retracted that position. It backed down after California Attorney General Rob Bonta denied this claim writing, "[t]here is no valid basis to claim that the entire town of Woodside is a habitat for mountain lions."

On November 15, 2023, a meeting was held at the Filoli estate in Unincorporated San Mateo County near the town of Woodside, between President Biden and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping amid the 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit taking place in San Francisco. After meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping that day, Biden announced the two made progress on a common understanding to crack down on chemicals trafficked from China that are used to make fentanyl, improve military communications in the Indo-Pacific, and address risks associated with artificial intelligence.


== Geography ==
Woodside is located on the San Francisco Peninsula in San Mateo County. The town is on the eastern slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains and its south-western boundary reaches California State Route 35 which runs along the ridge of those mountains. Redwood City to the north with Atherton and Menlo Park to the east lie between Woodside and the San Francisco Bay. To the south is Portola Valley.
Much of Woodside is wooded, with redwoods and Douglas fir dominating in the western hills and more oaks and eucalyptus in the lower areas. West Union Creek joins Bear Creek in Woodside. Woodside has a variety of habitat types including California oak woodland and riparian zones. There is considerable biodiversity present, Woodside being within the California Floristic Province. Notable species present include the rare and endangered species Acanthomintha duttonii, the San Mateo Thornmint. The San Andreas Fault runs through portions of Woodside.
