In the 2018 elections, Torres Small ran as a Democrat for the open United States House of Representatives seat in New Mexico's 2nd congressional district. The Republican incumbent, Steve Pearce, declined to run for reelection in order to run for governor of New Mexico. Torres Small defeated Madeline Hildebrandt in the Democratic Party primary election and Republican state Representative Yvette Herrell in the general election. She ran as a moderate Democrat.
The results were close on election night, with Herrell in the lead at the end of the night; some New Mexico media organizations projected that she would win. The next day, more ballots were counted, narrowing Herrell's lead, and media organizations rescinded their projections. On November 7, after all absentee ballots were counted, the New Mexico Secretary of State declared Torres Small the winner.
