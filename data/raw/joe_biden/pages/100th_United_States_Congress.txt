The 100th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 1987, to January 3, 1989, during the last two years of Ronald Reagan's presidency. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the 1980 United States census.
This is the most recent Congress with a Democratic senator from the state of Mississippi, John C. Stennis, who retired at the end of Congress, and a Republican senator from the state of Connecticut, Lowell Weicker, who lost re-election in 1988.
Both chambers had a Democratic majority, with the Democrats increasing their lead in the House, and regaining the Senate for the first time since the 96th Congress from 1979 to 1981.
