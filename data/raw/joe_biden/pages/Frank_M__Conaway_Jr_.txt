Frank Melvin Conaway Jr. (born January 4, 1963) is an American politician who serves as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing the 40th district.


== Early life and education ==
Conaway was born in Baltimore to Frank M. Conaway Sr., who was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates and later as the clerk of the Baltimore City Circuit Court, and Mary Conaway, who served as the Baltimore Register of Wills. He attended Northwestern High School and later attended Howard University and Morgan State University from 1980 to 1984, and graduated from Sojourner–Douglass College in 1999 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration.


== Career ==
After attending Morgan State, Conaway worked for construction firms Monumental Paint Contractors and Allied Bendix Corporation until 1986, when he started his own company, Frank M. Conaway Jr. & Associates Co., and replica kit-car business F-Dreams, Inc., which Conaway says was bankrupted by the North American Free Trade Agreement. Afterwards, he worked as a sales representative for various companies, including Olan Mills, from 1989 to 2005.
In 1992, Conaway and his father accused Olan Mills of firing them after Conaway Sr. caught the company using a secret racial code to alert employees when they were scheduled to work at Black churches, which the company used to steer the Conaways away from more lucrative white parishes. Olan Mills defended their use of racial codes as a "sales tool so that employees can take in the proper portrait samples for the community we're serving as customers". Following his firing, Conaway Jr. filed a discrimination complaint with the company.
Conaway is the author of the book Baptist Gnostic Christian Eubonic Kundalinion Spiritual Ki Do Hermeneutic Metaphysics: The Word: Hermeneutics and The 20 Pennies a Day Diet Plan.


== Political career ==
In 1999, Conaway unsuccessfully ran for President of the Baltimore City Council, losing to Sheila Dixon in the Democratic primary.
In 2006, Conaway successfully ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in District 40. He was sworn in on January 10, 2007, and has been a member of the Judiciary Committee during his entire tenure.

Conaway was married to his wife, Latesa Elaine Thomas, and had three children—Frank III, Kelly, and Lacynda—prior to their divorce in 2006. In 2003, Thomas obtained a domestic violence protective order against Conaway, stating in court documents that he had "threatened to kill" her and had "pushed her face through a back door window".
According to court documents obtained by the Baltimore City Paper, Conaway has bipolar disorder, for which he has been taking medication.


=== YouTube videos ===
In late October 2014, Conaway received significant attention after he uploaded more than 50 videos to YouTube. In the videos, which were characterised as "rambling" and "bizarre", he talked about cryptograms in Ancient Egyptian carvings, the Book of Revelation, talking horses, Rubik's Cube, Sasquatch and Yeti. He also wondered if he was a hologram, referred to himself as "meta", advocated his weight loss book The 20 Pennies a Day Diet Plan by talking about canned chicken, Arizona Diet Green Tea and sugar free hard candies and promoted his other books, Trapezium Giza Pyramid Artificial Black Hole Theory, Baptist Gnostic Christian Eubonic Kundalinion Spiritual Ki Do Hermeneutic Metaphysics: The Word: Hermeneutics and Christian Kundalini Science- Proof of the Soul- Cryptogram Solution of Egyptian Stela 55001- & Opening the Hood of Ra.
In a phone interview with The Baltimore Sun, Conaway claimed to have deciphered artwork at the Walters Art Museum and said that it was "part of my duties as a Christian" to try and "spread the knowledge that I have". He also talked about Moses, Egyptian Obelisks, the "Frankenfish", the Fibonacci number and faces on Mars and said that he did not "believe" in evolution, arguing that "Darwin [said] that we descended from monkeys... I haven't seen any evidence to say man came from a monkey."
The videos appeared to have been filmed in the Baltimore City Hall mail room, where he had also worked since being hired as a clerk at the Municipal Post Office by Comptroller Joan Pratt in 2006. In November 2014, he resigned from his City Hall job and took down the videos. They have been preserved by web developer Chris Cook.
Despite widespread mockery and a general election write-in campaign from State Delegate Shawn Z. Tarrant, who had finished fourth in the Democratic primary for the three-seat district (there were no Republican candidates for the district), Conaway was re-elected in the 2014 elections.
