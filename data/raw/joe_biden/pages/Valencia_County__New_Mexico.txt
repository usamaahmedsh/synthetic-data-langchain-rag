== Politics ==
Valencia County once held the longest active streak of voting for the winner of U.S. presidential elections, breaking for the nationwide winner in every presidential election from 1952 to 2016. In 2020, both it and Vigo County, Indiana broke their streaks dating back to the 1950s (since 1956 in Vigo) by selecting Donald Trump over eventual winner Joe Biden, then leaving Clallam County, Washington, whose streak extends back to 1980 (but would later have its own streak broken, when it backed the losing candidate in Kamala Harris over Trump in 2024), as the holder of longest-running presidential bellwether.  Before 1952, its record is less reliable; the only other Democratic president it voted for was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. The county has seen a steady Republican trend in recent elections, with Donald Trump's 2024 performance being the best by a Republican presidential candidate since 1984.
