== Political career ==
Jones' first position in elective office was as Calumet City's 3rd ward alderman from 1997 to 2007. His first year in state office began in 2011, after beating primary opponent Sheryl Tillman for the 29th district seat by 24 points, and Green Party candidate Kenny Williams by 66 points in the 2010 Illinois General election.
In 2017, Jones resigned from his role with his eponymous Jones Foundation for using charitable donations for campaign finance purposes.
In 2021, Jones become the first Black mayor of Calumet City, after beating 18-year incumbent mayor Michelle Markiewicz Qualkinbush. The election was fiercely-contested, with both sides alleging foul play against each other. The Qualkinbush team accused Jones of falsifying his residency to meet eligibility requirements, while the Jones campaign cited their opponents' lack of reporting on an estimated $80,000 in public funds spent on mailers calling for his ballot ineligibility. Jones' victory and inauguration were subject to judicial challenge which initially overturned the results, but this judgment was eventually appealed and affirmed in the Supreme Court of Illinois. Jones beat a write-in candidate Tony Quiroz on April 6, and will simultaneously hold the 29th district Illinois statehouse seat while acting as Calumet City mayor. He was sworn in May 1, 2021.
