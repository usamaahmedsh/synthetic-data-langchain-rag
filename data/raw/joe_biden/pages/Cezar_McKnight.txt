Cezar E. McKnight is an American politician. He is a former member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from the 101st District, serving since 2014. He is a member of the Democratic party.
In January 2022, McKnight made headlines after he introduced a bill named after George Stinney, a 14-year old black boy who was wrongfully executed in 1944, titled the George Stinney Fund, which would make the state of South Carolina pay $10 million to the families of the wrongfully executed if their conviction is posthumously overturned.
McKnight was defeated in the 2022 June Democratic Primary by Democrat Roger K. Kirby.
