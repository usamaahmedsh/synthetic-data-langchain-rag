== Political career ==

Clay was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1968. Along with fellow African American lawmakers such as former Reps. Shirley Chisholm (D-NY) and Louis Stokes (D-OH), Clay was one of three newcomer members of Congress in 1969 who helped co-found of the Black Congressional Caucus predecessor group the "Democratic Select Committee" at behest of Charles Diggs (D-MI). During a meeting between caucus members on February 2, 1971, Clay would help lay for the foundation for the creation of the Congressional Black Caucus when he proposed transforming the Democratic Select Committee into a formal nonpartisan caucus for African American U.S. Congress members. He became an advocate for environmentalism, labor issues, and social justice. Clay voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. From 1991 until the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1995, Clay chaired the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service. In 2000, he announced his retirement from the House, and his son, Lacy, succeeded him.
