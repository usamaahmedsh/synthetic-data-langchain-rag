=== 2023 special election ===

Amo left his White House job to run in the 2023 special election for Rhode Island's 1st congressional district, after incumbent representative David Cicilline announced his resignation from Congress to run the non-profit Rhode Island Foundation. Amo's campaign focused on protecting Social Security, Medicare, and abortion rights, while tackling gun violence and climate change. He received endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus, former Rhode Island representative Patrick J. Kennedy, and former White House chief of staff Ron Klain. He also was supported by outside spending from Democrats Serve PAC and Collective PAC.
Amo was criticized for accepting over $20,000 from federal lobbyists representing major corporations, including Fox Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, Philip Morris USA, Marathon Petroleum, and others. His receipts also included more than $8,000 from lobbyists for Wall Street firms and banks, such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, and Bitcoin. His primary campaign received more than $600,000 in donations in total. In late August, a poll conducted for his campaign showed him in second place.
In September 2023, in an upset, Amo won the Democratic primary to become the party's nominee for Rhode Island's 1st congressional district. The general election was held on November 7. Amo won the election, becoming the first person of color elected to represent Rhode Island in Congress. He was officially sworn into Congress on November 13, 2023.
