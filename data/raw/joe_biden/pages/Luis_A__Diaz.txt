Diaz was a faculty member in the Department of Oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He was also a member of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Genetics and Therapeutics at Johns Hopkins, where he worked with colleagues Bert Vogelstein, Kenneth Kinzler, Nickolas Papadopoulos, Victor Velculescu and Shibin Zhou. He was also head of the Swim Across America Laboratory at Johns Hopkins.
In 2017, Diaz became Head of the Solid Tumor Oncology division at Memorial Sloan Kettering. The same year, he was selected to lead the Stand Up to Cancer “Dream Team” against colorectal cancer.

== Research ==
Diaz researched the development of a liquid biopsy that can be used to test for the presence of cancer and to monitor its response to therapy. Also while at Hopkins, he and his colleagues developed a Pap smear to detect early-stage ovarian and endometrial cancers. He also led a study of pembrolizumab to target tumors that share a particular biomarker called mismatch repair deficiency. It was the first FDA approval for a cancer treatment based on a biomarker rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated.
