== 2019 aldermanic campaign ==
Matt Martin's campaign emphasized funding public schools, maintaining affordability in the ward, property tax relief for homeowners, and police accountability. He was endorsed by the Chicago Tribune which noted that Martin "has an independent streak and shares our determination that a new City Council put away its rubber stamp and flex its legislative muscle. We believe Martin can be an influential new voice on a re-energized council." In addition, he was endorsed by former Cook County Clerk David Orr and organizations such as ONE People's Campaign and United Working Families.
He finished first with 39.4% in a nine-candidate field in the election held on February 26, 2019 and then faced Michael Negron, who finished in second place with 21.4%, in a runoff election held on April 2, 2019.

On April 2, 2019, he won the runoff election with 62.6% of the vote.
On April 10, 2019, Martin joined six other newly elected members of the Chicago City Council in protesting against the approval of tax increment financing for the Lincoln Yards and The 78 real estate developments.

=== City-wide issues ===


==== City budget ====
Martin was one of 11 aldermen who voted against Mayor Lori Lightfoot's proposed 2020 budget, alongside other members of the Progressive Caucus. In a statement, Martin said "While I commend the Mayor and her budget team for filling this year’s budget gap without layoffs or a significant property tax increase, ultimately, I saw a number of critical missed opportunities to seek more progressive sources of revenue, fund our social services in a more robust manner, and pursue structural changes that will set us on the path to solvency." Martin held multiple public events and town hall meetings about the budget before and after the vote.


=== Alliances and relationships ===
At the start of the 2019–23 term, Martin joined City Council's Progressive Caucus and Black Caucus.
