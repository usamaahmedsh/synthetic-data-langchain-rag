As part of the Solid South, Florence County was strongly Democratic throughout its early existence. In recent years, though, Florence has shifted to a Republican-leaning county, having not voted Democratic at the presidential level since Jimmy Carter in 1976. However, it has done so by relatively modest margins, as the county has been decided by a single-digit margin in every election since 2008. In 2020, incumbent Republican president Donald Trump narrowly carried Florence County, winning 32,615 votes (50.56%) to 31,153 (48.29%) for Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Typically, Democratic strength is concentrated in the City of Florence, while the suburban and rural areas lean strongly Republican.
Most of the county is located within the state's 7th congressional district, which is represented by Republican Russell Fry. A small portion of the county, specifically the areas around Lake City, is located in the majority-minority 6th district, and is represented by Democrat Jim Clyburn.
