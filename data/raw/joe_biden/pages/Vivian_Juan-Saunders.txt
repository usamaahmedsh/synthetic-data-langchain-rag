In 1999, Juan-Saunders, together with running mate Ned Norris, Jr., challenged incumbent Tohono O'odham Chairman Edward D. Manuel for the chairmanship in the executive election. Manuel defeated Juan-Saunders to win a second term in office.
Juan-Saunders once again challenged Manuel in 2003, in a rematch of the 1999 race. She  was elected the Chairwoman of the Tohono O'odham nation in the May 24. 2003, tribal election, with Ned Norris, Jr. as her running mate. She defeated incumbent Tohono O'odham Chairman Edward D. Manuel, who had held the office since 1995, with 59% of the popular vote while carrying eight of the eleven electoral districts.  In doing so, she became the first woman to lead the Tohono O'odham.
