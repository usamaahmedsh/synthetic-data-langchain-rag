In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Greenwood County was established, and named for Alfred B. Greenwood, a U.S. Congressman from Arkansas.
The first railroad in Greenwood County was built through that territory in 1879.
