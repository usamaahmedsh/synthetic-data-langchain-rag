The foreign relations of Romania is the policy arm of the government of Romania which guides its interactions with other nations, their citizens, and foreign organizations, as well as its status as a member of the European Union (EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other key international organizations. Since the end of the Cold War and the 1989 Romanian Revolution, Romania has pursued a foreign policy centered on Euro-Atlantic integration, joining NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007. Prioritizing multilateralism, collective security, and democratic values, Romania maintains active diplomatic relations with neighboring states, including Ukraine, Moldova, Hungary, and Bulgaria, while fostering regional cooperation through initiatives such as the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) and the Three Seas Initiative. 
Romania is classified by scholars and international relations experts as a middle power, a designation reflecting its moderate but influential role in international relations and regional relations. Analysts highlight Romania's strategic geographic position, growing economic capacity, and active participation in multilateral institutions as key factors underpinning this status.
