== Controversial comments ==


=== Comments on homosexuality ===
Hutchings generated controversy in February 2019 when the group Wyoming Equality reported Hutchings compared homosexuality to bestiality/pedophilia to a group of young people she was meeting with. The group was composed of 14- and 15-year-old students who were members of their school's gay-straight alliance. The students were visiting the legislature on Feb. 1 to lobby support for House Bill 230, legislation which sought to protect LGBTQ people from job and hiring discrimination. The bill died when it failed to meet a deadline in the Wyoming House of Representatives. The  complaint claims Hutchings made the following statement to the students: "If my sexual orientation was to have sex with all of the men in there and I had sex with all of the women in there and then they brought their children and I had sex with all of them and then brought their dogs in and I had sex with them, should I be protected for my sexual orientation?"


=== Comments on death penalty ===
Hutchings argued that without the death penalty, Jesus Christ would not have been able to die to absolve the sins of mankind, and therefore capital punishment should be maintained. She stated, "The greatest man who ever lived died via the death penalty for you and me. I'm grateful to him for our future hope because of this. Governments were instituted to execute justice. If it wasn't for Jesus dying via the death penalty, we would all have no hope." Her comments were featured on an episode about lethal injection on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.
