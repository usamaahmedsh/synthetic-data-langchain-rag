== Controversy over 2025 Remarks on Asian Americans ==
In April 2025, during a California Assembly Higher Education Committee hearing on Assembly Bill 7 (AB 7), Assemblymember Jackson made remarks that drew criticism from Asian American advocacy groups and civil rights commentators. Addressing Bruce Lou, a Chinese American activist opposed to the bill, Jackson stated: “Some people who have come to this country in different ways unfortunately believe that they’re on the same standing as us.”
The comment was criticized by Asian American organizations and members of the public as racially divisive, with many interpreting it as questioning the equal civic standing of Asian Americans. Bruce Lou, the target of the remark, described it as “racist” and “divisive,” while others noted that the statement echoed exclusionary rhetoric historically used to marginalize Asian Americans.
As of May 2025, Jackson has not issued a public clarification or apology. The incident prompted discussions on racial dynamics, coalition-building among minority communities, and the scope of historical redress in education policy.
