John M. Lewellen (September 16, 1930 – November 25, 2017) was an American politician who served on the Little Rock City board of directors, the Pulaski County Quorum Court, and in the Arkansas state legislature. He was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2004. After his tenure, his wife, Wilhelmina Lewellen, succeeded him and served until 2010. Lewellen is notable for being the only Arkansas official elected to represent his district at the city, county, and state levels.


== Early life and education ==
Lewellen was born on September 16, 1930, in Forrest City, Arkansas. He was the eleventh of thirteen children born to Cornelius and Jesse Lewellen. He attended Dansby Elementary School and professed faith in Christianity at an early age. He graduated from Lincoln High School in Forrest City and served in the United States Air Force from 1951 to 1955 during the Korean War. Lewellen was the first in his family to attend college, enrolling at Arkansas AM&N (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff). There, he met Wilhelmina Epps, whom he married in 1956. They had two daughters, Ivie Rochelle and Cornelia Ann, while they completed their college education.

After graduating in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in agriculture, Lewellen moved with his family to the Altheimer/Hermitage area, where he worked as a high school teacher and principal.
