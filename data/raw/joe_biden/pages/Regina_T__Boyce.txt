Regina T. Boyce (born August 7, 1976) is an American politician who currently serves in the Maryland House of Delegates. Delegate Boyce is a Democrat who represents the 43rd Legislative District of the state of Maryland.


== Background ==
Boyce was born on August 7, 1976, in Washington, DC. She graduated from the Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Maryland and later attended Catonsville Community College and Towson University, where she earned a B.S. degree in kinesiology and psychology in 1998, and the University of Baltimore, where she earned a M.P.A. degree in 2014. After graduating, she became the director of the Adult Learning Center for Strong City Baltimore.
Boyce ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in 2018, her first run for elective office. During the primary election, she formed a slate with state Senator Joan Carter Conway and state Delegate Maggie McIntosh.


== In the Legislature ==
Boyce was sworn in as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates on January 9, 2019.
In April 2019, Boyce resigned from the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland ahead of the vote to protest comments made by Delegate Darryl Barnes, the caucus chair, that she found "unacceptable and infuriating". Barnes had cast doubt about whether African-American members of the House of Delegates would want to vote for "a white lesbian" – referring to Maggie McIntosh, who is openly gay – in the election to nominate a new Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates.
In August 2021, Boyce was appointed to a commission to study Maryland state parks and make recommendations on new parks in "recreational deserts" and upgrades to existing parks.
In 2023, Speaker Adrienne Jones announced Boyce as one of two Chief Deputy Whips.
During the 2025 legislative session she sponsored a bill, along with Marvin E. Holmes Jr., Nick Allen, Linda Foley, Wayne A. Hartman, and Denise Roberts, revising the 2023 mandate for funding of reserve studies and preparation of funding plans by housing cooperatives, condominiums, and homeowners associations.
