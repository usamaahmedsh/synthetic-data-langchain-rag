This is a list of opinion polls taken on the presidency of Joe Biden in 2023. To navigate between years, see opinion polling on the Biden administration. For 2024–2025 opinion polling, see 2024–2025 opinion polling on the Biden administration.
According to analysis by Gallup, Biden's average approval rating in 2023 was 39.8%. Compared with presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Gallup Poll only recorded one president, Jimmy Carter, as having a lower average approval rating in their third year (37.4%). Notably, this is the first year in which Joe Biden's average approval rating was lower than his predecessor's at the same point in their terms (Donald Trump's average in 2019 was 42.0%). Biden's low approval ratings in 2023 were attributed to continued disapproval over the economy, immigration, and Biden's age as well as his response to the outbreak of the Gaza war in October.
