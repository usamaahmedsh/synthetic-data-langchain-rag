== Lieutenant Governor of New York ==

On April 12, 2022, New York Lieutenant Governor Brian Benjamin resigned from office after being arrested in a corruption scandal. On May 3, 2022, New York Governor Kathy Hochul appointed Delgado lieutenant governor of New York. He was sworn in on May 25. Delgado is the first Latino to hold statewide office in New York.

On July 2, 2024, Hochul announced that she would run for reelection in 2026 with Delgado as her running mate. 
On July 10, 2024, Delgado called for President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election. His position on this issue conflicted with Hochul's, as she continued to support Biden's candidacy.
On February 13, 2025, Delgado called for New York City Mayor Eric Adams to resign from office. Following Delgado's statement, Hochul's office said that Delgado "does not now and has not ever spoken on behalf of this administration". City & State New York reported that the "legal and leadership crisis in New York City" was "exposing the rift" between Hochul and Delgado.
On February 24, 2025, Delgado announced that he would not seek reelection as lieutenant governor in 2026 and would explore other options. Hochul's office responded that Hochul "had already begun taking steps to identify a new running mate for 2026".
In August 2025, Politico reported that Delgado had conducted little official business in his role as lieutenant governor since announcing a primary challenge to incumbent governor Kathy Hochul. Politico wrote, "Hochul has made sure Delgado has stayed far away: The governor this year reduced her hand-picked lieutenant's staff to one employee. She revoked his executive email account. And she even seized his cell phone."

In June 2025, Delgado announced that he would challenge Hochul for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York in 2026.
