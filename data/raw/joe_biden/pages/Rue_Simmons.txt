Robin Rue Simmons (born March 12, 1976) is an American former politician and national leader for local reparations for African Americans.

From 2017 to 2021, Rue Simmons served as the alderman of the 5th Ward. As alderman, she led the passage of the United States' first government-funded reparations legislation. The local reparations initiative is being funded by the first $10 million of adult-use cannabis sales tax revenue collected by the City of Evanston. The first stage of the reparations program is focused on homeownership. After leaving office, Rue Simmons now serves as the chair of the City of Evanston's Reparations Committee.  
Rue Simmons is Founder and Executive Director of the not-for-profit FirstRepair, which "informs local reparations, nationally."
