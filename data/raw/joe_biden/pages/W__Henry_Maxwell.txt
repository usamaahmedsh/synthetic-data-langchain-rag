After the 1980 census, the Virginia House of Delegates switched entirely to single-member districts, after a year of legislative and legal wrangling.

The Democratic Party nominated Maxwell to replace Scott, and on January 11, 1983, he defeated Republican James W. Parker, getting 83.8% of the vote. The following November Maxwell won a full House term, gaining 74.5% of the vote against two independents.
Maxwell was reelected without opposition in 1985 and 1989. In 1987 and 1991, he defeated independent candidates, getting more than 80% of the vote each time.

In November 1992, Scott was elected to the United States House of Representatives. Maxwell was again nominated to fill Scott's vacancy, this time in the state Senate. On December 15, 1992, Maxwell won a four-way special election in the 2nd district, getting 39.1% of the votes, against 31.5% for Republican city councilman James O. West, 24.8% for former Newport News Mayor Jessie M. Rattley, and 4.5% for independent Joyce B. Hobson.Flora D. Crittenden won the special election in 1993 to succeed him as delegate.
Maxwell was unopposed for reelection to the Senate in 1995. In 1999, he received 80% of the vote against independent Michael A. Rogers, Sr. Senator Maxwell served on the Committees on Rehabilitation and Social Services, Commerce and Labor, General Laws, and Transportation.
