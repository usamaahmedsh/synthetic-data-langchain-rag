Ismail Mohamed is an American attorney and politician who is the representative for Ohio House District 3. He won the primary on August 2, 2022, and won in the November 2022 general election. He and Munira Abdullahi are the first two Somali American representatives in Ohio. 
Mohamed was born into a refugee family that was displaced from Somalia to Kenya and Ethiopia before eventually seeking refuge in the United States and attending Northland High School. Mohamed is an alum of the Moritz College of Law.
In 2022, Mohamed took office after unseating Republican J. Josiah Lanning with about 80% of the vote. Mohamed is one of the city's first Somali-born attorneys licensed to practice in Ohio. His priorities have included lowering housing costs, supporting small businesses and increased funding for public education.
Mohamed, who backs congressional term limits, is also a member of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus and has pushed for expungement for minor marijuana offenses. In 2025, Mohamed introduced a bill that would increase the minimum wage.
