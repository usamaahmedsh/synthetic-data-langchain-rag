Executive Order 14006, officially titled Reforming Our Incarceration System to Eliminate the Use of Privately Operated Criminal Detention Facilities, is an executive order signed by U.S. President Joe Biden on January 26, 2021. Under this order, Department of Justice would not renew any existing contracts with privately operated prisons. This order was rescinded as a part of U.S. President Donald Trump's "Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions" executive order on January 20, 2025.

It aimed to gradually abolish the US government's reliance on privately operated detention facilities as they tend to not have the same level of safety as state-owned ones.
