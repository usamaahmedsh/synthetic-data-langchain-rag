The district includes most of the Black Belt, as well as most of the predominantly African American portions of Birmingham and Tuscaloosa.
A native of Huntsville, Sewell studied at Princeton University for a bachelor's, Harvard Law School for a Juris Doctor degree, and St Hilda's College, Oxford for a second bachelor's that was promoted by tradition to an MA. Before entering politics, she was a securities lawyer for Davis Polk & Wardwell and a public finance lawyer for Maynard, Cooper & Gale, where she was the first Black woman to make partner. She is the first African-American woman elected to Congress from Alabama and, along with Republican Martha Roby, was one of the first women elected to Congress from Alabama in a regular election.


== Early life and education ==
Terri Sewell was born in Huntsville, Alabama, to Andrew A. Sewell, a former high school basketball coach, and Nancy Gardner Sewell, a retired high school librarian and former Selma city council member. Her mother was the first Black woman elected to Selma's city council.
As a child, Sewell wanted to be a star on Broadway. Because her mother had hoped for her to become a lawyer, Sewell joined the debate team in high school. She was the first Black valedictorian of Selma High School.
After graduating from high school, Sewell went to Princeton University. She was the first Selma High School graduate to attend an Ivy League school. She was recruited to attend Princeton by Julian L. McPhillips, who read about her in the local Selma newspaper. At Princeton, she befriended Michelle Obama, who served as what Sewell called her "big sister" on campus. Sewell completed a 158-page long senior thesis, "Black Women in Politics: Our Time Has Come". During her time at Princeton, she interned with Richard Shelby (then a Democrat) and Howell Heflin.
After graduating from Princeton in 1986, Sewell attended St Hilda's College, Oxford where she was a Marshall Scholar. It was there that she befriended Susan Rice. Her thesis was on the election of the first black members of the British parliament, and later published as a book, Black Tribunes: Race and Representation in British Politics (1993). Sewell graduated from Oxford with a degree in political science in 1988. She attended Harvard Law School for her Juris Doctor, which she completed in 1992. There she overlapped with and was friends with Barack Obama, who became a lifelong friend and influenced Sewell's decision to enter politics.


== Early career ==
After graduation, Sewell served as a judicial law clerk in Birmingham, Alabama, to Chief Judge U. W. Clemon, In New York, she worked at Davis Polk & Wardwell, alongside Kirsten Gillibrand, starting in 1994.
Sewell returned to Alabama in 2004 due to her father's health problems. She worked for another law firm, Maynard, Cooper & Gale PC, where she was the first black woman partner. She was a public finance lawyer.
In 2007, Sewell was at Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, where she is a member, when then Senator Barack Obama spoke during the 2008 United States presidential election. Sewell credits Obama's speech (in which he asked "[t]he questions that I have today is, what's called of us in this Joshua generation? What do we do in order to fulfill that legacy, to fulfill the obligations and the debt that we owe to those who allowed us to be here today?") as the catalyst for her serving in politics. Weeks after his speech, Gillibrand called Sewell, recruiting Sewell to run for office.
