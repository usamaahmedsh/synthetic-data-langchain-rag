On the second night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, a roll call of the states was ceremonially held. Due to the then-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the roll call and convention were held virtually rather than in a single venue. Also due to the pandemic, formal voting on the party's nomination was done virtually and in advance of the convention, making the roll call at the convention purely ceremonial.
The roll call saw participation by all of the convention's 57 delegations (including all 50 states and seven additional territories/jurisdictions (the District of Columbia, the five inhabited U.S. territories, and Democrats Abroad). Organizers planned for it to last approximately 30 minutes. Convention secretary Jason Rae directed the roll call from Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee.
The production of the remote roll call was widely praised.
