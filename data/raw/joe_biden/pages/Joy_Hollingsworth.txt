=== 2023 election ===
In January 2023, Hollingsworth announced that she would be running to represent District 3 on the Seattle City Council. In her announcement, Hollingsworth state she would "develop and promote progressive and practical strategies to address root causes..." Later that week, incumbent Kshama Sawant, the council's only socialist member, announced that she would not run for reelection.
In the primary, Mayor Bruce Harrell endorsed Hollingsworth of the eight challengers for the open seat. She earned the most votes in the August election, with 36.87% of the vote, and advancing to the general election alongside transportation advocate Alex Hudson, who earned 36.53%. Hollingsworth and Hudson agreed that homelessness, housing affordability, and public safety, but differed on approach, with Hollingsworth supporting moderate solutions and Hudson more progressive ones. Hollingsworth advocated for increasing police staffing and supported the city council's bill to prosecute low-level drug offenses, while Hudson advocated for greater community investments and police alternatives.
In the November general election, Hollingsworth defeated Hudson, 52.94% to 46.71%.


=== Tenure ===
Hollingsworth took office on January 2, 2024. She was sworn in with five other new council members who all ran on a moderate platform, representing the largest turnover in the city council since 1911.
In July 2024, Hollingsworth proposed legislation that would continue exempting businesses with less than 500 employees from matching the minimum wage for companies with 500+ employees and increasing the minimum wage based on inflation. The plan was meant to advert small businesses from wages increasing by $3 per hour. After public backlash from citizens, workers, and labor organizers, Hollingsworth pulled the bill, though she vowed to continue to advance the bill in the future.
Hollingsworth also voted in favor of the controversial exclusionary zones known as the Stay Out of Drug Areas (SODA) and Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution (SOAP). She added amendments that would create a SODA zone in the Capital Hill neighborhood to disrupt drug trafficking in the area.
