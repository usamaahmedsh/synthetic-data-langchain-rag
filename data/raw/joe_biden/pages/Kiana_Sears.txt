Kiana Maria Sears (born 1974/1975) is an American politician serving in the Arizona Senate for 9th district. She was appointed to the role by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in 2025 to succeed Eva Burch, who resigned.


== Early life and education ==
A native of New Orleans, Louisiana, Sears grew up in New Orleans East and moved to Arizona in 1995 with her husband. Sears earned a B.A. in intercultural communications with a minor in business administration (marketing and management) from Arizona State University (ASU). She later received a M.P.A. in human resources and management from ASU's School of Public Affairs, College of Public Programs. Sears completed a certificate in regulatory studies through the Institute of Public Utilities (IPU) and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARU) Rate School at Michigan State University.


== Career ==
Sears began her career in public policy as a Child Public Policy Intern with the Children's Action Alliance from 1998 to 1999, where she worked on legislation concerning foster care. During the 2001 legislative session, she served as a research staff member in the Arizona Senate, preparing bill summaries, drafting amendments, and briefing legislators.
From 2008 to 2014, Sears worked as an executive consultant at the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC). Her responsibilities included preparing staff reports, testifying at hearings, and coordinating across departments on regulatory matters related to public utilities. Sears served on the Mesa Public Schools board for nine years 2016 to 2025.
In 2018, she unsuccessfully ran for the ACC, placing fourth in the general election with 24% of the vote. The Arizona Secretary of State's office found that Sears violated financial disclosure laws by failing to report all of her and her husband's businesses, many of which were inactive LLCs. The Arizona Attorney General office was referred to the complaint but declared Sears did not violate the law, finding that she made a mistake and accepted amended filings.
Starting in October 2018, Sears served as assistant director of Faith Based Outreach and Community Partnerships at ASU, where she worked on initiatives to support underrepresented student populations and create college-readiness programs in collaboration with community organizations.
In 2024, she ran for justice of the peace in Maricopa County's North Mesa Precinct, losing to Republican incumbent Kyle Jones with 42.2% of the vote.
