==== Controversies ====
In 2023, Michigan Supreme Court Justice Richard H. Bernstein drew controversy after Bolden hired Pete Martel, who spent fourteen years in prison for armed robbery before attending Wayne State University Law School, as a law clerk.  Bernstein publicly stated that he was "completely disgusted" by  Bolden's decision to hire Martel as a law clerk and claimed that he and Justice Bolden "don't share the same values".   He also claimed that Bolden's decision to hire Martel would reflect poorly on the entire court and that it was not "fair to the police and the prosecutors" to have a convicted felon working for the court.  Bolden confirmed that Martel had resigned from his position as a law clerk due to Bernstein's comments and explained that Martel "did not want to be a distraction or in any way divert the court from its important work". On January 9, 2023 Bernstein issued a statement saying he apologized to Bolden in person at the Hall of Justice and that she accepted his apology.
