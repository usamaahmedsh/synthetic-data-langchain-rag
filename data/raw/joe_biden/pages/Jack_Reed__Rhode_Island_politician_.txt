His father's family was Anglo-American but had become Catholic, and his mother's family was Irish-American. Reed graduated from La Salle Academy and the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1971.

After leaving active duty, Reed enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he became a member of the Board of Student Advisers. In 1982, he graduated with his Juris Doctor and worked as an associate at the Washington, D.C. office of law firm of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan.

=== Elections ===


==== 1996 ====

When Senator Claiborne Pell, the longest-serving senator in Rhode Island's history and the 13th longest-serving senator in US history, announced his retirement in 1996, Reed declared his candidacy. Reed won the Democratic primary with 86% of the vote and beat the Republican nominee, Rhode Island General Treasurer Nancy Mayer, 63% to 35%.


==== 2002 ====

Reed ran for a second term. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary and his Republican opponent was Robert Tingle, a casino pit manager and the unsuccessful Republican nominee for the state's 2nd congressional district in 2000. Reed won by 78% to 22%.


==== 2008 ====

Reed ran for a third term. He won the Democratic primary with 87% of the vote. In the general election, he faced a rematch with Tingle, again winning in a landslide, 73% to 27%.


==== 2014 ====

Reed ran for a fourth term. Polling showed him leading prospective Republican opponents by margins of between 29% and 65%.

=== Executive branch rumors ===
In 2008, Reed was mentioned as a potential vice presidential running mate for Barack Obama. On July 14, 2008, Reed announced that he was "not interested" in becoming Obama's running mate.
Reed has consistently been mentioned as a possible Secretary of Defense. In late 2010, he turned down Obama's offer to succeed Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. The position was ultimately filled by Leon Panetta. After Obama was reelected in 2012 and Panetta announced his decision to retire, Reed was again mentioned as a possible nominee for the position, as well as for Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Once again, he denied interest in either position.
When Panetta's successor Chuck Hagel announced his resignation in December 2014, Reed was again said to be on Obama's shortlist. Despite the Republican takeover of the Senate in the 2014 elections, it was said that Reed's confirmation would be a "foregone conclusion". He again denied interest, with a spokesman saying, "Senator Reed loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island in the United States Senate. He has made it very clear that he does not wish to be considered for Secretary of Defense or any other cabinet position. He just asked the people of Rhode Island to hire him for another six-year term and plans on honoring that commitment."
On November 24, 2014, Ted Nesi of WPRI-TV gave some reasons that Reed might be uninterested in cabinet positions, citing his "safe seat", his status as one of the most popular politicians in the state, his fondness for working in the Senate and his passion for housing policy. He concluded that "no matter how many times Reed's aides privately groan about another flareup of defense secretary speculation, they surely appreciate that each recurrence is a sign of the senator's positive reputation in Washington and Obama's esteem for him."

He also supported LGBTQ rights, voting against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and in favor of measures that prevent job discrimination and hate crimes against LGBTQ people.


=== Economy and jobs ===
Reed has generally supported fair trade policies over similar ones advocating free trade. He voted against renewing presidential authority to "fast-track" normalized trade relations. Reed opposed the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement and similar free trade proposals for Chile, Singapore, Peru, and Oman, but voted in favor of normalizing trade relations with China. He has also been a strong supporter of unionizing workers, and has criticized government and business interference with these groups. Reed supports increasing the minimum wage and unemployment compensation.
Reed serves on the Senate Banking Committee, which has held hearings into JP Morgan Chase bank's activities. He has accepted campaign contributions from its CEO Jamie Dimon.


=== Foreign policy ===

During the Iran-Israel war of 2025, Reed said: "Israel's alarming decision to launch airstrikes on Iran is a reckless escalation that risks igniting regional violence".


=== Election security ===
In July 2019, Reed and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar sent a letter to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan requesting an explanation of the actions the Department of Homeland Security took in response to "unexpected behavior" of voting equipment in Durham County, North Carolina during the 2016 presidential election and writing that it was "critical that we learn as much as we can about the extent of the attacks we faced in 2016, and that these lessons be shared as widely as possible so that our nation is fully prepared for the 2020 elections."


=== Energy ===
Reed supports limiting American oil use and expanding alternative energy. He opposes Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling and federal subsidies for oil exploration, while favoring a 40% reduction in oil use by 2025 and funding for hydrogen automobiles. Reed has voted to end discussions on Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and has been an outspoken proponent of stronger restrictions of mercury use, as well as an end to commercial whaling.


=== Gun control ===
Reed supports gun control. He also supports a national assault weapon ban. Reed has voted against limiting lawsuits on gun manufacturers and has favored expanding gun control. He also voted against loosening background checks at gun shows.


=== Healthcare ===
Reed has been an advocate of preventive healthcare. Like many other Democrats, he supports increasing Medicare funding, enrolling more Americans into programs that help the uninsured, allowing prescription drugs to be imported from Canada, and negotiating bulk medication purchases for Medicare in order to lower costs. Reed does not support Medicare for All. Instead, in 2019 he proposed the Choose Medicare Act, which he claims increases "access, competition, and choice."


=== Immigration ===
Even though he voted for the 1996 Immigration Reform Bill, Reed has generally supported allowing illegal immigrants and foreign workers to enter the path to citizenship. He supports Guest Worker programs and giving immigrants access to Social Security. He opposed establishing English as the nation's official language and has been critical of the effort to fence the US-Mexican border. He is the author of the Reed Amendment, which permits former U.S. citizens to be denied entry to the country if they are believed to have renounced their citizenship for tax reasons. On February 23, 2010, Reed co-sponsored the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation that would allow undocumented students living in the United States from a very young age to gain legal status.


=== LGBTQIA+ rights ===
In October 2018, Reed was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rollback of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQIA+ individuals "subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities", and that the US refusing to let LGBTQIA+ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be tantamount to upholding "the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world."
Reed supports transgender rights. He opposes a ban in the military that prevents military recruits and transgender troops from transitioning to another gender.


=== War in Iraq ===
Reed was one of 23 US senators to vote against H.J. Resolution 114, which authorized President George W. Bush to use force against Iraq in 2002. In 2007, he elaborated on his sentiments, saying, "It was a flawed strategy that diverted attention and resources away from hunting down Osama bin Laden's terrorist network." Like David Petraeus, Reed said he believed the real problems in Iraq were political and unrelated to the military.


=== War in Yemen ===
In 2018, Reed was one a few Democrats to support U.S. backing of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. By 2019 he reversed his position, saying that he wanted to end U.S. support for the coalition. A network of progressive groups, including Demand Progress, Working Families Party, and Chapo Trap House, urged Reed to ensure that the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act withdrew support for the war.


=== Nagorno–Karabakh conflict ===
On October 1, 2020, Reed co-signed a letter to then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that condemned Azerbaijan’s offensive operations against the Republic of Artsakh, denounced Turkey’s role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and called for an immediate ceasefire. Reed said, "Armenians have a right to defend themselves when attacked."


=== War in Afghanistan ===
Reed supported President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by September 2021. He said that "the president made a difficult, but the best of many poor choices."


=== Artificial intelligence ===
In June 2024, Reed joined Senators Mitt Romney, Jerry Moran, and Angus King in proposing a framework to mitigate the existential risk from artificial general intelligence. They said the framework "would apply to only the very largest and most advanced models" and would guard against threats to humans posed by AI.
