Tysons, also known as Tysons Corner, is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States, spanning from the corner of SR 123  (Chain Bridge Road) and SR 7 (Leesburg Pike). It is part of the Washington metropolitan area and located in Northern Virginia between McLean and Vienna along the I-495.

As an unincorporated community, Tysons is Fairfax County's central business district and a regional commercial center. It has been called a quintessential example of an edge city. The population was 26,374 as of the 2020 census.


== History ==


=== 19th century ===
Known originally as Peach Grove, the area received the designation "Tysons Crossroads" after the Civil War. William Tyson, a Maryland native from Cecil County, purchased a tract of land from A. Lawrence Foster. Tyson served as postmaster of the now discontinued Peach Grove Post Office from 1854 to 1866.


=== 20th century ===
As recently as the 1950s, Tysons was a quiet rural intersection flanked by a few small stores and a fruit stand operated by the Tyson descendants, who sold apples and apple cider from the corner of their property. In 1963, the Tysons area moved from a country crossroads to a giant commercial urban area with the awarding of contracts at the interchange of VA Route 7 and VA Route 123.
In 1962, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors approved the Tysons Corner Shopping Center, now Tysons Corner Center, which was planned to be 88.13 acres (356,600 m2) within a 150 acres (0.61 km2) triangle bordered by Chain Bridge Road, Leesburg Pike, and the Capital Beltway. Developers proclaimed it the largest enclosed mall in the world when it opened on July 25, 1968.


=== 21st century ===

In the early 21st century, an influx of technology companies into Northern Virginia led to new office buildings and hotels to the landscape. The rapid growth of Tysons in comparison to other locations near the Capital Beltway has been the topic of numerous studies. One factor was the aggressive promotion of Tysons by Earle Williams, for many years the CEO of the defense contracting firm Braddock Dunn & McDonald. Tysons serves as a downtown of Fairfax County, with one quarter of all office space and one eighth of all retail in the county, despite occupying just 1% of the county. It is an auto-oriented edge city with severe traffic congestion, and faces competition from the urban areas of Arlington and newer suburban edge cities such as Dulles.
In 2008, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to begin a 40-year plan to urbanize Tysons around the coming four stops of Washington Metro's Silver Line in the vein of neighboring Arlington County's Rosslyn-Ballston corridor. A preliminary estimate from the Fairfax County Department of Transportation suggested that $7.83 billion in transportation infrastructure projects would be necessary to transform Tysons Corner into a high-density urban center from 2010 to 2050, most of which would be allocated to both construction phases of the Silver Line. Existing plans call for construction of a grid layout for streets around the rail stations, projected to cost $742 million. An additional $1 billion will be spent on further transit and street grid projects from 2030 to 2050.
In November 2012, the county approved Arbor Row, a 2,500,000 ft (762,000 m) mixed-used development of office and residential high-rises, ground-floor retail, and underground parking near the Tysons Corner (now Tysons) station. In April 2013, the county approved Scotts Run Station South, a 6,700,000 ft (2,042,160 m) development containing 17 buildings, including six office and residential buildings, one hotel, and ground-floor retail near the McLean Station. This development alone will be larger than Reston Town Center.
Ahead of the Washington Metro Silver Line opening in mid-2014, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and the Tysons Partnership, a nonprofit association that represents the area's stakeholders, began rebranding the area as simply "Tysons", dropping "Corner" from the name. The change started as a matter of convenience, but later took hold to market the change in the area's character, according to members of the board. The change was unofficial at the time, and either "Tysons" or "Tysons Corner" could be used in addresses. But in November 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau announced the CDP's name would officially be changed to Tysons as of the next summer.
Tysons is seen as a modern prototype of an edge city. In its 40-year history, it has been given substantial redevelopment offers for the next 20 to 30 years. The area has seen growing interest as plans to make it an urban center were begun in 2010. Private-sector development in the United States in combination with political groups have begun the planning process behind the redevelopment of Tysons. Two forces are at work in the creation of an edge city, as it can be beneficial to both parties. With the redevelopment process taking place there has been an aggressive push to bring in businesses to Tysons. Edge cities such as Tysons have specific regional accessibility that has been enhanced by major projects funded by federal and state governments. One of the bigger enhancements to transportation specifically to Tysons was the construction "of the Washington Dulles International Airport and an associated access road and the Capital Beltway but also expansions to state roads".
The plan remains to see Tysons become Fairfax County's downtown core. So far, "eight districts have been delimited, with four centered on new metro stations being transit-oriented development districts". Future plans for transportation around the area continue to be made. "The aims of the plan are for 75% of development to be within half a mile of metro stations, an urban center of 200,000 jobs and 100,000 residents, a jobs balance of 4.0 per household".

== Demographics ==

Tysons was one of the inspirations for, and figures prominently in, Joel Garreau's pioneering study of the edge city phenomenon.  Among the reasons for calling Tysons an edge city is that, in contrast to typical "bedroom" suburbs, people commute into it in the morning and away from it at night, with a daytime population greater than 100,000 and a nighttime population of fewer than 20,000. Planners envision up to 200,000 jobs and 100,000 residents in coming decades.

Due to its large daytime population, Tysons experiences high traffic congestion. This has led to plans for denser development, including additional rail infrastructure.

The bridge opened to traffic in 2018, and work was completed in 2020. The connection improved the operations along the adjacent road systems. This connection extended and widened existing lanes eastward along Scotts Crossing Road, ending at Route 123 adjacent to the McLean Metro Station.
