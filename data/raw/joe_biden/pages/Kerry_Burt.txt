Burt was arrested in February 2009 in Ankeny, Iowa after driving drunk and causing an auto accident. He pleaded guilty to the charge.
He took office in January 2009 and, in April 2010, announced that he would not seek re-election for the November 2010 elections because he was legally charged with tampering with school records. Court documents alleged that Burt used an inaccurate home address in Cedar Falls to enroll his child in the school, and that using the address allowed him to avoid paying higher tuition.
