List of foreign visits by foreign leaders to Joe Biden catalogs all official visits to the United States by heads of state or government that involved meetings with President Joe Biden during his tenure as the 46th President of the United States. These visits—ranging from state and working visits to official and summit participations—highlight the diplomatic engagements between the Biden administration and global leaders.
The data is sourced primarily from the U.S. Department of State’s Office of the Historian, which compiles annual lists of visits in its Department History — Visits by Foreign Leaders archive. It includes:

State Visits: Formal visits by heads of state, entailing ceremonial activities and high-level bilateral discussions.
Working Visits: Less formal, typically focused on policy or crisis management.
Official Visits: Intermediate in formality, often with scheduled meetings and a ceremonial agenda.
Summit Attendance: Visits tied to multilateral summits or gatherings of regional or international groupings.
Entries are organized chronologically by year—from the start of Biden’s presidency on January 20, 2021, through the most recent update—and detail for each visit: the leader’s name, country, visit type/event, and date(s).
The article is structured into major sections by calendar years (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024), each containing a table of visits. Additional sections may include summary statistics (e.g., visits per country), types of visits, and context such as coinciding summits or global events.
