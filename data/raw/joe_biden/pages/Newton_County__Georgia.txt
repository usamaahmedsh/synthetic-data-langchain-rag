== History ==
Newton county is named after Sgt. John Newton, who served under Gen. Francis Marion, the "Swamp Fox", in the American Revolutionary War. It was created on December 24, 1821.
During the American Civil War, the county provided the Lamar Infantry, which was a part of Cobb's Legion. The 1860 census shows the enslaved population was nearly half, 45.2 percent. Newton County adjoins Jasper County: Georgia is one of many states that have a Newton County and a Jasper County that border each other.
In late 1978, the first five episodes of The Dukes of Hazzard were filmed in and around Covington, Georgia. The TV series In The Heat of the Night was filmed in Covington from 1988 to 1995. Also, in Remember the Titans, there were many scenes shot on "The Square" and the final football scene was shot at Homer Sharp Stadium, which is located near downtown Covington. Currently part of the new series The Vampire Diaries is being filmed on "The Square". Additionally, major films including My Cousin Vinny, Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives and Halloween II, Rob Zombie's sequel to his 2007 film Halloween, were also filmed near and around "The Square" in downtown Covington.

== Politics ==
As of the 2020s, Newton County is a usually Democratic voting county. For the first half of the 20th century, Newton County followed the regular Solid South pattern of voting Democratic. It would later become a state bellwether from 1968 to 2004—meaning that the county's voting intention was an accurate predictor of the overall statewide winner. From 2008 to 2016, Newton County had been narrowly won by Democrats thanks to its location within the Atlanta metro as well as the influx of progressive voters both the region and Newton proper have experienced in recent years. This margin ballooned to a double-digit percentage in 2020 when Joe Biden flipped the state back into the Democratic column; Kamala Harris built upon this margin four years later, winning Newton by just over 15% even as she narrowly lost Georgia and the election.

For elections to the United States House of Representatives, Newton County is part of Georgia's 10th congressional district, currently represented by Mike Collins. For elections to the Georgia State Senate, Newton County is divided between districts 42 and 43. For elections to the Georgia House of Representatives, Newton County is part of districts 113, 114 and 118.
