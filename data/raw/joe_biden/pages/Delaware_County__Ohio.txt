== History ==
The area including Delaware County was once home to numerous Native American tribes. In 1804, Colonel Moses Byxbe and Henry Baldwin, among others, migrated to central Ohio from Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and built a town on the west bank of the Olentangy River. On February 10, 1808, the Ohio government authorized the creation of Delaware County. Following the War of 1812, settlers began to arrive in the county and settled down in Delaware. The town was incorporated in 1816, being the first incorporated town in the county. Powell, originally named Middlebury, was founded in 1801, but was not incorporated until 1947. Sunbury was founded in 1816. Ohio Wesleyan University, a liberal arts college, was founded by Methodists in 1842.
Delaware County had Northern sympathies during the Civil War, and abolitionists brought the Underground Railroad through the area. A local road, Africa Road, derives its name from the era. Camp Delaware was one of the few Civil War camps that deployed African American soldiers. The Civil War played an important part in Delaware County's growth, bringing railroad business and technology. By 1900, Delaware had its first electric streetway, and an electric interurban railroad connecting Marion and Columbus ran through the county. The Little Brown Jug race was founded in 1946, and is one of the races in the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers.
In 2008, Forbes magazine ranked Delaware County as the fifth best place in the United States to raise a family and the second best in Ohio, behind Geauga County. In 2020, Delaware was rated the best county to live in Ohio and 24th in the United States by Niche, 17th healthiest county by US News, and 24th best counties to live in by 247WallSt.

== Politics ==

Delaware County is considered a Republican stronghold, and has been for most of the party's history. The county is very well-educated, with an estimated 58% of its adult population having bachelor's degrees. It is the most highly educated county in Ohio.  The only Democratic presidential candidate to win the county from 1856 to the present day was Woodrow Wilson in his 1912 and 1916 electoral victories.
However, in 2020, Joe Biden came within single digits of flipping the county, the closest result since Lyndon Johnson's landslide victory in 1964. The growth of suburban Columbus, which has been growing increasingly Democratic in recent years, is one of the factors driving Delaware County away from its former overwhelming Republican support. In 2024, Kamala Harris won 46% of the vote in the county, the highest percentage for a Democratic presidential nominee since 1964.
In August 2023, the county voted against Ohio Issue 1, which would have changed the threshold required to modify the Ohio Constitution, by a margin of 57.72-42.28. In November 2023, the county voted for Issue 1, which amended the state constitution to guarantee a woman's reproductive rights, by a margin of 59.21%-40.79%.
