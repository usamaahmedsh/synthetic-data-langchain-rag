André Darryl Carson (born October 16, 1974) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Indiana's 7th congressional district since 2008. A member of the Democratic Party, his district includes the northern four-fifths of Indianapolis, including Downtown Indianapolis. He became the dean of Indiana's congressional delegation after fellow Democrat Pete Visclosky retired in 2021.
Carson is the grandson of his predecessor, U.S. Representative Julia Carson (1938–2007), whose death in office triggered a special election. He was the second Muslim to be elected to Congress, after Keith Ellison of Minnesota.


== Personal life and early career ==
André Carson was born and raised in Indianapolis. He graduated from Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in criminal justice and management from Concordia University Wisconsin (2003), and a Master of Science degree in business management from Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, Indiana (2005). At a young age, Carson's interest in public service was shaped by his grandmother, the late Congresswoman Julia Carson. Carson grew up in a rough neighborhood, and he credits that experience for shaping his policy views on issues like education, public safety and economic opportunity. He has been married to Mariama Shaheed.
From 1996 to 2005, Carson worked as a compliance officer for the Indiana State Excise Police, the law enforcement arm of the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission. He was later employed in the anti-terrorism division of Indiana's Department of Homeland Security and then as a marketing specialist for Cripe Architects + Engineers in Indianapolis. He served as a member of the Indianapolis/Marion city-county council from 2007 to 2008.
In December 2007, Julia Carson, who had represented Indiana's 7th district in Congress since 1997, died of lung cancer. Three months later, Carson won a special election for his grandmother's vacant House seat. Carson has retained the seat ever since.
Before being elected to public office, Carson was a Democratic Party Committeeperson in Indianapolis. In 2007, he won a special caucus of the Marion County Democratic Party to become the City-County Councilor for the 15th Council district of Indianapolis-Marion County.

On March 20, 2010, Carson told reporters that health care protesters outside the Capitol hurled racial slurs at fellow Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) member John Lewis. Carson came off the House floor and told reporters his story about health care protesters hurling racial slurs during their walk from the Cannon House Office Building to the chambers. Although audio and video recordings of the protest have been posted online, no proof of the racial slurs has yet been provided, and the reward remains unclaimed.
On August 28, 2011, Carson addressed a gathering of supporters and mentioned the Tea Party movement during his speech. "This is the effort that we're seeing of Jim Crow," Carson said. "Some of these folks in Congress right now would love to see us as second-class citizens. Some of them in Congress right now of this Tea Party movement would love to see you and me... hanging on a tree." Carson declined calls to resign, reaffirming, "I stand on the truth of what I spoke", and clarified that his comments were directed at certain Tea Party leaders and not the movement as a whole.
On December 18, 2019, Carson voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump and was one of only two House members from Indiana to do so, along with Pete Visclosky.

This act included increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.
The ARRA led to billions of dollars in investment in Carson's district, including grants to hire more police officers and save teaching jobs, and landmark investments in green technology that created hundreds of new jobs.


==== Consumer protection ====
On June 26, 2009, Carson introduced the Jeremy Warriner Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 3088), which would require General Motors and Chrysler to carry liability insurance that would cover vehicles produced before they filed for bankruptcy in early 2009.

On the same date, he issued a press release clarifying his position that no "particular faith should be the foundation of our public schools."


=== Energy and environment ===
Carson has supported investment in the development of new technologies to reduce American dependence on foreign oil, create new jobs and begin to mitigate fossil fuels' adverse environmental effects.

==== Afghanistan and Iraq ====
Carson believes that "American efforts to capture and kill al Qaeda terrorists have greatly diminished" because of the Iraq War. During the War in Afghanistan, Carson often stated his belief that al Qaeda and the Taliban posed the most imminent threat to the United States. Accordingly, he pushed for a reduction of troops in Iraq to cover the needs of the War in Afghanistan.


==== Disease prevention ====

On July 24, 2008, Carson voted to pass the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act (H.R. 5501) which provided aid to developing countries fighting high rates of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. He successfully amended the bill to create "a transatlantic, technological medium of exchange that allows African scientists and American medical professionals to collaborate on the best methods for treating and preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS on the African continent."


==== Israel and Palestine ====

Carson is opposed to Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory — which are considered illegal under international human rights law and Article 49 of the Geneva Convention — calling them "illegitimate and a major barrier to peace". In July 2019, Carson voted against a House resolution condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. In August 2021, he wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to call for an investigation into American charities supporting Israeli settlements.

In 2022, Carson introduced the Justice For Shireen Act, in response to the killing of American journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh by the IDF. That same year, he criticized the Israeli criminalization of human rights organizations, stating on Twitter, "I am upset by the latest attacks by the Israeli army on Palestinian human rights groups. Silencing human rights defenders is an attempt to avoid accountability. I reiterate calls from myself and my colleagues that the Biden administration immediately condemn this repression."

On October 25, 2023, Carson and eight other progressive Democrats (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush,  Al Green, Summer Lee, Ilhan Omar, Delia Ramirez, and Rashida Tlaib), along with Republican Thomas Massie, voted against congressional bi-partisan non-binding resolution H. Res. 771 supporting Israel in the wake of the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. The resolution stated that the House of Representatives: "stands with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists" and "reaffirms the United States' commitment to Israel's security"; the resolution passed by an overwhelming 412-10-6 margin.
Carson introduced a bill in March 2025 to restore funding to UNRWA that had been previously cut.


==== Syria ====
In 2023, Carson was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.


=== Health care reform ===
Carson is a strong supporter of health care reform legislation that increases access to medical care for millions of uninsured Americans and provides a more stable system for those at risk of losing their health insurance. On July 30, 2009, he signed a letter from the Congressional Progressive Caucus to House leadership, calling for a robust public option to be included in any health care reform bill.
He has opposed taxes both on the medical device industry and employer-provided health insurance plans as a means to pay for health care reform. Instead, he has called for finding savings in the current health system by reducing waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare system, as well as implementing a surcharge on the wealthiest Americans as a means to cover the costs of reform. He has also voiced his opposition for health care reform legislation that increases the deficit.
On November 7, 2009, Carson voted to pass H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, the House version of legislation designed to reform the American health insurance industry.

He authored an amendment to the legislation that funded the distribution of information about foreclosure rescue scams through targeted mailings.


=== National security ===

Carson is the only member of Congress to have served in a Department of Homeland Security Fusion Center. He has voted to increase appropriations funding for the Department of Homeland Security. In 2017, Carson attended a protest at Indianapolis International Airport against President Trump's executive order to temporarily place limits on immigration until better screening methods are devised. Carson decried the executive order as part of a "bigotry campaign", saying: "For those who want to make America great again, we have to remind them that the first article of the constitution says Congress shall make no law respecting [the] establishment of religion. Make no mistake about it: This is a Muslim ban."


=== Public safety ===
In 2009, Carson introduced two pieces of legislation aimed at reducing recidivism. The Recidivism Reduction Act (H.R. 2829) aims to attack the cycle of recidivism by ensuring prompt access to federal supplemental security income and Medicaid benefits for ex-offenders reentering society and addressing the gap in mental health services. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act would repeal federal laws that prevent drug felons from receiving TANF benefits.
In 2008, Carson helped the City of Indianapolis secure a federal COPS grant to hire more police officers. The grant was awarded as part of the ARRA.
