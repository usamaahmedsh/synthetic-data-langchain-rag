==== Nomination ====
On July 19, 2021, Steele was nominated as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions, a position that oversees the federal Office of Financial Institutions. Steele's nomination was praised by environmentalist group Evergreen Action, which stated in a press release that Steele "understands the systemic risk that climate change poses to the financial system, and is committed to leading federal regulators in confronting these dangers." Brown, Steele's former employer, also endorsed the nomination, stating that Steele's support for combatting income inequality makes him a strong fit for the role.
On September 21, 2021, the Senate Banking Committee held hearings on Steele's nomination. The committee voted to favorably report Steele's nomination to the Senate floor on October 5, 2021. On November 16, 2021, the entire Senate confirmed Steele's nomination in a vote of 53-42.


=== Tenure ===
In November 2023, it was reported that Steele would resign from the position. He formally left the position in January 2024.


== Views ==
Steele is considered a member of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, having supported the presidential campaign of Elizabeth Warren in 2020. Steele has indicated his opposition to the renomination of Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve.


=== Climate policy ===
In a March 2020 paper published in the Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy, Steele argued that the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank) law gave federal officials the power to use macroprudential regulation to address climate-related financial risks. According to Steele, federal bodies with this power include the Financial Stability Oversight Council as well as the Federal Reserve.
According to a Wall Street Journal article about his nomination, Steele believes that the Federal Reserve "could use its authority to limit fossil-fuel investments based on their prospective risks to financial stability..."


=== Derivatives regulations ===
In a 2019 letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Steele argued in favor of restricting derivatives trading to minimize the risk the market poses to the global economy.
