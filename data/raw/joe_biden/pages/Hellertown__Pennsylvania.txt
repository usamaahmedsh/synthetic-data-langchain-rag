== History ==


=== Pre-settlement ===
The area of present-day Hellertown was inhabited by various American Indian groups and European settlers.


=== 18th century ===
Hellertown was founded in 1742 by Johann Christoph(er) Heller and his son Johann Simon Heller. The family were Palatines that left Rotterdam on September 5, 1738 and landed in Philadelphia. Christopher obtained the patent for his land September 8, 1742, and Simon received his patent October 14, 1746. Together they owned a 176 acre property at the southern foot of the Lehigh Mountain along the Saucon Creek and constructed the family plantation named "Delay".


=== 19th century ===
In 1820, the town contained thirteen houses, eighteen families, three taverns, two stores, one grist-mill, and seventy-three inhabitants. The town specialized in the production of linseed oil. The first school in Hellertown was built in 1845 following the donation of a plot of land by resident John Rentzheimer. Prior to this all schooling was performed on a rotation basis in local homes.
In the late 1840s, the town would shift from a small farming community to a burgeoning industrial center, with coal yards being built in 1848, and the Lower Saucon Ironworks opening in 1849. This growth was expedited in 1856 the North Pennsylvania Railroad was built through Hellertown and Rudolphus Kent, of Gwynedd, purchased a plot of land to build a rail station. The small wooden station would be demolished in favor of a larger stone one in 1868. In 1858, the town's first newspaper, The Hellertown Telegraph began publication, but would only last a year before shutting its doors. In 1866, a large iron foundry was constructed by the Lower Saucon Ironworks. It was joined by the Saucon Savings bank in 1871, and a steel foundry in 1872. A Planing mill was built in 1874 and a furniture factory and flour mill in 1875. 
In 1870, the original school house built in 1845 was purchased and turned into an Evangelical Church, the first church in the town, prior to which all religious services where held on a rotational basis in people's houses. Since 1867, the town has had an Odd Fellows lodge, and they were joined in October 1869 by the second ever chapter of the Sons of Hermann. 
In 1874, the first cemetery in the town was started, the Union Cemetery. In 1875, the town's second newspaper, The Saucon Advertiser was founded, but it would close in just a few months. That year Hellertown consisted of five stores, two hardware stores, one drug store, two carriage factories, one foundry, one grist-mill, one saw-mill, one planing-mill, two furnace stacks, three hotels, coal and lumber yard, furniture manufactory, a town hall, a bank, two churches, and a population of almost 1,000.
