The legislation went into effect in May 2023.

She developed this guidebook with strong support from local unions, who have been active partners in her work to expand opportunities in the skilled trades. The guidebook includes information on local apprenticeship programs, deadlines, and other essential information.
In June 2021, Gilmore Richardson passed the workforce development and career pathways information sheet bill requiring employers to provide an information sheet, created and updated by the Department of Labor, to workers either at the start of employment for gig economy workers or at the point of separation for all other workers. Gilmore Richardson Said "This legislation will help more Philadelphians move into family supporting and sustaining careers by providing them with information about job training and educational opportunities when they may need it most."


==== Fiscal Responsibility ====
In June 2020, Gilmore Richardson introduced a bill to require public hearings prior to adopting labor contracts, including the agreement with Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5. This legislation was passed by City Council in September 2020. In October the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5 sued the city over the legislation, and Gilmore Richardson said the measure creates "transparency and accountability" for the police.
In May 2022, Gilmore Richardson passed legislation to account for the City of Philadelphia's estimated $6 million in Unclaimed property. The bill requires the Director of Finance to submit an annual report to City Council and the City Controller of all unclaimed property owed to the city, a status update regarding claims in process, and the total amount of revenue returned to the City of Philadelphia. In November 2022, the city received $6,035,842.55 in unclaimed property funds due to the city.
In February 2023, Gilmore Richardson passed legislation amending The Philadelphia Home Rule Charter to change the requirements for contributions of the Budget Stabilization Reserve. The legislation was voted into effect during the 2023 Philadelphia Primary Election.


==== Education ====
In February 2021 at a rally with the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers against the premature resumption of in-person learning, Gilmore Richardson said "As a former teacher, as a mother, and a councilmember, I'm angry. We should not have teachers in this position. Ever." She called for a vaccination plan for teachers and stated, "As we near the one-year anniversary of the pandemic, getting children back into classrooms throughout the city is vitally important to their future."
In April 2021, Gilmore Richardson released a report recommending for conflict resolution training to be offered to all School District of Philadelphia students as part of a larger strategy to reduce gun violence and the number of conflicts amongst young people. The School District of Philadelphia announced that they would offer trauma-informed, evidence-based conflict resolution training at the Tier 1 level that is culturally competent and developed in collaboration with school staff and teachers next school year.


==== Tangled Titles ====
Inspired by her personal challenges with the tangled title of her childhood home, In September 2021, Gilmore Richardson introduced legislation to help prevent tangled titles in Philadelphia. The Tangled Title Disclosure Bill requires funeral homes to share information, provided in partnership by the Department of Records and Register of Wills, about probating estates and avoiding tangled titles when they provide a death certificate. The bill went into effect in August 2022.
Her advocacy inspired investigative reporting on how tangled titles impact Black generational wealth in other cities such as St. Louis.


==== Public Safety ====
In June 2021, Gilmore Richardson passed legislation to reform Philadelphia's minor curfew law. The curfew reform bill simplified the curfew by making the times easier to understand.

She also worked closely with the Administration to establish Community Evening Resource Centers (CERC), safe spaces for minors who violate curfew and young people seeking support, mentorship, programming and recreational activities. As of June 2023, there are six CERC's located in each police division across the city.
