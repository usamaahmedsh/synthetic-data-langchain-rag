=== Early career ===
DeFoor began his career in 1986 as an investigator for the Dauphin County public defender's office. He subsequently worked as an investigator for Pennsylvania's office of the Inspector General and the Pennsylvania attorney general. He has also worked as an internal auditor and fraud investigator for UPMC Health Plan, and as a consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton.


=== County controller ===
DeFoor won election to the office of Dauphin County controller in 2015, defeating Democratic nominee Eric Gutshall. He was the first African American to win election to a county row office in Dauphin County. During his first term as controller, DeFoor's work won recognition from the Government Finance Officers Association. DeFoor won re-election in 2019, running unopposed. After being elected auditor general, DeFoor submitted his resignation as county controller on December 21, 2020, to take effect on the morning of January 19, 2021. Mary Bateman was elected on November 2, 2021, to succeed him as controller.


=== Auditor General ===
DeFoor announced his intent to run in the 2020 Pennsylvania Auditor General election on December 19, 2019. DeFoor was endorsed by the Pennsylvania Republican Party in January 2020, leading one of his Republican primary opponents, Dennis Stuckey, to withdraw from the race. The other remaining Republican in the field, Cris Dush, later withdrew to seek a seat in the Pennsylvania State Senate, leaving DeFoor as the sole candidate in the Republican primary. In the general election, DeFoor was pitted against Nina Ahmad, a progressive activist and former deputy mayor of Philadelphia. On November 6, 2020, the Associated Press called the race for DeFoor.
DeFoor took office as auditor general on January 19, 2021, succeeding Democrat Eugene DePasquale. In his inaugural address, DeFoor paid tribute to figures such as John Lewis, who he credited with paving the way for himself to enter politics, and pledged to "look at every issue through a non-partisan lens." He further pledged to maintain members of DePasquale's staff who he felt were capable. He stated that one of his priorities as auditor general would be to complete an audit of governor Tom Wolf's COVID-19 business waiver program.
