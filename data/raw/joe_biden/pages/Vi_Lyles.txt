=== Economic expansion ===
Mayor Lyles entered office in 2015 with Charlotte's unemployment averaging 5.30%. Lyles aided the creation of more than 27,000 new jobs by securing Charlotte as the location for expansion by Honeywell, Lowes, and Microsoft. This combined with the development of homegrown businesses, such as LendingTree and Avid Exchange, led to an influx of employment opportunities. As more jobs became available in Charlotte, the unemployment rate average decreased: 4.85% (2016), 4.38% (2017), 3.88% (2018), 3.68% (2019), 7.76% (2020), 4.67% (2021), and 3.76% (2022 Jan-Aug).

=== Housing ===
In April 2018, Lyles sought the expansion of the Housing Trust Fund, which promotes the construction of public housing for low-income renters through subsidies.


=== Public safety ===
In 2021, Mayor Lyles and the city of Charlotte implemented a program called Alternatives to Violence in Charlotte to curb violent crimes and shootings. The program was first used in the Mecklenburg County area before expanding to the Beatties Ford and LaSalle county areas.
In September 2025, Lyles stated that the killing of Iryna Zarutska was caused in part by the failure of the justice system that allowed the perpetrator to re-enter society despite his mental illness and violent behavior. On September 9, 2025, she said in the statement: "We need a bipartisan solution to address repeat offenders who do not face consequences for their actions and those who cannot get treatment for their mental illness and are allowed to be on the streets."


=== Race equity ===
On November 1, 2021, Mayor Lyles launched the Racial Equity Initiative that would invest $250 million to “address inequities and remove barriers to opportunity through four priority focus areas…” The project used those funds to build a new Center for Digital Equity, invest in Charlotte's six corridors of opportunity neighborhoods, turn Johnson C. Smith University into a top HBCU, and ensure commitment from organizations to advance black leaders and leaders of color throughout their corporations.


=== Transportation ===
One of the areas of policy that Mayor Vi Lyles focuses her efforts on is the expansion of Charlotte because it is one of the fastest-growing cities in the nation. To connect the different areas of the city, Lyles alongside the Charlotte Area Transit System, opened a 19-mile light rail transit line. The railway that opened in Lyles’ first term, was expected to reduce traffic accidents and increase urban mobility and accessibility. Additionally, Lyles implemented a Vision Zero philosophy with the intention to further decrease traffic fatalities.
