The northwestern section is rugged and mountainous, part of the New Jersey Highlands.

Passaic County operates through six standing committees of the Board of County Commissioners. They are: Administration & Finance; Health, Education and Community Affairs; Public Works and Buildings & Grounds; Law & Public Safety; Human Services and Planning and Economic Development.

Ciambrone, Michael Marrotta, and Edward O'Connell were defeated. In March 2023, the commission swore Orlando Cruz, the president of the Greater Paterson Chamber of Commerce (as well as its counterpart in neighboring Wayne), into office to replace retiring commissioner T.J.

== Politics ==

Passaic County was historically a swing county, as it voted for the national winner all but twice (in 1976 and 1992) between 1920 and 1992. Since 1996, the county has leaned Democratic until recently, as Republicans have made significant gains in the country, especially in the more urban parts. In the 2016 presidential election, Democratic support declined to 59.5%, although nominee Hillary Clinton still won the county comfortably overall, and the 2020 presidential election saw Democratic support decline to 57.5% - a margin of 16.5% for former Vice President Joe Biden over Republican President Donald Trump, which was a slightly wider margin than the state as a whole. Passaic County's namesake municipality, the small city of Passaic, saw the biggest overall drop for Biden compared to Clinton among its municipalities, which helped Trump narrow the gap in the county overall in 2020 compared to 2016. This outcome was in correspondence with the rightward trend of the county in recent years, which was also seen in the 2021 gubernatorial election. Democratic governor Phil Murphy won the county by just a 4% margin, while winning statewide by 3.2%. This was far below his 22% margin in 2017, when he won statewide by 14%.
In the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump flipped the county Republican, and most notably, its cities of Passaic and Clifton. The county voted to the right of the state, which voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by 6%. Trump became the first Republican to win a presidential election in the county since George H.W. Bush in the 1992 presidential election. Democrat Andy Kim won the county by just 3% in the concurrent 2024 U.S. Senate election in New Jersey, even as he won statewide by 10%. A year later, Passaic County flipped blue in the 2025 gubernatorial election, where Mikie Sherrill won the county by 16% over Jack Ciattarelli, voting to the left of the state.
As of August 1, 2020, there were a total of 318,029 registered voters in Passaic County, of which 128,114 (40.3%) were registered as Democrats, 64,389 (20.3%) were registered as Republicans and 120,282 (37.8%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There were 5,244 (1.7%) voters registered to other parties. Among the county's 2010 Census population, 53.2% were registered to vote, including 70.8% of those ages 18 and over.
