A member of the United States Foreign Service, she previously served as the United States ambassador to Slovakia from 2019 until 2022 and has held various positions in the State Department since 1996.
In April 2022, she was nominated by President Joe Biden to be the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and presented her credentials to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in May 2022. Brink served in her post during the first three years of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, signaling support for Ukraine in the conflict and advocating for the U.S. to provide military aid. She resigned during President Donald Trump's second term over disagreements with his administration's shift towards Russia and away from Ukraine. In June 2025, she announced her campaign for Congress in the 2026 election in Michigan's 7th congressional district. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

== Career ==
After joining the United States Department of State in 1996, Brink served as a consular political officer in the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade from 1997 to 1999. She then served as a Cyprus desk officer until 2002, and as a special assistant for Europe to the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs until 2004. From 2005 to 2008, Brink served as political-economic chief in Tbilisi.
From 2008 to 2009, Brink served as the deputy director for southern European affairs at the U.S. Department of State. She then joined the United States National Security Council and from 2009 to 2010, she served as director for the Aegean and South Caucasus, where she helped coordinate U.S. foreign policy and advance U.S. interests with Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. In 2011, Brink returned to Georgia as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi.
Brink served as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan from 2014 until August 2015, when she became deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. In 2018, Foreign Policy reported that Brink was slated to be nominated as the US ambassador to Georgia, but the Georgian Dream government rebuffed her due to her alleged predisposition toward former Georgian President and then-opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili.


=== U.S. ambassador to Slovakia ===
President Donald Trump nominated Brink to become the ambassador to Slovakia. Hearings were held before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 16, 2019. The committee favorably reported her nomination to the Senate floor on May 22, 2019. Brink was confirmed by the entire Senate via voice vote on May 23, 2019.
Brink presented her credentials to President Zuzana Čaputová on August 20, 2019.


=== U.S. ambassador to Ukraine ===

In February 2022, it was reported that President Joe Biden would nominate Brink as the United States ambassador to Ukraine. On April 25, 2022, Brink was nominated to serve in that position. Hearings took place on May 10, 2022, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. On May 18, 2022, the committee reported her favorably to the Senate floor. Her nomination process was fast-tracked and she was unanimously confirmed by the entire Senate via voice vote later that day. She presented her credentials on May 30, 2022, and took office during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
Brink has supported Ukraine throughout the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On July 22, 2022, Brink stated that the United States would continue to "support Ukraine for as long as it takes". She made these statements after the White House announced they would send $270 million for military assistance to Ukraine. On July 26, she met with Jonathan Markovitch, the Chief Rabbi of Kyiv. In December, it was reported that she had met with President Zelensky in person to securely coordinate his 9.5 hour visit to Washington, D.C., on December 23, 2022. In April 2025, Brink made a social media post about a recent missile strike on Kryvyi Rih. Afterward, Brink received a sharp rebuke from Zelensky for omitting Russia's role in the strike.
Brink announced her intention to step down as ambassador on April 10, 2025, effective on April 21. She reportedly chose to resign due to disagreements with the Trump administration, pressure from President Zelenskyy, and the toll of working in a war zone away from her family for nearly three years. Brink's resignation was seen as another upheaval amidst the State Department's reorientation away from Ukraine and towards Russia.


=== 2026 congressional campaign ===

On June 18, 2025, Brink announced that she would run in the Democratic primary for the U.S. House of Representatives in Michigan's 7th congressional district, with the goal of challenging Republican incumbent Tom Barrett in 2026.
