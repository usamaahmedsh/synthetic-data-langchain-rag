== Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ==
On February 19, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Brooks-LaSure to be the next administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The United States Senate Committee on Finance held hearings on her nomination on April 15, 2021. 
On April 22, 2021, the committee deadlocked on her nomination in a party-line vote, which resulted in an additional discharge vote being needed for her nomination to appear before the full Senate for a confirmation vote. 
On May 12, 2021, her nomination was discharged from the committee by a vote of 51–48. On May 25, 2021, Brooks-LaSure was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 55–44.  On May 27, 2021, she was sworn in by Secretary Xavier Becerra.


== CMS vs. FDA Alzheimer Controversy ==
On April 7, 2022, CMS restricted anti-amyloid Alzheimer immunotherapies, approved by the Food and Drug Administration, to “coverage with evidence development.” CMS never before required registry studies for FDA-approved drug coverage and the decision resulted in no coverage for the class of medications. The restriction meant that over 2,000 patients with Alzheimer's per day progressed from mild to more severe disease, thus outside appropriate use.  On July 6, 2023 (455 days later and 910,000 progressed patients), with the FDA approval of a second anti-amyloid therapy, CMS covered a drug in this class with a registry requirement.
