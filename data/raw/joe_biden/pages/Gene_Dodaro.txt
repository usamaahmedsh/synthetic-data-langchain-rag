Eugene Louis Dodaro (born May 7, 1951) is the comptroller general of the United States and head of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). From October 1, 2000, until March 12, 2008, he was the chief operating officer (COO) of the GAO and he held the equivalent second-in-command title before the late 2000 restructuring of the GAO, principal assistant comptroller general, a title he had held since May 1999. This change of titles is a result of the organization-wide restructuring rather than a promotion or other event in his career; from May 1999 through to March 12, 2008, Dodaro retained the position of second in command of the GAO.

Walker, announced that he was departing from his office before the end of his 15-year term to work for the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, he appointed Dodaro to replace him. On March 13, 2008, Dodaro became the acting comptroller general and was eventually nominated by President Obama to fill the role permanently.
