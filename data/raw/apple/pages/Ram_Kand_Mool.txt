Ram Kand Mool is a drum-shaped tuber mainly found in Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra. It is a lesser-known variety of tuber and root-fruit. Even though its identity is mysterious, it is believed to be the flowering stalk of Century plant (Agave Sisalana or Sisal) via research. It is believed in Hinduism that Lord Rama consumed this root-fruit when he was in exile for 14 years.


== History ==


=== Mythological Significance ===
According to Hindu historical texts, Ram Kand Mool was consumed by Lord Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother Lakshmana during their exile in the forest.


=== Research ===
In the 1980s, the Indian botanists unsuccessfully tried to find more information on Ram Kand Mool. Later in 1994, the Shivaji University, Kolhapur resorted to DNA fingerprinting to identify the Ram Kand Mool plant and concluded that it is a variety of Agave americana. The anatomical study showed the plant is a typical monocotyledonous vascular bundle arrangement. However, this added more confusion, as monocots have adventitious roots and not a tap root system.
Hence, to find out the source, the plant material was obtained from a vendor from Jyotiba Temple in Kolhapur district, Maharashtra. The slices of approximately 4.5 inches radius and 2–3 mm breadth were brought to the laboratory and DNA was extracted from slices of Ram Kand Mool. Its purity was searched on agarose gel. The plastid locus for maturase k was selected to identify the plant species. The similarity search revealed 89 per cent identity with the partial sequence of the plastid locus maturase of Agave sisalana.


== Consumption ==

It can be found during summer. It is served as thinly cut slices as a street snack, wrapped in leaves or papers, and eaten raw. It is seasoned with honey, palm sugar, lime, salt and chilli powder. Vendors selling Ram Kand Mool usually claim that consuming it can cool your stomach and satisfy your thirst. Ram Kand Mool is a starch-rich tuber. Some people consume Ram Kand Mool in powdered form as part of traditional medicines.
