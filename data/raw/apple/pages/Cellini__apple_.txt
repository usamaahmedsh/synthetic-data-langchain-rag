'Cellini' is an apple cultivar that was selected from a seed of a tree referred to as 'Nonsuch', though that name is ambiguous. It was introduced in about 1828 by Leonard Phillips, who operated a nursery at Vauxhall, London. It is a soft-textured cooking apple, juicy and coarse-textured. This cultivar is a parent of several other successful apple cultivars.
