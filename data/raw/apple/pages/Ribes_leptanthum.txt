Historically the berries of R. leptanthum have been consumed in Native American cultures in a variety of ways: they are readily eaten fresh by Apache peoples, including the Chiricahua, Mescalero, and other peoples (specifically those in the vicinity of Isleta and Jemez in New Mexico); used as an ingredient in cakes made for overwintering by Chiricahua, and Mescalero peoples; and, in those communities where early-settling Spanish and Native American cultures have generally mingled or influenced each other, R. leptanthum  berries are used in recipes for jellies and wines.
