It is endemic to California, where it is known from several areas in the west-central part of the state, such as the Santa Monica Mountains and lower San Joaquin Valley.

Layia heterotricha is an annual herb producing a thick, erect stem to a maximum height near 90 centimeters. The stem and foliage are covered thinly in dark glandular hairs and the plant has a scent similar to apples or bananas. The leaves are oval-shaped, fleshy, and sometimes slightly toothed.
