== Description ==
Ginataang hipon is one of the simpler types of ginataan. The basic recipe includes unshelled shrimp with the heads intact, coconut milk, onion, garlic, ginger/turmeric, patis (fish sauce) or bagoong alamang (shrimp paste), and salt and pepper to taste. It can also be spiced with siling haba or labuyo peppers. The onion and garlic are first sautéed in oil in a pan, followed by the shrimp, then the rest of the ingredients are added until cooked. Some recipes prefer to boil the coconut milk until it is reduced and oily, while others keep the dish soupy. Coconut cream is also preferred if available, instead of thin coconut milk. The dish does not normally include any type of vegetables. Some versions, however, add leafy vegetables, bamboo shoots (labong), tomatoes, and/or cucumber.


== Variants ==

Variants of the ginataang hipon (ginataang shrimp) include the ginataang curacha (which use spanner crabs), ginataang sugpo (which use prawns/lobsters) and ginataang ampalaya. 
A notable variant of ginataang curacha is curacha Alavar.
