Prunus veitchii, synonym Prunus xueluoensis, is a species of Prunus found in south-central and southeast China. It is a shrubby tree 0.5 to 3 m tall, preferring to grow at 1100 to 1500 m above sea level. It is morphologically similar to Prunus tomentosa and Prunus tianshanica. It differs from them by a number of features including having two to four flowers per inflorescence, many more stamens per flower, a glabrous pistil and a black fruit. Genetically, P. veitchii (discussed under the synonym P. xueluoensis) is more closely related to P. polytricha, P. jingningensis, and P. pseudocerasus.
