== History ==
The village now has very strict building ordinances to preserve its "pristine rural charm", including prohibitions on sidewalks, fences, and residential street lights.  The Long Grove area is now known for its historic downtown, its exclusive million dollar homes and the annual events including the chocolate, strawberry and apple festivals that take place in May, June and September, respectively. The Robert Parker Coffin Bridge, on the edge of the city's downtown, is a historic 1906 bridge that is featured on the Long Grove's logo and welcome signs. Due to the 8-foot-6-inch (2.59 m) clearance height of its covering, it has been struck by vehicles dozens of times in recent years.
