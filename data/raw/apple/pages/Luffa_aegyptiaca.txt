Luffa aegyptiaca, the sponge gourd, Egyptian cucumber or Vietnamese luffa,  is an annual species of vine cultivated for its fruit, native to South and Southeast Asia.


== Description ==
The three-lobed leaves are 7.5–20 centimetres (3–8 inches) wide.
The fruit, approximately 30 cm (12 in) long and maturing to brown, resembles a cucumber in shape and size.


== History ==


=== Etymology ===
The synonymous botanical specific epithet "aegyptiaca" was given to this plant in the 16th century when European botanists were introduced to the plant from its cultivation in Egypt. In the European botanical literature, the plant was first described by Johann Veslingius in 1638, who named it "Egyptian cucumber". Veslingius also introduced the name "Luffa".

== Uses ==


=== Culinary ===
The young fruit is eaten as a vegetable and is commonly grown for that purpose in tropical Asia. The young shoots, flowers and leaves can be cooked, and the mature seeds can be roasted for consumption.


=== Sponge ===
Unlike the young fruit, the fully ripened fruit is strongly fibrous and inedible, and is used to make scrubbing bath sponges. Due to the use as a scrubbing sponge, it is also known by the common names dishrag gourd, rag gourd, sponge gourd, and vegetable-sponge. It is also called smooth luffa to distinguish it from the ridged luffa (Luffa acutangula), which is used for the same purposes.


=== Oil extract ===
An edible oil can be extracted from the seeds. The resulting oil meal can be fed to rabbits and catfish, or used as a fertilizer.


=== Art ===
In the Levant, Luffa aegyptiaca has been in use since late antiquity. Young fruits were used for food. Mature fruits were used as bath sponges. Roman mosaics featuring Luffa aegyptiaca fruits have been discovered in churches and synagogues throughout Israel and Israeli-occupied territories.


== Cultivation ==
Luffa has been cultivated throughout Asia for centuries for use as a household cleaning agent and is now, due to the gently abrasive quality of the natural fibers, a popular exfoliating agent in the eco-friendly cosmetic industry. Owing to its striking yellow flowers, the plant is occasionally grown as an ornamental.


=== Climate ===
It requires much heat and a lot of water to thrive.
However, Luffa aegyptiaca can be cultivated in temperate climates. Research from North Carolina suggests that commercial production of luffa in the United States could be economically viable.


=== Growth ===
Techniques that contribute to success in growing luffa include using black mulch to warm soil temperatures and transplants to increase the germination rate and extend the growing season. Narrow spacing may result in poorer quality sponges. It is best grown with a trellis support for its curled tendrils to hang on to.
