Ralls Janet is an apple cultivar that is also known by many other names. It has been used extensively in modern apple breeding, and has several commercially important offspring, notably the Fuji. It was grown at Monticello by Thomas Jefferson. 
It has been said that the name derives from Edmond-Charles Genet, a Frenchman who gave cuttings to Jefferson, who then passed them on to Virginia nurseryman Caleb Ralls, but this claim, cited here from 1905, was not made until about 100 years after the apple became known and may not be accurate.
In 1871, Dr. William Howsley reported that Caleb Rawles  [sic] introduced the variety in 1795 as the Genet Apple.
