Crimson Delight is an apple cultivar and is a cross of a Splendour with a Gala. In February 2016 Washington State University relaunched the apple variety with the name Sunrise Magic. The apple is also known as WA 2. 
The Crimson Delight tree has a compact growth habit and is highly productive.  The fruit is not prone to sunburn or bitter pit and is harvested in the fall around late September to October.  Post-harvest the fruit is not sensitive to bruising and is easy to handle on packing lines.  The apple stores exceptionally well and can last 6 months in refrigerated storage and 12 months in controlled atmosphere storage.  Flavor peaks as it is stored and ripens further if set out on a counter for a few days to a week.
Crimson Delight is a multi-purpose apple intended for snacking, baking and fresh recipes.  The fruit size is medium to large with a firm texture and is crisp and juicy.  The skin is an orange red to pinkish blush over a limited yellow background.
