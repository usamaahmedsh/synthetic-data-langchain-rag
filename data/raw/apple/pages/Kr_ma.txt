Kréma is a French brand of confectionery, owned by Eurazeo.


== History ==
Kréma was best known in the period from 1950 to 1970, particularly under the Mint'Ho brand of caramel white mints. Alternative Bat'na combines white and brown caramel, while Regliss' combines white and black licorice.
The Mint'ho was characterized by the fact that, alone of all the sweets made at this time, it floated on water. This was due to the expansion of micro-air bubbles that made it easy to chew. Since the manufacturing process has changed over time, the mints no longer float. Mint'ho is prohibited by some religions, including Judaism, because it contains animal gelatin and emulsifiers.


== Flavours ==
Kréma is available in various flavours, including cherry, lemon, raspberry, orange, caramel, pomegranate, iced tea, peach and apple.
