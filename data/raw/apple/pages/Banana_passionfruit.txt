== Invasive species ==
P. tarminiana and P. tripartita thrive in the climate of New Zealand. They are invasive species since they can smother forest margins and forest regrowth. It is illegal to sell, cultivate, or distribute the plants.
As of 2011, banana passionfruit vines are smothering more than 200 square miles (520 km2) of native forest on the islands of Hawaii and Kauai. Seeds are spread by feral pigs, birds and humans.  The vine can also be found all across the highlands of New Guinea and in Tasmania.
