Žemlovka, žemľovka or Scheiterhaufen (in common language: zemlbába) is a sweet bread pudding made of apples and rohlíks or veka, soaked in sweet milk.
Another variant uses pears instead of apples. The meal is a traditional part of Czech and Slovak cuisine and often appears in canteens.


== Classic Preparation ==
Rohlíks or veka are sliced and immersed in milk that is flavoured with sugar, vanilla sugar, and ground cinnamon. A layer of wet pastry is put in the bottom of a roaster; a layer of fruit is spread on top. Several layers are stacked; the top layer is always pastry.
The fruit layer is sprinkled with sugar, ground cinnamon and/or raisins. The mixture is baked until a golden crust forms on the top.
Žemlovka can be eaten both warm and cold.
