The Beurré Bosc or Bosc is a cultivar of the European pear (Pyrus communis), originally from France or Belgium. Also known as the Kaiser, it is grown in Europe; Australia; Argentina; the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario in Canada, and the  states of California, Washington, and Oregon in the United States.
The Beurré Bosc was cultivated first in Belgium or France. The name Bosc is given after a French horticulturist named Louis Bosc, and "Beurré" means "buttery," referring to the fruit's soft, juicy texture.
Characteristic features are a long tapering neck and russet skin. Famous for its warm cinnamon color, the Bosc nicknamed the "aristocrat of pears" and is often used in drawings, paintings, and photography due to its shape. Its white flesh is denser, crisper and smoother than that of the 'Williams or D'Anjou pear. It is suitable for poaching.
