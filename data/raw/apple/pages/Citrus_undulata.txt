== Taxonomy ==
Originally characterized and named as Citrus undulata by André Guillaumin in 1938, this species along with the other false oranges were moved to a novel genus, Oxanthera, in the Swingle and Tanaka systems of citrus taxonomy. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Oxanthera species clustered within Citrus, which makes this species a member of that genus.
