Prunus discoidea is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to southeastern China. A member of the cherry subgenus Cerasus, it is a tree reaching 2.5 to 3.5 m (8 to 11 ft). It is typically found in near streams in valleys and ravines, typically in forests or thickets, at elevations from 200 to 1,100 m (700 to 3,600 ft) above sea level. Two cultivars with attractive blossoms have been derived from wild specimens; 'Yuanchun' and 'Caiyun'.
