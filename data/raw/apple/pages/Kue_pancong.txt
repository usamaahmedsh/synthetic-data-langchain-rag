Kue pancong is an Indonesian kue or traditional snack made of a rice flour and coconut-based batter and cooked in a special mold pan. It is a commonly found snack in traditional Indonesian markets. The mold pan is similar to a muffin tin but has rectangular basins instead of rounded ones. It consists of a row of rectangular basins of small tubs with rounded half-moon bottoms, to create half-moon or boat-shaped hot cakes. A pancong mold is quite similar to a waffle mold. The special grill-like metal mold used in making kue pancong is also used in other Indonesian traditional kue, including kue pukis and kue rangi, and so the shape is quite similar to those cakes. Kue pancong is often regarded as the coconut version of wheat-based kue pukis. The texture is chewy and soft, similar to pancake.
