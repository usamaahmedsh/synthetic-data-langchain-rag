== Medicinal use ==
The Aztecs called this plant the Tlacoxiloxochitl, and used it to aid in coughs. From An Aztec Herbal: "If one is troubled by a cough, let him forthwith sip the boiled liquor of the tlaco-xilo-xochitl root skinned and ground up in water; using a part of this, with honey, to anoint the throat. If he spits blood also, let him take the same liquor as a drink before meals. It would help if he gnawed and chewed some of the said root, with honey. The root of the herb called tzopelica-cococ, ground in tepid water is also of value for one with a cough; let him either drink the liquor or gnaw the root."
