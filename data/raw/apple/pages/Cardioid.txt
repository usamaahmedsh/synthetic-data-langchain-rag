In geometry, a cardioid (from Greek  καρδιά (kardiá) 'heart') is a plane curve traced by a point on the perimeter of a circle that is rolling around a fixed circle of the same radius. It can also be defined as an epicycloid having a single cusp. It is also a type of sinusoidal spiral, and an inverse curve of the parabola with the focus as the center of inversion. A cardioid can also be defined as the set of points of reflections of a fixed point on a circle through all tangents to the circle.

Giovanni Salvemini coined the name cardioid in 1741, but the cardioid had been the subject of study decades beforehand. Although named for its resemblance to a conventional  heart-like form, it is shaped more like the outline of the cross-section of a round apple without the stalk.
A cardioid microphone exhibits an acoustic pickup pattern that, when graphed in two dimensions, resembles a cardioid (any 2d plane containing the 3d straight line of the microphone body). In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centred around the microphone which is the "stalk" of the apple.

=== Proof for the parametric representation ===
A proof can be established using complex numbers and their common description as the complex plane. The rolling movement of the black circle on the blue one can be split into two rotations. In the complex plane a rotation around point 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
  
 (the origin) by an angle 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
  
 can be performed by multiplying a point 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  
 (complex number) by

=== Cardioid as inverse curve of a parabola ===

A cardioid is the inverse curve of a parabola with its focus at the center of inversion (see graph)
For the example shown in the graph the generator circles have radius 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle a={\frac {1}{2}}}
  
. Hence the cardioid has the polar representation

  
    
      
        r
        (
        φ
        )
        =
        1
        −
        cos
        ⁡
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle r(\varphi )=1-\cos \varphi }
  

and its inverse curve

  
    
      
        r
        (
        φ
        )
        =
        
          
            1
            
              1
              −
              cos
              ⁡
              φ
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r(\varphi )={\frac {1}{1-\cos \varphi }},}
  

which is a parabola (s. parabola in polar coordinates) with the equation 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          
            
              1
              2
            
          
        
        
          (
          
            
              y
              
                2
              
            
            −
            1
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\textstyle x={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(y^{2}-1\right)}
  
 in Cartesian coordinates.
Remark: Not every inverse curve of a parabola is a cardioid. For example, if a parabola is inverted across a circle whose center lies at the vertex of the parabola, then the result is a cissoid of Diocles.


=== Cardioid as envelope of a pencil of circles ===

In the previous section if one inverts additionally the tangents of the parabola one gets a pencil of circles through the center of inversion (origin). A detailed consideration shows: The midpoints of the circles lie on the perimeter of the fixed generator circle. (The generator circle is the inverse curve of the parabola's directrix.)
This property gives rise to the following simple method to draw a cardioid:

Choose a circle 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  
 and a point 
  
    
      
        O
      
    
    {\displaystyle O}
  
 on its perimeter,
draw circles containing 
  
    
      
        O
      
    
    {\displaystyle O}
  
 with centers on 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  
, and
draw the envelope of these circles.


=== Cardioid as envelope of a pencil of lines ===

A similar and simple method to draw a cardioid uses a pencil of lines. It is due to L. Cremona:

Draw a circle, divide its perimeter into equal spaced parts with 
  
    
      
        2
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2N}
  
 points (s. picture) and number them consecutively.
Draw the chords: 
  
    
      
        (
        1
        ,
        2
        )
        ,
        (
        2
        ,
        4
        )
        ,
        …
        ,
        (
        n
        ,
        2
        n
        )
        ,
        …
        ,
        (
        N
        ,
        2
        N
        )
        ,
        (
        N
        +
        1
        ,
        2
        )
        ,
        (
        N
        +
        2
        ,
        4
        )
        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle (1,2),(2,4),\dots ,(n,2n),\dots ,(N,2N),(N+1,2),(N+2,4),\dots }
  
. (That is, the second point is moved by double velocity.)
The envelope of these chords is a cardioid.

The cardioid is the envelope of the chords of a circle.

=== Cardioid as caustic of a circle ===
The considerations made in the previous section give a proof that the caustic of a circle with light source on the perimeter of the circle is a cardioid.

If in the plane there is a light source at a point 
  
    
      
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z}
  
 on the perimeter of a circle which is reflecting any ray, then the reflected rays within the circle are tangents of a cardioid.

Remark: For such considerations usually multiple reflections at the circle are neglected.


=== Cardioid as pedal curve of a circle ===

The Cremona generation of a cardioid should not be confused with the following generation:
Let be 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  
 a circle and 
  
    
      
        O
      
    
    {\displaystyle O}
  
 a point on the perimeter of this circle. The following is true:

The foots of perpendiculars from point 
  
    
      
        O
      
    
    {\displaystyle O}
  
 on the tangents of circle 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  
 are points of a cardioid.
Hence a cardioid is a special pedal curve of a circle.

    {\displaystyle (x-2a)\cdot \cos \varphi +y\cdot \sin \varphi =2a\,.}
  

The foot of the perpendicular from point

 with the still unknown distance 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  
 to the origin 
  
    
      
        O

. Inserting the point into the equation of the tangent yields

which is the polar equation of a cardioid.
Remark: If point 
  
    
      
        O
      
    
    {\displaystyle O}
  
 is not on the perimeter of the circle 
  
    
      
        k

An orthogonal trajectory of a pencil of curves is a curve which intersects any curve of the pencil orthogonally. For cardioids the following is true:

(The second pencil can be considered as reflections at the y-axis of the first one. See diagram.)

That means: Any curve of the first pencil intersects any curve of the second pencil orthogonally.


== In different positions ==
Choosing other positions of the cardioid within the coordinate system results in different equations. The picture shows the 4 most common positions of a cardioid and their polar equations.


== In complex analysis ==

In complex analysis, the image of any circle through the origin under the map 
  
    
      
        z
        →
        
          z
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z\to z^{2}}
  
 is a cardioid. One application of this result is that the boundary of the central period-1 component of the Mandelbrot set is a cardioid given by the equation

  
    
      
        c
        
        =
        
        
          
            
              1
              −
              
                
                  (
                  
                    
                      e
                      
                        i
                        t
                      
                    
                    −
                    1
                  
                  )
                
                
                  2
                
              
            
            4
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\,=\,{\frac {1-\left(e^{it}-1\right)^{2}}{4}}.}
  

The Mandelbrot set contains an infinite number of slightly distorted copies of itself and the central bulb of any of these smaller copies is an approximate cardioid.


== Caustics ==
Certain caustics can take the shape of cardioids. The catacaustic of a circle with respect to a point on the circumference is a cardioid. Also, the catacaustic of a cone with respect to rays parallel to a generating line is a surface whose cross section is a cardioid. This can be seen, as in the photograph to the right, in a conical cup partially filled with liquid when a light is shining from a distance and at an angle equal to the angle of the cone. The shape of the curve at the bottom of a cylindrical cup is half of a nephroid, which looks quite similar.
