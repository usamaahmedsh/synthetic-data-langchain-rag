Malus sikkimensis is a rare species of apple known by the common name Sikkim crabapple. Its Chinese name is xi jin hai tang (锡金海棠).
It bears white and pink flowers and dark red fruit. It was first published in Gatt. Pomac. in 1890.
It is native to China, Nepal, Bhutan, Assam, Tibet and parts of India, where it is threatened due to loss of habitat.
The edible fruits are a primary source (within India and the Himalayas) of dietary dihydrochalcones and flavonoids (both organic compounds). An extract of the fruit has potential for protective and therapeutic properties.
