Stathmopoda is a genus of moths. It has variously been placed in its own family, Stathmopodidae, or in subfamily Stathmopodinae in the family Oecophoridae. Note that the phylogeny and systematics of gelechoid moths are still not fully resolved.


== Description ==
Stathmopoda have smooth heads with a metallic luster, and the occiput may be smooth or slightly coarse. The labial palps (part of the mouthparts) are curved, sharp-tipped and the second and third segments are similar in length. There is a pair of antennae which are shorter than the forewing, have elongate and clubbed scapes, and (in males) the flagella have long ciliae on the anterior margins.
Both forewings and hindwings are lanceolate, meaning they are widest near the base and taper to points at the end. The forewings are usually yellowish with dark brown markings. The tibiae of the hind legs have dense tufts.
Most of the abdominal tergites (2nd-7th of males, 2nd-6th of females) have spiniform (spine-like) setae along their posterior margins.
The male genitalia have a bell-shaped uncus that is setose laterally and tapering caudally, and is as long as the gnathos. The cucullus is densely setose on its inner margin. The female genitalia have the corpus bursae bearing a signum or a pair of signa. See Lepidoptera genitalia for definitions of these terms.


== Ecology ==
Larvae of Stathmopoda bore into seeds, fruits or buds of plants. 
Some are agricultural pests. For example, S. auriferella is a pest of fruits and vegetables including apples, avocados, grapes, jujubes, kiwifruit, peaches and pomegranates. Stathmopoda masinissa can cause serious damage to persimmons.
