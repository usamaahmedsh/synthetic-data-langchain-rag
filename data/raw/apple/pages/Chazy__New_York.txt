== Education ==
The census-designated place is within the Chazy Union Free School District. Chazy is home to Chazy Central Rural School and to the William H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute. Miner Institute's campus is also home to William Miner's preserved One Room Schoolhouse.
Chazy Central Rural School was opened on November 14, 1916, as a consolidation of eleven rural schools in the area. William H. Miner, a wealthy railroad industrialist, and philanthropist, donated $2,000,000 to build the school. It consisted of an elementary school program, a high school program, as well as departments of agriculture, industrial arts, household arts, library, drawing, music, and physical training. The children had access to expert medical and dental services free of charge. The old school was five stories high surrounding a bell tower of 71 feet (22 m) and contained two gymnasiums and two swimming pools, as well as an auditorium capable of seating 1,100 people. The school was deemed too costly to upgrade in the early 1960s. A modern two-story school building was built around it and opened in December 1968.
Chazy Central Rural School has four soccer fields which host youth, men's and women's leagues. The boys' varsity soccer team has won nine New York State Public High School Athletic Association state championships (2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2017, and 2018). Including 3 back-to-back championships (2004-2005, 2012-2013, and most recently 2017-2018). The girls' varsity soccer team has won three state championships, in 2007, 2010, and 2011. The school built its own soccer stadium, which opened in the fall of 2005 and is named after George Brendler, a former gym teacher and athletics coach at the school. The school's baseball and softball fields also host several youth leagues as well as a fireman's softball league. In 2011, the boys' varsity baseball team won its first sectional championship in school history. The school also has a large public playground and a pond.
