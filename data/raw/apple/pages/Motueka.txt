Motueka is a town in the South Island of New Zealand, close to the mouth of the Motueka River on the western shore of Tasman Bay. It is the second largest in the Tasman Region, with a population of 8,290 as of June 2025.
The surrounding district has a number of apple, pear, and kiwifruit orchards, as well as growing a variety of specialised crops such as hops. The area formerly served  as the main centre of tobacco growing in New Zealand until the early 1980s. A number of small vineyards have also been developed.
Nearby beaches (such as Kaiteriteri and Mārahau) are very popular with holidaymakers, and the area around Motueka has one of the country's highest annual sunshine-hour indices. Riwaka lies 4.8 km north of Motueka via State Highway 60 and Nelson is 41.7 km to the east of Motueka via State Highway 60 and State Highway 6.
Motueka, as one of the nearest towns to the Abel Tasman and Kahurangi National Parks, has become the base of many tourism ventures, as well as in Nelson Lakes National Park, and in other recreational areas. Extensive limestone cave systems (including Harwoods Hole in the Tākaka Hill area north of Motueka) attract cavers and rock climbers. Sea kayaking, tramping, and canyoning now attract many thousands of visitors each year.
Many artists live in the area around Motueka, especially potters and reggae musicians. The Riverside Community, in nearby Lower Moutere, is a pacifist intentional community. Founded in the 1940s, it is New Zealand's oldest cooperative living community.


== Name ==
The name Motueka, or more correctly Motuweka, comes from the  Māori language, and means weka island, the weka being a bird of the rail family. The town is colloquially called "Mot" by some residents.


== History ==

The first known European visitor to the coast near Motueka in 1827 was French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, of the French corvette Astrolabe. He explored and described much of the Tasman Bay shore line. Three ships carrying the New Zealand Company's Nelson expedition, led by Captain Arthur Wakefield, anchored at Astrolabe Roads, north of Kaiteriteri Beach—about 16 kilometres (10 mi) due north of Motueka—in October 1841. Kaiteriteri was selected as a site for the first settlement but was later abandoned in favour of Nelson Haven.
The exceptional fertility of the soil and the suitability of the surrounding land for small farm settlement were the main reasons for the establishment of the second town of the Nelson settlement at Motueka in 1842. There was trade between Nelson and Motueka in vegetables and timber in the 1840s. In 1850, Motueka had  "a church, various tradespeople, a general store, a doctor, a clergyman, a magistrate and a constable". Motueka was described as "the village was laid out in small sections in the middle of a splendid bush, and had some good open land all around on which the farms were situated”  in the 1850s. A significant flood hit Motueka in 1877 with the majority of buildings in the High Street being flooded.
During the period, 1853 to 1876, Motueka was administrated as part of the Nelson Province.
Motueka was created as a borough in 1900 with the first meeting of the Motueka Borough Council being held on 17 January 1900. The population at that time was  900 people with 182 ratepayers and 183 dwellings. The post office building was opened in 1902 by Sir Joseph Ward.

The Motueka war memorial was unveiled in 1922. It commemorates the 32 soldiers who died in WWI from the Motueka district. A plaque on the war memorial  was unveiled in 1957 to commemorate the 35 soldiers who died in WWII from the Motueka district.

== Economy ==

Horticulture is the main industry in the area surrounding Motueka, and the town benefits directly from this. Some of the main crops are apples, beer hops and kiwifruit. Sheep and cattle farming also  contribute to the local economy.
Due to the seasonal growth of many crops, the town's population increases greatly with seasonal workers, especially during late summer and early autumn for the apple 'pick'.
At the height of tobacco production, Motueka was home to two tobacco factories. One owned by Australian company WD & HO Wills Holdings and the other by Rothmans International.
