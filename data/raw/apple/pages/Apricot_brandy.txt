Apricot brandy can refer to a liquor (or Eau de Vie) distilled from fermented apricot juice or a liqueur made from apricot flesh and kernels. 
One method of production involves using a pound of loaf sugar for every pound of apricots, which should not yet be ripe. The apricots then need to be covered by water, boiled and then simmered so that their skins can be removed. The sugar then needs to be clarified and boiled, and poured over the fruit. This should be left for a day, before being bottled and filled with equal parts syrup and brandy. It should then be corked and left for twelve months before use.
It can be used as in ingredient in baking.
