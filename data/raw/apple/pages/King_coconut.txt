King coconut (Cocos nucifera var aurantiaca) is a  variety of coconut, native to Sri Lanka, where it is known as Thæmbili (Sinhala:  තැඹිලි) also found in India and Indonesia. It has less sugar content than other coconuts. There are several sub-varieties of the king coconut, the most common being the "red dwarf" (kaha thæmbili, commonly referred to as gon thæmbili). The other variety is "Ran Thæmbili", a smaller variety containing about forty nuts in a bunch. The king coconut tree is a shorter variety, and is commonly found growing wild in many areas of the country.
The king coconut water, the liquid endosperm of young coconuts, is a nutritious beverage rich in sugars (mainly reducing sugars), minerals (mainly K+), vitamins (mainly B & C) and amino acids. 
Sri Lanka now exports packaged king coconut water in a variety of brands.
