Mango sticky rice is a traditional Southeast Asian and South Asian dessert made with glutinous rice, fresh mango and coconut milk.


== Preparation ==
Desserts involving sticky rice are sweetened with palm sugar or jaggery combined with coconut milk and coconut flakes, wrapped in banana leaf, then steamed or stuffed in bamboo and roasted on an open fire such as sticky rice in bamboo. The main ingredients needed are sticky rice (glutinous rice), canned or fresh coconut milk, salt, palm sugar and mangoes.
To prepare the dish, the rice is soaked in water and then cooked by steaming or the use of a rice cooker. Meanwhile, the coconut milk is mixed with salt and sugar then heated without boiling. After the rice is finished cooking, the coconut milk mixture and the rice are mixed together evenly and allowed to sit to allow the milk to absorb into the rice. The mangoes are peeled and sliced. To serve the dish, the rice is scooped onto a plate, a few mango slices are placed on top or to the side, and the remaining coconut milk is drizzled on top. Sometimes, the sticky rice is topped with crispy yellow mung beans.
Typically, yellow mango is used which has a sweeter taste than green mango. Traditionally, the Nam Dok Mai (flower nectar mango) and ok-rong varieties of mango are used. Glutinous sticky rice, which is sweeter than normal sticky rice, is used for the best texture.

Khao niao mamuang (Thai: ข้าวเหนียวมะม่วง), which translates to mango sticky rice, is a traditional Thai dessert that typically consists of sticky rice cooked with coconut milk and served with fresh sliced mangoes on top. Optional toppings for mango sticky rice include roasted mung beans and toasted sesame seeds, which can be sprinkled on top for added crunch and flavor. In Central Thailand, coconut milk is a primary ingredient due to the abundance of coconut trees in these regions. However, in the colder Northern region, where it can be challenging to obtain fresh coconuts, the use of coconut milk is less common. Khao niao moon, a glutinous rice mixed with coconut milk, is commonly used in Central Thailand for desserts like mango sticky rice, while in Northern and Northeastern Thailand, plain sticky rice is more commonly used as a staple food and eaten with one's hands, without the addition of coconut.
