Eutypa lata is a fungal plant pathogen of grapevines. The fungus also attacks many other hosts such as cherry trees, most other Prunus species, as well as apples, pears and walnuts. In apricots, the fungus reveals a canker surrounding a pruning wound.
Eutypa lata was first found in Californian grapevines by English et al.1962, a few years after its discovery elsewhere. Travadon et al., 2011 finds that E. lata is an entirely or almost entirely sexual population here but asexual reproduction may be a rare occurrence.
It causes 'Eutypa dieback' in New Zealand grapevines as well.
The fungus was difficult to identify on the basis of colony morphology and could be out-competed by other fungi when isolated from wood. DNA isolated from one year old canes can be used instead.
