The California Dried Plum Festival, formerly the California Prune Festival, was an annual festival held in Yuba City, California, between 1988 and 2002.
Its September 2002, edition included a freestyle disc tournament organized by the Freestyle Players Association.
The name change in 2001 from California Prune Festival to California Dried Plum Festival provoked some amused comments from onlookers.
