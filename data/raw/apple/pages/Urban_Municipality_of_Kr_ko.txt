The Urban Municipality of Krško (pronounced [ˈkə́ɾʃkɔ] ; Slovene: Mestna občina Krško) is an urban municipality in eastern Slovenia. Its seat is the town of Krško. The area is traditionally divided between Lower Styria (territory on the left bank of the Sava) and Lower Carniola (territory on the right bank of the Sava). The entire municipality is now included in the Lower Sava Statistical Region. Krško received the status of an urban municipality in December 2021. It borders Croatia.


== History ==

Archaeological evidence shows that the area was settled in prehistoric times. Along the Sava River, numerous Bronze and Iron Age sites as well as Roman finds show continuous occupation. After the Medieval period the area was a Habsburg possession. It was affected by Ottoman raids from the 15th to the 17th centuries.


== Main sights ==
Sights in the municipality include the Krško parish church, the Videm-Krško parish church, a church on the right bank of the Sava, a Capuchin monastery, and Krško Castle. Further to the south is Šrajbarski Turn Castle, built in the 16th century. Natural sights in the municipality include Kostanjevica Cave at the foot of the Gorjanci Mountains and the Krakovo Forest, the only virgin forest in Slovenia where pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) grows and provides a habitat for several rare and endangered animal species.


== Economy ==
Industries of the Urban Municipality of Krško include construction, metalworking, paper, textiles, wood processing, agriculture, trade, and transportation, while tourism continues to develop. The fertile flatlands southeast of the town of Krško along the banks of the Sava, known as the Krško-Brežice Plain (Krško - brežiško polje), are used for vineyards as well as apple, pear, peach, apricot, and plum orchards. Local vineyards produce wines such as Cviček, Laški Rizling, and Modra Frankinja, as well as less well-known local wines such as white and red Sremičan and others matured in local wine cellars.
