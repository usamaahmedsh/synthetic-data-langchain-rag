Prunus phaeosticta, the dark-spotted cherry, is a species of plant native to China, Taiwan, and southeast Asia, including far eastern India, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. It gets its specific epithet and its common name from the small dark spots (glands) on the undersides of its leaves. Formosan rock macaques (Macaca cyclopis) eat the fruit.
