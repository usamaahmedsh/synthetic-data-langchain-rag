Dichlofluanid (N-dichlorofluoromethylthio-N′, N′-dimethyl-N-phenylsulfamide) is a fungicide used to protect strawberries, grapes, berries, apples, pears and other fruit, vegetables and ornamental plants from diseases such as apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), black spot, leather rot, gray mold, downy mildew and others caused by the fungi Botrytis, Alternaria, Sclerotinia, and Monilinia. It is also used to protect against diseases of fruit during storage, and as a wood preservative, often as part of a paint undercoat.
Dichlofluanid was first marketed by Bayer Company in 1964, for use as a fungicide on plants. Its trade names include Euparen and Elvaron.
