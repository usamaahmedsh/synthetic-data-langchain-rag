Kue talam is an Indonesian kue or traditional steamed snack made of a rice flour, coconut milk and other ingredients in a mold pan called talam which means "tray" in Indonesian. The cake mold used to create kue talam are either larger rectangular aluminium tray or smaller singular cups made from ceramics, aluminium, melamine or plastic.
Kue talam and its variations are commonly found in various Indonesian regional cuisine traditions; from Betawi, Minang, Malay, Batak, to Sundanese and Javanese. Kue talam was introduced by the Sino-Burmese to Lower Myanmar, where it is known as kway talan (ကွေတာလန်း).
Kue talam usually has two layers; the top one is white made from savoury creamy coconut milk, while the bottom one is coloured according to each variant's recipe. The green pandan flavour, the yellow yam and the brown coconut sugar flavours are the most common one.


== Ingredients ==
The basic ingredients of kue talam are rice flour, coconut milk, granulated sugar, salt, and pandan leaves. Other ingredients might be included to create the lower coloured part.
The top one is white and made simply using more coconut milk, rice flour, sugar and salt, and usually tastes savoury, mild sweet with softer creamy consistency. The bottom one is a little bit firmer and has colours according to added ingredients. The bottom coloured layer are poured first into the mold. After being half cooked being steamed for some times, the white layer is added on top and steamed further.
The mold being used traditionally is rectangular aluminium tray mold, hence the name talam (tray), thus the cake is required to be cut into rectangular or square shape prior of serving. Today however, the singular small cups akin to chawan (Chinese teacup) are often used as mold; either made from ceramics, aluminium, plastic or melamine.
