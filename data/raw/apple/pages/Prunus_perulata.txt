Prunus perulata (Chinese: 宿鳞稠李) is a species of bird cherry native to Sichuan and Yunnan in China, preferring to grow at 2400–3200 m. It is a tree typically 6–12 m tall. Its flowers are borne on a raceme, quite small, with dull white to creamy-yellow petals. Its closest relative is Prunus buergeriana, from which it is morphologically and genetically distinct.

Its fruit are consumed by the endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, Rhinopithecus bieti. It is a forest gap specialist, taking advantage of treefalls to establish at the shadier edges of gaps.
