Thai eggplant (Thai: มะเขือ, RTGS: makhuea) is the name for several varieties of eggplant used in Southeast Asian cuisines, most often of the eggplant species Solanum melongena. They are also cultivated in India and Sri Lanka and feature in Sri Lankan cuisine. These golf ball-sized eggplants are commonly used in Thai cuisine, Indonesian cuisine, and in Cambodian cuisine. Some cultivars in Thailand include Thai Purple, Thai Green, Thai Yellow, and Thai White.

=== Culinary ===
The green-white varieties of Thai eggplants are essential ingredients in Thai curry dishes such as in kaeng tai pla, green and red curry. They are often halved or quartered, but can also be used whole, and cooked in the curry sauce where they become softer and absorb the flavor of the sauce. They are also eaten raw in Thai salads or with Thai chili pastes (nam phrik).
Sometimes, in Thai restaurants outside of Thailand, Thai eggplants are replaced by locally available eggplants.

In Cambodian cuisine, they are often served raw with dipping sauce or cooked in stews. One of the most popular Cambodian steak sauces known as tuk prahok is made with the green-white variety (Khmer: ត្រប់ស្រួយ, romanized: trob sruoy).
In the Philippines, they are used in Ilocano cuisine, specifically in the dishes of pinakbet and dinengdeng. Boiled eggplant is frequently served with soy sauce and calamansi or dipping sauces made from bagoong, a fermented fish or shrimp paste.
