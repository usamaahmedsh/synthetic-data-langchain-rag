Tonto (also known as Mwenge Bigere) is a traditional fermented alcoholic beverage indigenous to Uganda primarily made from bananas. Also known by various local names including mwenge bigere and tontomera, the drink holds significant cultural importance in Ugandan society and is considered one of the country's most beloved traditional beverages. It is one of several banana-based alcoholic drinks in Ugandan culture, alongside others such as Waragi (a banana-based spirit) and banana wines. Tonto is widely consumed in the banana-growing regions of central and western Uganda.


== Production process ==
Tonto production begins with specific varieties of bananas traditionally used for brewing. The most common local banana varieties employed include kisubi, ndizi, musa, kivuru, kabula, and mbidde.
Tonto has an alcohol content ranging from 6 -11 % by volume, making it a mildly alcoholic beverage. The exact alcohol content can vary depending on the duration of fermentation and the specific ingredients used.
The traditional production method involves several key steps:

Ripening: Green bananas are placed in a pit and left to ripen over several days
Juice extraction: The sweet juice is pressed from the ripened bananas
Filtration: The extracted juice undergoes filtering to remove impurities
Fermentation: Grains of roasted sorghum are sprinkled into the filtered juice, which converts the natural sugars into ethanol through fermentation
Maturation: The mixture is left to ferment for up to two to four days, producing the final alcoholic beverage
Tonto has an alcohol content ranging from six to eleven percent by volume, making it a mildly alcoholic beverage. The exact alcohol content can vary depending on the duration of fermentation and the specific ingredients used.


== Cultural and economic significance ==
The production and sales of Tonto provide a significant source of income for many families in these regions. Small-scale producers often sell the drink locally. The drink is particularly popular in the central and western regions of Uganda, where banana cultivation is a major agricultural activity.
Tonto occupies a central place in Ugandan culture and social life. The beverage features prominently in traditional ceremonies, which often conclude at dusk with communal consumption of tonto. Folk singers have celebrated the drink in their songs, and politicians seeking to connect with common people often take ceremonial sips when campaigning for votes.
The drink represents one of several traditional alcoholic beverages in Uganda, alongside ajon (made from finger millet), omuramba (from sorghum), kweete (from maize and millet), and waragi (from molasses). Among these, tonto remains particularly popular due to its relatively simple production process and the abundance of banana cultivation in Uganda.


== Etymology ==
The name "tontomera" derives from the Luganda language and alludes to the poor coordination experienced by drinkers after consumption, reflecting the beverage's alcoholic potency. The alternative name "mwenge bigere" is commonly used in central Uganda.
