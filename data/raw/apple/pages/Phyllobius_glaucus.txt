Phyllobius glaucus is a species of weevil found across Europe, especially in carrs. It is a pest of a variety of fruit trees, but has little economic effect. It was first described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1763.


== Description ==
Adults grow to 8–12 millimetres (0.3–0.5 in) long. The body is black, but is covered with elongate, hair-like scales that give the animal a very variable, greenish-brown appearance. The legs are reddish brown.


== Distribution ==
Phyllobius glaucus is common and widespread in Europe. A single specimen of P. glaucus (under the name P. calcaratus) has been recorded from Canada, but this is thought to be an error.


== Ecology and life cycle ==

Phyllobius glaucus is associated with a wide range of trees and shrubs, and is a minor pest of fruit trees, including apples, pears, cherries and plums. The insects chew small holes in the leaves and petals of the trees. It is a typical component of the fauna of alder carr in northwestern Europe.


== Taxonomic history ==
Phyllobius glaucus was first described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in his 1763 work Entomologia Carniolica, under the name Curculio glaucus. A second species was later named Curculio glaucus, but has since been renamed to Coniocleonus glaucus. Taxonomic synonyms of Phyllobius glaucus include:
