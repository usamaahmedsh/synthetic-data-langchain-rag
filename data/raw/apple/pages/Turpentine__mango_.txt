The Turpentine mango is a group of mango (Mangifera indica) cultivars traditionally grown in the Caribbean, parts of Central and South America, and South Florida. Known for their fibrous flesh and strong resinous flavor, turpentine mangoes are primarily used in local consumption, juice production, preserves, or as rootstock due to their disease resistance and vigorous growth.


== Description ==
Turpentine mangoes are typically small to medium-sized fruits with thin skin and a high-fiber, juicy pulp. The flavor is distinctive and often described as resinous or piney, which is the origin of the "turpentine" name. Despite the name, the fruit is edible and safe for consumption, and the flavor is appreciated in some local traditions.


== Cultivation ==
These mangoes are well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and are commonly found in home gardens throughout the Caribbean and parts of Central America. In Florida, the turpentine mango is often used as a rootstock for grafting commercial mango varieties due to its strong disease resistance and tolerance to poor soil conditions.


== Uses ==
While the fibrous texture of turpentine mangoes makes them less desirable for fresh market sale, they are popular for making juice, chutneys, jams, and other processed mango products. Their strong aromatic profile is also valued in certain regional cuisines.


=== As rootstock ===
One of the most significant uses of the turpentine mango is as a rootstock in commercial and hobbyist mango cultivation. Its vigorous growth habit and resistance to common diseases such as anthracnose and powdery mildew make it a preferred choice for supporting grafted cultivars.
