Turón (Tagalog pronunciation: [tuˈɾɔn]; also known as lumpiang saging [Filipino for "banana lumpia"] or sagimis in dialectal Tagalog) is a Philippine snack made of thinly-sliced bananas (preferably saba or Cardaba bananas) rolled in a spring roll wrapper, fried till the wrapper is crisp, and coated with caramelized brown sugar. Turón can also include other fillings, the most common being jackfruit (langka), while other recipes include sweet potato (kamote), mango (mangga), or cheddar cheese and coconut (niyog).
Turón, though etymologically Spanish in origin, bears no similarities to the Spanish candy turrón (an almond nougat confection). It is a crunchy and chewy snack most commonly consumed during merienda or for dessert and is also a popular street food, usually sold with banana cue, camote cue, and maruya.

In Malabon, the term "turrón" or "turon" instead refers to a fried, lumpia-wrapper-enveloped dessert filled with sweet mung bean while the term valencia is used for the banana-filled variety. Malabon banana turon are generally sold as valencia trianggulo, which are uniquely triangle-shaped.
