Plinia spirito-santensis, commonly known as jabuticaba peluda de cruz (hairy cross jaboticaba) or Grimal in the United States, is a species of plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is endemic to broad-leafed coastal forests, at altitude, in eastern Brazil. The plant is a semideciduous shrub or small tree which can grow to between 3 and 6 metres tall. It produces edible deep reddish-purple berries, up to 30mm in diameter. At the apex of the fruit there is a small cross, from which the name derives.
In the US, this species is commonly named after Adolf Grimal, who collected this variety in South America and introduced it to Florida.
