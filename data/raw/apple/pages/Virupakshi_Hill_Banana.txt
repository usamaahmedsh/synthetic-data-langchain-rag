The banana is cultivated at higher altitudes along the Palani Hills in the Western Ghats. It is often grown as a rain-fed crop grown during the South-west monsoon season.

With various steps taken to alleviate the same, cultivation has expanded in the past decade.

The ripe fruits are firm with a thicker peel. The fruit is one of the five ingredients used in the Palani Panchamirtham, a unique panchamrita, made at the Dhandayuthapani Swamy Temple in Palani.
