"Son ar chistr" (lit. 'Song of cider', also called "Ev chistr ’ta Laou!", lit. 'Drink cider, Laou!') is a traditional song of Brittany, whose words in Breton were written in 1929 by two Morbihan teenagers Jean Bernard and Jean-Marie Prima. The melody was brought to prominence through a 1970 interpretation by famous Breton singer Alan Stivell, and also in 1976 by the Dutch band Bots under the name "Zeven dagen lang".


== History ==
In June 1976, a Dutch interpretation of Son ar chistr was released by the Dutch peacenik band Bots under the title Zeven Dagen Lang, seeing widescale popularity in the Netherlands and both West and East Germany, reaching number 23 in charts in the Netherlands. The song was released on the album Voor God En Vaderland, an ironic title chosen to mock the pro NATO rhetoric in the Netherlands at the time. The Bots version of the song was not a direct translation, but included a political message in line with the direction of the band.
Following this success, Bots attended the Festival of Political Songs in East Germany for several years - a festival organised by the FDJ and East German band Oktoberklub. A year later, Oktoberklub would release their own variant of the song, this time calling for revolutionary solidarity and in support of the exiled Chilean communist leader Luis Corvalan. After Bots performed at the festival Rock Gegen Rechts in 1979, the band released a version in German a year later, assisted in translation by writers including Wolf Biermann, Hanns Dieter Hüsch, Hannes Wader and Günter Wallraff. 
Through the political orientation of both Bots and Oktoberklub, Was Wollen Wir Trinken was used in numerous demonstrations during the European Peace Marches of the 1980s. With the popularity of both releases from Bots and Oktoberklub, both groups with significant influences in the folk music scene, the song became a staple of folk groups around the world and has been translated into many languages.
On the Runet, the German version of the song is often falsely believed to be associated with the Luftwaffe. The song became popular with Ukrainian units operating in the Donbass, likely unaware of its previous political connotations.
