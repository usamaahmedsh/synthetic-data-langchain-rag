Many lists of trees of Great Britain and Ireland have been written.  There are a number of issues surrounding the inclusion of a species in such a list. As can be seen from the outline of debate below, there is no 'correct' list of trees of Britain and Ireland.


== Issues of debate ==


=== Definition of species ===
There are a number of different opinions regarding the validity of some species, notably apomictic microspecies and whether some 'species' may actually be hybrids. In particular, the number and definition of species in the genera Sorbus (rowans, whitebeams etc.), Ulmus (elms) and Salix (willows) are open to debate.


=== Definition of native ===
Native species are considered to be species which are today present in the region in question, and have been continuously present in that region since a certain period of time. When applied to Britain and Ireland, three possible definitions of this time constraint are:

a species that colonised these islands during the retreat of ice at the end of the last ice age
a species that was present in these islands when the English Channel was created and the land bridge between Britain and continental Europe was flooded
a species that has colonised without human assistance; in some cases this is uncertain.
The only endemic tree species in Britain and Ireland (that is, that are native only to this region) are some apomictic whitebeams.
Species that were native in the region in prehistory before the last ice age, but not subsequently, are generally regarded as extinct and no longer native.
Many additional species have been imported by humans; the total list of all introduced trees numbers several thousand. A far smaller number of these have become widely naturalised, spreading by their own accord without recourse to further human assistance.


=== Definition of tree ===
A tree can be defined as a large, perennial, woody plant with secondary branches supported by a primary stem (compare with shrub). There is no set definition regarding minimum size, though most authors cite a tree species as being one which regularly reaches 6 m (20 ft) tall with a single stem. Species like Blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and Purple willow (Salix purpurea), which may reach 6 m but not on a single stem, are not treated as trees.

=== Native trees ===
Listing order follows taxonomic order per Mitchell 1974.

Rowans and Whitebeams
European Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia)
Common Whitebeam (Aria edulis, syn. Sorbus aria) and several related apomictic microspecies
Service Tree (Cormus domestica, syn. Sorbus domestica; discovered growing wild on a cliff in south Wales in the 1990s)
Wild Service Tree (Torminalis glaberrima, syn. Sorbus torminalis)
Apples
Crab Apple (Malus sylvestris)

Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos; southwestern Great Britain only)
Strawberry-trees
Strawberry-tree (Arbutus unedo; Ireland only; recent genetic studies suggest that it is not native, but an early Bronze Age introduction.)
Ashes
Common Ash (Fraxinus excelsior)


=== Native large shrubs ===
These larger shrubs occasionally reach tree height, but not on a single stem so do not qualify as trees:

Eared Willow (Salix aurita)
Purple Willow (Salix purpurea)
Rock Whitebeam (Sorbus rupicola)
Blackthorn (Prunus spinosa)
Alder Buckthorn (Frangula alnus)
Purging Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica)
Dogwood (Cornus sanguinea)
Common Privet (Ligustrum vulgare)
Elder (Sambucus nigra)
Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides)
Spindle (Euonymus europaeus)
Guelder Rose (Viburnum opulus)
Wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana)


=== Endemic species ===
An endemic species is a plant only native to a certain area. Outside this area, unless spread naturally it is considered non-native, usually as a result of cultivation.
Britain and Ireland have few endemic trees, most being micro-species of Whitebeam. But there are some interesting endemic trees nevertheless.

Apomictic Whitebeams endemic to the British Isles:
Sorbus arranensis – Isle of Arran only.
Arran Service Tree – Isle of Arran only.
Sorbus pseudomeinichii - Isle of Arran only.
Lancashire Whitebeam - North Lancashire & South Cumbria, around Morecambe Bay only.
English Whitebeam - Great Britain and Ireland only.
Bristol Whitebeam - Avon Gorge only.
