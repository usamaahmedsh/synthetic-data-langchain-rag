Prunus andersonii is a species of shrub in the rose family, part of the same genus as the peach, cherry, and almond. Its common names include desert peach and desert almond.


== Description ==
Prunus andersonii is a deciduous shrub approaching 2 metres (6+1⁄2 ft) in height, its tangling branches narrowing to spiny-tipped twigs. Serrated, lance-shaped to oval leaves occur in clusters, each leaf measuring up to 3 centimeters (1+1⁄4 in) long. The inflorescence is a solitary flower or pair of flowers. Each flower has usually five concave pink petals each just under 1 cm (3⁄8 in) long, with many whiskerlike stamens at the center. Flowers bloom before or at the same time as the leaves appear.
The fruit is a fuzzy reddish-orange drupe around 1 cm (3⁄8 in) wide. The fruits are fleshy in years with ample moisture, and dry in drought years. The seed is a heart-shaped stone. The plant reproduces sexually via germination of the seed, and vegetatively by sprouting from its rhizome. One plant may sprout and resprout from its rhizomes to form a very large clone which can spread over several acres.


== Taxonomy ==
It was named after Charles Lewis Anderson by Asa Gray.


== Distribution and habitat ==
It is native to eastern California and western Nevada, where it grows in forests and scrub in desert and mountains.


== Ecology ==
Many rodents collect and eat the fruits and cache the seeds.


== Uses ==
The fruit is reportedly edible. Among Native American groups, the Paiute used this plant for making tea and medicinal remedies, and the Cahuilla considered the fruit a delicacy.
