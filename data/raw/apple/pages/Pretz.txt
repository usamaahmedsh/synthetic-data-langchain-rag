Pretz (プリッツ, Purittsu) is a Japanese snack made by Ezaki Glico. Like Ezaki Glico's other popular snack, Pocky, Pretz is stick-shaped and comes with a texture similar to pretzels. Unlike Pocky, Pretz is dusted with seasonings instead of being enrobed in a flavoured fudge.
Pretz comes in multiple varieties and three sizes: Regular, Kid's, and Giant. Most Pretz come in the Regular size, with some flavours also being offered in Giant size. The Kid's size is a smaller pack of Pretz and is sweeter to appeal to children. Kid's packages also come with a cartoon child on the package. The Double Pretz variety offers two separate flavours on a single Pretz stick (one flavor on each half) and the Meets Wine variety is a cheese-flavored Pretz named to suggest it be paired with wine.
