Ballyfatten, sometimes stylized as Bally Fatten is a cultivar of domesticated apple. The Ballyfatten apple originated in Ballyfatten, Northern Ireland, in 1802. This particular cultivar of apple has long been popular in that area for its use in cooking and baking.


== Appearance and flavour ==
The fruit of a Ballyfatten apple tree is medium to large in size, with a round-conical shape. The skin is green with a strong red flush, and it is often dry with a mottled texture, while the flesh is firm, white, and slightly acidic. The apple's lenticels may be prominent and circled in red.
While Ballyfatten apples can be used directly after picking, they tend to be quite tart; a more common practice is for the apples to be put in storage and preserved, in which they sweeten rapidly when stored properly. Ballyfatten apples can be eaten raw, but they are often classified as a cooking apple. The firm, white flesh can be cooked down to a creamy, pleasant puree.


== Growth and life cycle ==
Ballyfatten apple seeds typically take 2-4 weeks to germinate, and once the seedlings have been properly germinated, they require 6-12 months of care before they can be transplanted. Once the mature seedling is relocated to the ground, the young tree takes 1-3 years to strengthen its structure and prepare for fruit production - known as a vegetative period.
With proper care, the Ballyfatten apple tree will reach full maturity in 4 to 5 years, and has the potential to continue producing fruit for decades after.


=== Size ===
A Ballyfatten apple tree will typically grow to a height of 12-15 feet, spreading 10-12 feet wide. In optimal conditions, the tree will experience a growth rate of one to two feet per year.
