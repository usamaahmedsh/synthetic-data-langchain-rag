Five Alive (French: Déli-cinq) is a line of fruit juice blends created by Minute Maid, a subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company. Both the name and the five colors of the logo refer to the five fruit juices each variety contains.
The juice line was first introduced in the late 1970s in both 12 US fl oz (350 ml) and 16 US fl oz (470 ml) cans. Marketing for Five Alive featured the slant rhyme catchphrase “get a taste for life”.
Starting in 1981, Five Alive was released in juice boxes alongside cans. By the 1990s, the beverages were no longer produced for the U.S. market. However, Five Alive continues to be produced and is widely available in Canada.
