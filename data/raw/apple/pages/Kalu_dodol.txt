Kalu dodol (Sinhala: කලු දොදොල්, Tamil: தொதல்) is a sweet dish, a type of dodol that is popular in Sri Lanka. The dark and sticky dish consists mainly of kithul jaggery (from the sap of the toddy palm), rice flour and coconut milk. It is difficult and time-consuming to prepare. The Hambanthota area is known for the production of this dish.


== Origins and history ==
Kalu dodol is believed to have been introduced to Sri Lanka by the Sri Lankan Malays, It has also been attributed to the Portuguese, who occupied parts of the country during the 16th and 17th centuries.
With the introduction of artificial ingredients the preparation of kalu dodol has occasionally deviated from the traditional recipes.
Kalu dodol, along with other traditional sweets, is commonly prepared and consumed in celebration of the Sinhala New Year.
