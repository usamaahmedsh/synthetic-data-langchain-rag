The 'Malihabadi Dusseheri' mango, is a mango cultivar primarily grown in the town of Malihabad, Lucknow district of Uttar Pradesh, India. The Malihabadi Dusseheri mangoes are unique from the Dussehri variety grown elsewhere in India.


== Name ==
The Malihabadi Dusseheri mango's legacy began in Lucknow Nawab's royal gardens during the 1700s. The original mother plant, estimated to be 200 years old, still blossoms in Dashaari village located under Kakori town, between Malihabad and Lucknow, the epicenter of this mango variety.


== History ==
According to local historical accounts, the first Dasheri mango tree was discovered by a servant of Abdul Hameed Khan of Malihabad, who later became known as Baba-e-Amba (Father of Mango).
It is said that while traveling to the nearby Dasheri village, the servant found a distinct mango fruit and brought it back to Abdul Hameed Khan. Impressed by its exceptional flavour and aroma, Abdul Hameed cultivated the seed and later performed one of the earliest known cases of mango grafting by crossbreeding it with other local varieties.
Through careful experimentation and cultivation, Abdul Hameed Khan and his son developed the Dasheri mango into its present-day form. The Khan family is credited with pioneering grafting techniques and introducing several famous Indian mango varieties, including Dasheri, Chaunsa and other cultivars that later spread across India and beyond.
Their contributions established Malihabad as the renowned Mango Belt of India, and the Dasheri mango remains one of the country’s most prized varieties.
This mango has the ability to get the attention. Its flavor and aroma are unmatched.


== Description ==
This mango variety boasts a small to medium-sized elongated fruit, sporting a vibrant yellow colour, with fibreless pulp, distinctive rich flavor, and excellent storage durability. 


=== Uniqueness ===
Malihabad's traditional mango growers claim that 'Dusseheri' mangoes grown elsewhere lack the region's signature characteristics. For over 300 years, Malihabad's distinct soil, climate, and geology have infused 'Malihabadi Dusseheri' mangoes with pleasant flavor, rich sweetness, fibreless pulp, and excellent keeping quality.
