Manilkara zapota, commonly known as sapodilla (Spanish: [ˌsapoˈðiʝa]), sapote, chicozapote, chico, chicoo, chicle, naseberry, nispero, or
soapapple, among other names, is an evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. An example natural occurrence is in coastal Yucatán, in the Petenes mangroves ecoregion, where it is a subdominant plant species. It was introduced to the Philippines during Spanish colonization. It is grown in large quantities in Mexico and in tropical Asia, including India, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, as well as in the Caribbean.


== Common names ==
Most of the common names of Manilkara zapota like "sapodilla", "chiku", and "chicozapote" come from Spanish meaning "little sapote". Other common names in English include bully tree, soapapple tree, sawo, marmalade plum and dilly tree.
The specific epithet zapota is from the Spanish zapote [saˈpote], which ultimately derives from the Nahuatl word tzapotl used for other similar looking fruits.


== Description ==

A sapodilla tree can live up to one hundred years. It can grow to more than 30 m (98 ft) tall with a trunk diameter of up to 1.5 m (5 ft); but the average height of cultivated specimens is usually between 9 and 15 m (30 and 49 ft) with a trunk diameter not exceeding 50 cm (20 in). It is wind-resistant and the bark is rich in a white, gummy latex called chicle. Its leaves are elliptic to ovate 6–15 cm (2–6 in) long with entire margins on 1–3 cm (0–1 in) long petioles; they are medium green and glossy with brown and slightly furry midribs. They are arranged alternately.
The trees can survive only in warm, typically tropical environments (although it has low tolerance to drought and heat in its early years), dying easily if the temperature drops below freezing. From germination, the sapodilla tree will usually take anywhere from five to eight years to bear fruit. The sapodilla trees yield fruit twice a year, though flowering may continue year round.
The white flowers are inconspicuous and bell-like, with a six-lobed corolla.


=== Fruit ===

The fruit is a large berry, 4–8 cm (2–3 in) in diameter. An unripe fruit has a firm outer skin and when picked, releases white latex (chicle) from its stem. A fully ripened fruit has saggy skin and does not release chicle when picked. Inside, its flesh ranges from a pale yellow to an earthy brown color with a grainy texture akin to that of a well-ripened pear. Each fruit contains one to six seeds. The seeds are hard, glossy, and black, resembling beans, with a hook at one end that can catch in the throat if swallowed.
The ripe fruit has an exceptionally sweet, malty flavor. The unripe fruit is hard to the touch and contains high amounts of saponin, which has astringent properties similar to tannin, drying out the mouth.


== Biological studies ==
Compounds extracted from the leaves showed anti-diabetic, antioxidant and hypocholesterolemic (cholesterol-lowering) effects in rats.
Acetone extracts of the seeds exhibited in vitro antibacterial effects against strains of Pseudomonas oleovorans and Vibrio cholerae.


== Synonyms ==
Synonyms of this species include:


== Uses ==
The fruit is edible and a favorite in the tropical Americas. Chicle from the bark is used to make chewing gum.
