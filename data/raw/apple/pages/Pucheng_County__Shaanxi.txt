== Toponymy ==
According to the Taiping Huanyu Ji, the county derives its name from an ancient city named Pucheng (Chinese: 蒲城; pinyin: Púchéng) in the area that existed during the Western Wei.


== History ==
During the Spring and Autumn period, a city named Chongquan (Chinese: 重泉; pinyin: Chóngquán) was established in the southeast of present-day Pucheng County.
During the Qin dynasty, the area was organized as Chongquan County (simplified Chinese: 重泉县; traditional Chinese: 重泉縣; pinyin: Chóngquán Xiàn). Chongquan County would exist for more than 600 years, before eventually being abolished during the Northern Wei dynasty. In 487 CE, under the Northern Wei, the area was reorganized as Nanbaishui County (simplified Chinese: 南白水县; traditional Chinese: 南白水縣; pinyin: Nánbáishuǐ Xiàn). In 540 CE, during the Western Wei, the area was renamed to Pucheng County (simplified Chinese: 蒲城县; traditional Chinese: 蒲城縣; pinyin: Púchéng Xiàn), its current name. Pucheng County was renamed to Fengxian County (simplified Chinese: 奉先县; traditional Chinese: 奉先縣; pinyin: Fèngxiān Xiàn) in 716 CE, during the Tang dynasty. The new name, Fengxian, was derived from a phrase calling for people to worship Emperor Ruizong, who had died that year, and was buried in the Qiaoling Mausoleum located in the county. Fengxian County was renamed back to Pucheng County in 971 CE, during the Song dynasty, and has remained unnamed since.
In January 2025, there were violent protests in Pucheng County after the death of a student in disputed circumstances.
