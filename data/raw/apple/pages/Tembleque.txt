Tembleque is a coconut dessert pudding from Puerto Rico similar to blancmange and related to Spanish manjar blanco and Filipino maja blanca. It is one of the most popular desserts in Puerto Rican cuisine.


== Ingredients ==
Tembleque is made by simmering and constantly stirring coconut milk, heavy cream (optional), salt, cornstarch, and sugar until thick. It is then placed in to a mold and set to chill. When chilled it should be smooth, stiff with the texture similar to jello or pudding. Garnished with ground cinnamon. Orange blossom water is a very popular ingredient that some considered traditional. 
Tembleque can also be topped with a fruit relish or chocolate shavings. 


== Cultural importance ==
It is a holiday dish, served on New Year's Day throughout the island of Puerto Rico. While the recipe may have originated in Puerto Rico, there are variants on the dish manjar blanco in Latin America, manjar branco in Brazil, and maja blanca in the Philippines. According to the Encyclopedia of Puerto Rico, published by the Foundation for the Humanities, each time a Puerto Rican migrant to the  United States comes closer and closer to forgetting their roots, foods like tembleque bring them back and remind them of who they are, of their island, and of their grandmother.
