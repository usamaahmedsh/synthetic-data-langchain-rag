However, they are distinctly different in leaves, flowers and fruits. P. triloba have slightly trilobed leaves, campanulate calyx tubes, unpitted stones, and fruits splitting when ripe, whereas P. ulmifolia have leaves without lobes, cylindrical calyx tubes, stones finely pitted with irregularly branching furrows, and fruits not splitting.
