James Edward Bacon was an American rancher who screened avocado trees for cold hardiness in Buena Park, California by growing hundreds of Mexican and hybrid seedlings. He has been called "the world's first genuine avocado breeder".
James Bacon was born in the Bacon House at Buena Park, which was moved to Buena Park's Historical District in 1994 and turned into a museum.
In 1985, Bacon and his wife donated $53,000 to the Fullerton Arboretum, calling it "a worthwhile recipient", by creating an endowment to "provide monies to assist in the operational and education activities of the arboretum."
