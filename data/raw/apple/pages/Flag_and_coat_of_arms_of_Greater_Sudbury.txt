The coat of arms of Greater Sudbury is the official heraldic symbol of the City of Greater Sudbury, a city in the Canadian Province of Ontario. The flag of Greater Sudbury is a banner of these arms. The letters patent were granted to the city by the Canadian Heraldic Authority on December 15, 2003.

The coat of arms can be described as follows: Per fess sapiné Vert and Or, in dexter chief a mullet Or; The crest: A mural crown Vert set with pine cones Or; Both supporters are moose Or, that to the dexter gorged with a coronet erablé, that to the sinister gorged with a coronet fleurdelisé Vert, both are standing on a rocky mount set with blueberry plants proper; below which is placed a scroll with the motto Aedificemus, Latin for "Let us build". 
The Canadian Heraldic Authority's official blazon of the coat of arms is:

Arms: Per fess sapiné Vert and Or, in dexter chief a mullet Or.

Supporters: Two moose Or, that to the dexter gorged with a coronet erablé, that to the sinister gorged with a coronet fleurdelisé Vert, both standing on a rocky mount set with blueberry plants proper.
Motto: Aedificemus
The arms displayed on the shield are designed to represent the white pine forests of region, as well as subsequent regreening efforts. The use of pine cones represents rebirth as well as Ste-Anne-des-Pins, the original name of Sudbury.

Prior to the creation of Greater Sudbury in 2001, a different crest was used. The crest consisted of three bands symbolizing the farming, logging, and mining industries, supported by pine branches, maple leaves, and a moose, with the motto Industry, Enterprise, Integrity.
