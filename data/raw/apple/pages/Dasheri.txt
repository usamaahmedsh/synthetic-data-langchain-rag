== History ==

Dasheri mango was originated in the Lucknow  district of Uttar Pradesh. 
The first Plant of Dasheri mango, today known as "Mother Dasehri Tree", originated in the Village Dasehri, Block Kakori Dist. Lucknow in the Orchard of Nawab Syed Anser Zaidi Sahab. The Mother Dasehri is still in the possession of Nawab Anser's family. This tree is approximately 185 years old and still bears fruits.
According to local historical accounts, the first Dasheri mango tree was discovered by a servant of Abdul Hameed Khan of Malihabad, who later became known as Baba-e-Amba (Father of Mango).
It is said that while traveling to the nearby Dasheri village, the servant found a distinct mango fruit and brought it back to Abdul Hameed Khan. Impressed by its exceptional flavour and aroma, Abdul Hameed cultivated the seed and later performed one of the earliest known cases of mango grafting by crossbreeding it with other local varieties.
Through careful experimentation and cultivation, Abdul Hameed Khan and his son developed the Dasheri mango into its present-day form. The Khan family is credited with pioneering grafting techniques and introducing several famous Indian mango varieties, including Dasheri, Chaunsa and other cultivars that later spread across India and beyond.
Their contributions established Malihabad as the renowned Mango Belt of India, and the Dasheri mango remains one of the country’s most prized varieties.
