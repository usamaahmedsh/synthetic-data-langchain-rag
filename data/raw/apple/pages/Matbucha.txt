Matbucha (Arabic: مطبوخة, maṭbūkhah; French: salade cuite) is a North African condiment or cooked salad consisting of cooked tomatoes and roasted bell peppers seasoned with garlic and chili pepper, and slow-cooked for a number of hours. It is traditionally served in North Africa with a traditional Moroccan bread and as a condiment typically served as part of an appetizer, often as part of a salad course.
Matbucha has been brought to Israel by Moroccan Jews and is now a staple in the country, it may be enjoyed as a dip or used as a base for shakshouka.
