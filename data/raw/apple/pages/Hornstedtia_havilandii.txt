== Description ==
The species grows as a clump of leafy shoots forming pseudostems to 3–4 m in height from branching rhizomes. The inflorescence, 20–40 cm tall, rises directly from the rhizome. The flowers are red with white lips. The rectangular, edible fruits, 3 x 1.5 cm, ripen cream to yellow, containing many small black seeds in a translucent whitish aril.


== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is found in the lowland and mixed dipterocarp forest, as well as riparian forest, at elevations of up to 1,000 m.
