Budino (lit. 'pudding') is a sweet Italian dessert, usually rich and creamy like a custard or pudding. Like the English word 'pudding', budino originally referred to a type of medieval sausage. It can be thickened with cornstarch or cookies to make it more like a soufflé or ganache, and it can be sauced with various flavors, including chocolate, caramel, apple, and butterscotch.
