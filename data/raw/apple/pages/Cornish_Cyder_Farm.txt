== History of Healeys ==
Healey's was opened to the general public in 1986 by David and Kay Healey, after they had been running an off-licence in Mevagissey. During their time managing an off-licence they realised how popular Cornish Cyder is, they initially began making Cyder for themselves at their smallholding near St Austell. The current site of the Cyder Farm is Penhallow near Truro, Cornwall. The original farm is over 150 years old, and had been a mixed arable and cattle farm.
The whisky was produced in a partnership with St Austell Brewery. It is the first commercial whisky to be produced in Cornwall in 300 years.
