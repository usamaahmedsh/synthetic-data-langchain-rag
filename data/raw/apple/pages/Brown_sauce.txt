== Description ==
Brown sauce is a condiment commonly served with food in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is normally dark brown in colour. The taste is either tart or sweet with a peppery taste similar to that of Worcestershire sauce. Commercial sauces frequently contain tomatoes, malt vinegar, molasses, dates, spices and tamarind.


== Use ==
Brown sauce is typically eaten with meals such as meat pies, full breakfasts, bacon sandwiches and chips. A combination of malt vinegar (or water) and brown sauce known simply as sauce or chippy sauce is popular on fish and chips in Edinburgh.


== History ==
The first brown sauce—Brand's A.1. sauce—was introduced in 1831. It was made in Vauxhall, London.
In 1837, Yorkshire Relish, of a similar style to brown sauce, was created in Leeds, England. It is relatively unknown in the UK today  but in the latter part of the 19th century, in Sheffield, Henry Henderson began manufacturing Henderson's Relish which remains popular today.
Although not a generally available commercial product, a recipe for "sauce for steaks" composed of ale, wine, ketchup, black pepper and butter appeared in an 1843 cookbook published in London entitled English Cookery.
A brown sauce still popular today, HP Sauce, was introduced in the United Kingdom by Frederick Gibson Garton in 1884 in Nottinghamshire. Some sources claim that Garton bought the recipe from David Hoe, who had created it in Leicestershire in the 1850s.
