'Macoun' apples are a cross between the McIntosh and Jersey Black cultivars. The Macoun ("Ma-cown," after the variety's namesake, Canadian horticulturalist W.T. Macoun, but sometimes also pronounced either "Ma-coon" or "McCowan") was developed at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, by Richard Wellington. It was first introduced in 1932, and is an eating apple. This apple is popular for making European style apple pies because it does not break down during cooking and remains firm. Macouns are also very popular at roadside stands and pick-your-own farms. Availability is generally October through November.
Aside from its short season of availability, the popularity of the apple is compromised by the problems it gives orchardists. The Macoun has a short stem, and there is a tendency for the apple to push itself off the branch as the fruit matures; also, the Macoun tends not to produce reliable crops each year, with a good harvest followed by a sparser one.
The patent application for the Honeycrisp apple stated that it was descended from Macoun crossed with Honeygold, but this has since been disproved by genetic testing.
The Price look-up code for all sizes of Macoun apples is 3073.
