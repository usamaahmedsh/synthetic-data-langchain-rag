The piquillo pepper is a variety of chili, Capsicum annuum known for having a  sweet taste with little to no heat. The  fruits are  about 7 cm long and thrive  in pots that are traditionally grown in Northern Spain near the town of Lodosa. The name ‘piquillo’  is derived from the Spanish word  for "little beak".


== Preparation ==
Typically, the peppers are hand-picked during two harvest seasons between September and December. They are roasted over embers, which gives them a distinct sweet, spicy flavour, more akin to bell peppers than chilli peppers, despite their small size. The peppers  are then peeled and again grilled in a grill bar for extra flavour and texture then marinated with salt, pepper, and olive oil and then de-seeded by hand, before being packed into jars or tins for sale. Piquillo peppers are often stuffed with meat, seafood, or cheese, and served as tapas.


== Nutrition ==
Piquillo peppers are high in fiber and vitamins C, E, A, and B. In particular, their vitamin C content is very high, comparable to a citrus fruit.
