Watsonia humilis is a plant belonging to the genus Watsonia and is part of the fynbos. The species is endemic to the Western Cape. The plant has lost 90% of its historical habitat to suburban development and agricultural activities. The threat continues and invasive species have also become a threat. There are currently only two known subpopulations, one at Gordon's Bay - less than 50 plants - and a second in the Breede River Valley near Wolseley. The latter was only discovered in 2012.
