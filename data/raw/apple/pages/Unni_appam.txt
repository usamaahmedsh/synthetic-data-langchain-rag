Unni appam (Malayalam: ഉണ്ണിയപ്പം) is a small round snack made from rice, jaggery, banana, roasted coconut pieces, roasted sesame seeds, ghee and cardamom powder fried in oil. Variations of this organic and spongy fried batter using jackfruit preserves instead of banana are common. It is a popular snack in Kerala. In Malayalam, unni means 'small' and appam means 'rice cake'.
