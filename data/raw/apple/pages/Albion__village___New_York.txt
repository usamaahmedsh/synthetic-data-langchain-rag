== History ==
The Albion area was first settled by European Americans in 1812. This area attracted few residents before the announcement, near the end of the decade, that the Erie Canal would be constructed through here. In 1822, an entrepreneur named Nehemiah Ingersoll bought much of the land near the planned intersection of the canal and Oak Orchard Road, the main north–south route through the area at the time. The property was soon subdivided, and the village, then known as Newport, began to grow.
Orleans County was created two years later. State officials considered both Gaines (then more populous) and Newport as the county seat due to their central locations within the new county. They chose Newport in 1826 due to its location on the canal and the West Branch of Sandy Creek, where a mill had already been established. The next year the village changed its name to Albion to avoid postal confusion with New York's other Newport, in Oneida County. In 1828 it was incorporated as a village.
The William V. N. Barlow House, North Main–Bank Streets Historic District, Orleans County Courthouse Historic District, Tousley-Church House, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
