Satiety value is the degree at which food gives a human the feeling of satiety per calorie. The concept of the Satiety Value and Satiety Index was developed by Australian researcher and doctor, Susanna Holt. Highest satiety value is expected when the food that remains in the stomach for a longer period produces greatest functional activity of the organ. Limiting the food intake after reaching the satiety value helps reduce obesity problems.
Foods with the most satiation per calorie are often:

high in certain proteinase inhibitors that suppress appetite - e.g. potatoes
high in protein (which takes longer to digest than other energy sources) - e.g. meat
low in glycemic index (in which the carbohydrates take longer to digest) - e.g. oats
high in fibre (which takes longer to digest than low fibre foods) - e.g. fruit
low in calories - e.g. vegetables
solid (which takes longer to digest than liquid foods, though liquids have high satiety for a short period)
The protein leverage hypothesis posits that human beings will prioritize the consumption of protein in food over other dietary components, and will eat until protein needs have been met, regardless of energy content, thus leading of over-consumption of foodstuffs when their protein content is low.
Sugar-sweetened beverage showed lower satiety compared to isocaloric semi-skimmed milk.
Alcoholic beverages tend to have a lower satiety per calorie.
Fruit juice with and without pulp was shown to result in lower satiety than comparable amounts of fruits.
Further factors involved in determining the satiety of foods are covered in the expected satiety entry.
