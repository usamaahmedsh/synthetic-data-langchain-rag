Shock Top is an American, Belgian-Style, spiced witbier brand introduced as a seasonal beer by Anheuser-Busch in February 2006, however, the beer's popularity quickly grew and was used as a rival to Molson Coors' Blue Moon. The brand entered a decline following a failed rebranding effort in 2017 and, citing financial shortfall in part due to the 2023 Bud Light boycott, Anheuser-Busch sold the brand to Tilray in August 2023.


== History ==


=== Founding ===

The brand was introduced in February 2006 with its flagship Belgian White Witbeer. Anheuser-Busch advertised the beer as if it were an upstart craft beer brewed by a small team, however, this was simply a move by Anheuser-Busch tap into the craft beer market. The early brand was described by the Dallas Observer as "the perfect symbol of Anheuser-Busch InBev's utter contempt for and cluelessness about the culture of craft beer." As the company sent out large packages to reviewers containing hundreds of dollars of merchandise, and two beers the Observer described as "Beyond awful." During Super Bowl 50 in 2016, Shock Top ran a Super Bowl ad starring comedian T.J. Miller. Anheuser-Busch intended that the ad simply put Shock Top on the map for beer drinkers and act as a stepping stone for their consumer base that enjoy Bud Light towards a more craft beer direction. The ad was not well received with Variety describing it as having the quality and prose of a YouTube ad, not a multi-million-dollar Super Bowl ad. The ad came in the midst of a close race with Molson Coors' Blue Moon, with the two brands being neck and neck in market control for Belgian Witbeers. However, despite the ad resulting in a 21%  brand recognition among the 21+ age demographic, Blue Moon simply outpaced Shock Top with a campaign of smaller ads and word of mouth advertising.


=== 2017 rebranding ===
On February 27, 2017, after 11 years of operation, Anheuser-Busch announced a total re-brand of Shock Top, with a new simplified logo focusing more on "Wedgehead" the brand's mascot, an orange wedge with a Mohawk and sunglasses, as well as introducing vibrantly colored packages, and a new, smaller, slate of products in an effort to brand the company with a "laid-back carefree attitude."
By the time of their purchase with Tilray, the company only sold two beverages. Their flagship Belgian White, and Zest.


=== Tilray sale ===
On August 7, Anheuser-Busch sold Shock Top, and seven other brands, to Tilray, along with all current employees, breweries and brewpubs associated with the brand. The move came after Anheuser-Busch re-evaluated if they wished to continue their partnership and ownership of the various Craft Brew Alliance brands, while also shedding some of their less profitable brands in the wake of the financial contraction to the company brought on by the 2023 Bud Light boycott. The move made Tilray the fifth largest craft beer producer in the country.

The beer was Anheuser-Busch's first, and then only, foray into hard cider, until their release of Johnny Appleseed in 2014.


=== Raspberry Wheat ===
A Raspberry flavored witbeer, "Raspberry Wheat" was introduced as the brand's original seasonal winter beer in 2011, the beer struggled due to the rise in popularity in pumpkin themed winter and fall beer, and was discontinued in 2016.


== Sustainability ==
In 2015, Shock Top donated $100,000 to Drop-A-Brick, a company that produces rubber bricks to be placed in toilets to reduce their water consumption. The donation saved the project from going under and highlighted the breweries interest in water conservation. All Shock Top breweries are designed to create as little water waste as possible.
