In 1882, Hiram Hughson arrived in the area east of Ceres and north of Denair, California, purchasing land and eventually owning 5,000 acres. In recognition of his holdings, the San Joaquin Railroad named their local stop "Hughson" in the early 1900s. In 1907, Hiram Hughson and neighboring landowner John Tully opened up their land for settlement. As new inhabitants arrived, the area became known as Hughson Township. On December 9, 1972, Hughson was incorporated as a city.

Hughson is surrounded by orchards and has been a long-time farming community. Initially, it was known for its enormous production of peaches, which garnered the area the title "The Peach Capital of the World". Peaches are no longer the primary crop in the area and have been replaced for the most part by almond trees. Almond production in the area is one of the largest in the world. Other crops grown in Hughson include walnuts, nectarines, cherries, apples, and the occasional vineyard.
In recent years, many orchards have been torn down due to development.
