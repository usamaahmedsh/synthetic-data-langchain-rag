Cobden is a village in Union County, Illinois, United States, within the Southern Illinois region informally known as "Little Egypt.” The population estimate as of 2025  is 1,064. Cobden is regionally known for the mascot of its public school district, Cobden Unit School District #17. Known as the "Appleknockers,” a tribute to traveling farm laborers, Cobden's mascot has been regarded as one of the most unique high school mascots in the country by several publications and public voting contests.
Cobden and surrounding areas is widely known for its many wineries and orchards, most notably Flamm Orchards, along Old U.S. Route 51, and Rendleman Orchard in nearby Alto Pass, Illinois.


== History ==
The village is named after British politician Richard Cobden, who visited the town in 1859. An early variant name was "South Pass".
Cobden began as an agricultural town and developed around the tracks of a route owned by the Illinois Central Railroad (now owned by Canadian National Railway), as well as being along a main highway, U.S. Highway 51, running through the region.


=== Mascot ===
Cobden's mascot is the "Appleknocker," a man with freckles wearing a straw hat and chewing on a piece of straw.  This nickname originated when the high school first began to compete in athletics. It did not yet have a mascot, so other schools made up this derogatory term to insult the new school because of its large industry in peach and apple orchards.  However, when Cobden High School played for the Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship in 1964, this name was cemented in the town's history and became part of its cultural identity, even though it lost to Pekin High School 50–45.

Cobden is located near the crest of the Shawnee Hills. It is in "Cobden Col", a valley cut into rock by water near the summit of this ancient mountain range. Approximately 100,000 years ago, the Illinoian ice sheet covered almost all of Illinois. As it pushed south, the ice sheet climbed the Shawnee Mountains. The height of the ice sheet was much greater than that of the mountains. It stopped before it reached their summits. As it melted, a lake formed between the mountains and the glacier. Cobden Col was the outlet of this lake.
