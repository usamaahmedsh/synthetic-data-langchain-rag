Mango float or crema de mangga is a Filipino icebox cake dessert made with layers of ladyfingers (broas) or graham crackers, whipped cream, condensed milk, and ripe carabao mangoes. It is chilled for a few hours before serving, though it can also be frozen to give it an ice cream-like consistency. It is a modern variant of the traditional Filipino crema de fruta cake. It is also known by other names like mango refrigerator cake, mango graham float, mango royale, and mango icebox cake, among others. Crema de mangga is another version that additionally uses custard and gulaman (agar) or gelatin, as in the original crema de fruta.
Mango float may also be made with various other fruits including strawberries, pineapple, bananas, and cherries among others. Combinations of different fruits result in a version closer to the original crema de fruta.
A milkshake version of the recipe made with milk, whipped cream, graham cracker crumbs, and puréed mangoes is also popular.
