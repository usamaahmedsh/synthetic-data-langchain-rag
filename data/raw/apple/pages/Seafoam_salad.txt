Seafoam salad (made with lime-flavored jello), also known as orange salad (made with orange-flavored jello), is a cafeteria and buffet staple popularized by F. W. Woolworth's lunch counters.  Seafoam salad is often considered a dessert because of its sweetness, and so is one of many dessert salads. It is composed of green lime-flavored gelatin, cream cheese, pears, maraschino cherries, and whipped topping.
Multiple versions of the recipe exist; variations include substituting crushed pineapple for the pears, or adding mayonnaise and nuts to the mixture, thereby making it less sweet.
