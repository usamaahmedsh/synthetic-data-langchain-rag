Musa juwiniana is a species of wild banana from the genus Musa (Musaceae).


== Distribution and origin ==
Musa juwiniana is native to Sarawak, Malaysia, specifically in the northern east region near Loagan Bunut National Park. It is commonly found by the roadside in this area, suggesting it thrives in the tropical environments typical of Borneo. The species was first identified in this region, with its type specimen collected from Lapok, near Loagan Bunut National Park, in 2008.  


== Description ==
As a member of the genus Musa, Musa juwiniana is an herbaceous perennial with a pseudostem formed by tightly packed leaf sheaths. It features large leaves and produces inflorescences with female flowers at the base and male flowers at the tip. The fruits are berries distinguished by a biserrate (double-serrated) edge, a unique characteristic of this species. The male flowers also exhibit this biserrate feature. It belongs to the Callimusa section of the genus Musa, which is defined by a chromosome number of n = x = 10. The species is closely related to Musa campestris and Musa voonii, sharing morphological similarities but set apart by its distinctive biserrate fruits and male flowers.
