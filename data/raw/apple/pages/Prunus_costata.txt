Prunus costata is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to New Guinea. It is a tree reaching 25 m, and is morphologically very similar to Prunus grisea var grisea, aside from their seeds. It flowers are borne on a raceme and have white petals only 1-3 mm long, with 20 to 35 stamens each. The numerous stamens are typically 5.5 mm long, giving the flowers a bristly appearance. P. costata flowers 3 to 4 times per year, and successfully sets fruit after most flowerings. The type specimen was collected on Mt. Scratchley at 10,000 to 13,000 ft (3,000–4,000 m).
