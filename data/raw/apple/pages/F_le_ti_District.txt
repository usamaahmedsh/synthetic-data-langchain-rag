Fălești (pronunciation: [fəˈleʃtʲ]) is a district (Romanian: raion) in the north of Moldova, with its administrative center in the town of Fălești. The district borders Western Moldavia in Romania.


== History ==
District settlements with the earliest historical attestation are Fălești, Scumpia, Călugăr, and Horești, whose first documentary mentions date from the years 1429–1437. Between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, the area experienced economic and cultural development, driven by expanding trade and a steady increase in population.
During the 18th century, the region experienced a period of decline due to the ongoing Russo-Turkish wars, fought primarily between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, with the Danubian Principalities, including Moldavia, often caught in the crossfire. In 1812, following the Treaty of Bucharest, Bessarabia was annexed from Moldavia. Under Tsarist rule, policies of Russification encouraged the settlement of Ukrainians and Russians in the area, whose descendants today make up roughly 15% of the district’s population.
In 1918, after the collapse of the Russian Empire, Bessarabia united with Romania. In 1940, following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the region was incorporated into the Soviet Union. From 1944 to 1991, Fălești District formed part of the MSSR. After the proclamation of Moldova’s independence in 1991, it became an administrative division that later, in 1998, was reorganized into Ungheni County. In 2003, Fălești was reestablished as a separate administrative unit of the Republic of Moldova.
