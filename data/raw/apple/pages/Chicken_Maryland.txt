Chicken Maryland or Maryland chicken is a historic dish associated with the U.S. state of Maryland, but has other meanings from other nations. In its home base, the food dish consists of fried chicken served with a cream gravy. It is traditionally garnished with bananas, which were historically one of Baltimore's leading imports.


== History and preparation ==
Many Maryland families have their own heirloom recipes for this dish, and it remains a regional specialty in Eastern Shore restaurants.
The primary factor that distinguishes Maryland fried chicken is pan-fried in a heavy (traditionally cast-iron) skillet and covered tightly after the initial browning so that the chicken steams as well as fries. Milk or cream is then added to the pan juices to create a white cream gravy, another Maryland characteristic.
Escoffier had a recipe for Poulet sauté Maryland  in his landmark cookbook Ma Cuisine.
