The Victoria plum is a type of English plum. It has a yellow flesh with a red or mottled skin. This plum is a cultivar of the egg plum group (Prunus domestica ssp. intermedia).
The fruit is oval or ovate in shape. The ground colour is greenish yellow, mostly covered with purple. The stone is semi-clinging and does not come off completely from the flesh but the skin is easy to pull off. The flesh is quite rough, light yellow and in good development and full maturity is sweet and tasty. Maturation time is mid-to-late September (in some places). It is a good table and household fruit.
The tree is quite hardy and grows strongly but is not very large. The bloom is medium-early and self-fertile. The plant itself is rarely attacked by diseases, but the fruit is vulnerable to mold. Fruits must be thinned heavily for the fruits to reach full development. The trees rarely get old due to their high fruit production.
The name "Victoria" comes from Queen Victoria (1819–1901). A story that the variety was first discovered in a garden in Alderton, Sussex is probably true as there place named Alderton in Sussex. Alderton is a village and civil parish in the East Suffolk district of Suffolk, England, about six miles north of Felixstowe, 10 miles south-east of Woodbridge and 2 miles south of Hollesley, on the North Sea coast and in the heart of the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In 2007 its population was 430, reducing to 423 at the 2011 Census.
It was introduced commercially in Sweden in 1844 by a nursery owner, Denyer, under the name of Denyer's Victoria. This strain quickly became very popular in Sweden in the late 19th century.
The Victoria plum contains the anthocyanin chrysanthemin.
