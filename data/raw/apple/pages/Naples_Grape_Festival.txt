The Naples Grape Festival is an annual festival in Naples, New York, United States, dedicated to grapes. The town of Naples is in the center of Finger Lakes American Viticultural Area (AVA), a region known for grape-growing and wine making in the Finger Lakes area of Upstate New York. Around 80,000 people attend the festival each year.
The festival, which has been held since 1961, includes arts and crafts vendors, a wine-tasting tent, food, live music,
 and a grape pie contest. One festival casualty was in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused it to be cancelled.
