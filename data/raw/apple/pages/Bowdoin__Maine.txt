== History ==
Bowdoin was part of a tract of land extending from Merrymeeting Bay to the Androscoggin River that was conveyed in 1752 by the Kennebec Company to William Bowdoin of Boston, older brother of James Bowdoin. Originally called West Bowdoinham Plantation, it was settled some years before the Revolutionary War. In 1773, William Bowdoin died, and by 1779 James Bowdoin had legal claim to the area and was granting deeds. It contained about 121 families when the town was incorporated by the Massachusetts General Court on March 21, 1788, named after the Bowdoin family. In 1799, it ceded land to form Thompsonborough, whose name changed in 1802 to Lisbon. In 1834, it ceded more territory to Lisbon.
Bowdoin developed as an agricultural town, raising sheep and producing apples, wheat, hay and potatoes. Other industries included an ice company, sawmill, gristmill, carding mill and brickyard. Since 1993, alpacas have been raised in the town.
In 2023, four people were killed in a shooting and three more were injured. The same year, 18 people were shot dead in a shooting rampage in nearby Lewiston; the suspect’s house was in Bowdoin, and was the scene of a massive police search.
