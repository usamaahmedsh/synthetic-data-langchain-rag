Tumpeng (Javanese: ꦠꦸꦩ꧀ꦥꦼꦁ; Balinese: ᬢᬸᬫ᭄ᬧᭂᬂ) is an Indonesian cone-shaped rice dish with side dishes of vegetables and meat originating from Javanese cuisine. Traditionally featured in the slametan ceremony, the rice is made by using a cone-shaped woven bamboo container. The rice itself may be plain steamed rice, uduk rice (cooked with coconut milk), or yellow rice (uduk rice colored with turmeric).
The rice cone is set out on the tampah (rounded woven bamboo container), covered with a banana leaf, and surrounded by assorted Indonesian dishes. In 2013, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy promoted tumpeng as one of 30 Indonesian culinary icons and declared it Indonesia's official national dish in 2014, describing it as "the dish that binds the diversity of Indonesian various culinary traditions".
Tumpeng is a symbol of gratitude. According to folklore in Java and Bali, the cone-shaped dish symbolises life and the glory of God as the creator of nature, and the side dishes and vegetables represent the life and harmony of nature. Usually, tumpeng is served with spinach, which is a traditional symbol of prosperity in Javanese agricultural society.
