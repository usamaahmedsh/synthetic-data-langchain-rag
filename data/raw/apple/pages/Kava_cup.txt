In Fijian traditions and ceremonies, a kava cup, also called a bilo, is used to serve kava and yaqona. The Samoan name for this cup is tauau or generally, ipu tau ʻava ('ava cup). It is called "apu" in Hawaii.

The coconut shell cup used for distributing the 'ava in a ʻava ceremony is made from the half shell of a ripe coconut that has been cleaned and polished. It is sometimes ornamented with different designs, and after early European contact it was sometimes decorated with inlaid silver.
