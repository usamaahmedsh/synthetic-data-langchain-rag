A strawberry festival is an event and celebration in many towns in North America.  In most instances, areas around these towns are, or have been, deeply involved in the production and marketing of strawberries, and the festivals are usually held in late spring around the time of the strawberry harvest.  Such festivals generally involve a parade and other community events and the consumption of the fruit, and may attract visitors from other places.
