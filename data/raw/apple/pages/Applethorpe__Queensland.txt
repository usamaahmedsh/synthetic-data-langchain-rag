The area was originally called Roessler after an early German settler, but the name was changed to Applethorpe (reflecting the apple orchards in the district) in 1915, as part of the anti-German sentiment during World War I.
In 1910, approval for establishment of the Four Mile Stanthorpe School was given and the school was opened on 14 September 1911. However, from November 1911 to November 1916, it was called Roesseller State School. However, like the town itself, in 1917 the school name was changed to Applethorpe State School due to anti-German sentiment.
In December 1910, the Roessler railway station was established at the 200 miles (320 km) point between Thulimbah and Stanthorpe. In September 1916, it was renamed Applethorpe railway station due to anti-German sentiment.
