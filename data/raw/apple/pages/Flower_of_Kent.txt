The Flower of Kent is a green cultivar of cooking apple. It is pear-shaped, mealy, and sub-acid, and of generally poor quality by today's standards. As its name suggests, this cultivar likely originated from Kent, England.
Though now largely gone from commercial cultivation, a handful of Flower of Kent trees remain.  Most, if not all, are said to descend from trees at Newton's Woolsthorpe Manor, and nearly all that exist descend from a single tree in East Malling, Kent. One such tree is located in the President's Garden at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, although it is known to have produced only one apple. Currently, this cultivar remains available at Antique Apple Orchard Inc. in Sweet Home, Oregon.
According to the story, this is the apple Isaac Newton saw falling to the ground from its tree, inspiring his laws of universal gravitation.
The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale contains an example, listed as "Isaac Newton's Tree" (1948-729).
