== Cultivation and uses ==
This is one of the most commonly cultivated species, grown as an ornamental plant for its flowers. It is best grown in deep soils that receive and hold a lot of water during the growing season and should be left to grow in the same place without disturbance for many years. Plants require full sun. They also make good container plants. The species is hardy to USDA zone 6 or −10 °C (14 °F) if the bulb is protected. Propagation is by division or seeds. Seedlings will flower in their third or fourth year.
