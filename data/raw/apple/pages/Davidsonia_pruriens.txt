Davidsonia pruriens, also known as ooray, Davidson's plum, or Queensland Davidson's plum, is a medium-sized rainforest tree of northern Queensland, Australia.
The leaves are large and compound. The edible dark burgundy colored fruit is produced in large clusters from the branches or the trunk, depending on the type. There are at least two distinct forms, with a suggestion that one of these is an undescribed species.
The indigenous name - ooray - is being increasingly used by growers and processors.
