Prunus pusilliflora (syn. Cerasus pusilliflora), is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to Yunnan in China, where it is widespread, and is sometimes cultivated. A shrub or small tree reaching 3 to 10 m (10 to 33 ft), it is typically found in forested mountain slopes and ravines, at elevations from 1,400 to 2,100 m (4,600 to 6,900 ft). A chromosome-scale genome assembly study showed that it has better resistance to Colletotrichum viniferum, Phytophthora capsici, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato than does Prunus avium, sweet cherry.
