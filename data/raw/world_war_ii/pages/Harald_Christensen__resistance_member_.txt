On 30 June 1945 at Vestre Kirkegaard a memorial service was held for him, as well as for the killed member of the resistance Estvan Svend Aage Wehlast.
On 29 August Christensen and 105 other victims of the occupation were given a state funeral in the memorial park founded at the execution and burial site in Ryvangen where he was executed. Bishop Hans Fuglsang-Damgaard led the service with participation from the royal family, the government and representatives of the resistance movement.
In 1950 his remains were moved, prior to the official inauguration of the Ryvangen Memorial Park on 5 May 1950. Remarkably, a second resistance member to also be removed from the memorial park was the above-mentioned Estvan Svend Aage Wehlast.
The official list of resistance members buried in Ryvangen does not include Christensen, nor Wehlast.
