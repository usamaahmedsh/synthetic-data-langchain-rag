Forward Operating Base Khar Nikah or more simply FOB Khar Nikah is a former Forward Operating Base in Afghanistan operated by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) under Operation Herrick (OP H).
It was formerly known as FOB Keenan, but renamed to Khar Nikah to increase local mental ownership.
Khar Nikah is a phrase in Pashto that refers to a marriage or wedding ceremony. It combines the Pashto word "nikah" (marriage) with the word "khar" which can mean "donkey" and is used as an insult, suggesting a forced or undesirable marriage.
