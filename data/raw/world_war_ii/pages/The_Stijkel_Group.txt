The Stijkel Group (Dutch: Stijkelgroep) was a Dutch resistance group that fought the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during the Second World War. They operated between 1940 and 1942.
In April 1941, forty-three men and four women of the Stijkel Group were betrayed and captured.  Thirty-two were executed in Berlin following a secret trial before a German military court.  The others were sentenced to prison camps.  Following the war, those who had been executed were re-interred in Westduin Cemetery in The Hague, and the present monument was erected.
