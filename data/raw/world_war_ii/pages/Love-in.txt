A love-in is a peaceful public gathering focused on meditation, love, music, sex and/or use of recreational drugs. The term was coined by Los Angeles radio comedian Peter Bergman, creator of comedy group The Firesign Theater, who also hosted the first such event on Easter, 26 March 1967 in Elysian Park.


== The term ==
The term love-in has been interpreted in varying manners, but is often connected to protesting local, social or environmental issues. Such protests were often held in opposition to the Vietnam War. As such, love-ins are largely considered a staple of the 1960s hippie counterculture.
More recently the term is occasionally used figuratively to describe a situation in which people shower praise on one another in excess.
