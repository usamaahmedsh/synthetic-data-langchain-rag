== Serbia ==
Russian general Isaev arrived in Serbia with 1,500 Russian troops on 19 June [O.S. 7 June] 1807. He fought alongside Serb troops, with interruptions, until 10 July 1809. Other Russian agents in Serbia were cavalry captain Ilija Novokršteni who joined the Serbian command (present since June 1806), diplomat Filippo Paulucci (June 1807) who was to ensure Russian alliance, diplomat Konstantin Rodofinikin (July 1807) who focused on internal affairs, and cavalry general Joseph Cornelius O'Rourke (1809) and major Cukatov (1810), who joined operations.
Isaev moved with his troops from Wallachia and crossed the Danube into the Serbian-held Kladovo and Brza Palanka where he met up with Serbian supreme commander Karađorđe. They were accompanied on 21 June [O.S. 9 June] 1807 by two Russian generals, 18 officers, and many artillerists. The combined forces went and rescued the surrounded Serb troops at Malajnica, decisively defeating Mulla Pasha of Vidin who however managed to escape. Karađorđe was very impressed with the Olonets Regiment that participated. Isaev took part in the signing of the so-called "Paulucci's Convention" (10 July 1807), an unratified treaty regarding Russian-Serbian relations and aid in the uprising.
Next, Isaev was stationed in the Timok region where he monitored the Ottoman army of the Sanjak of Vidin, then wintered in Russian-held Oltenia. He returned to Serbia around Kladovo on 14 July [O.S. 2 July] 1809 with six battalions, two Cossack detachments, and 500 pandurs. He led an assault on the Ottoman army at Kladovo on 21 July [O.S. 9 July] 1809 but suffered great losses and retreated the next day. He died suddenly in Serbia on 26 August 1810.


== Legacy ==
Count A. F. Langeron said the following about the death of I. I. Isaev:

A smart, active, intelligent man, who commanded the troops well. The death of this general was a great loss for the army. He was one of those few generals whose courage and knowledge would be of great benefit to the fatherland.
