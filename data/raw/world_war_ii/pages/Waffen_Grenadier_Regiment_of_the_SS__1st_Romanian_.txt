During World War II, the Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the SS (1st Romanian) (German: Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS (Rumänisches Nr. 1)) was formed out of members of the Romanian 4th Infantry Division which had been captured in Hungary by the Germans after Romania signed a ceasefire with the Soviet Union.
The regiment also included members of the Fascist Iron Guard, which always had a close relationship with the SS. It was attached to the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps and fought on the River Oder front until the beginning of March 1945. It was then transferred to the eastern approaches to Berlin where it was destroyed during the Soviet Berlin offensive which was launched on 16 April 1945. Most of the unit survived and escaped westward into captivity.

It was hoped by the Germans that this unit would form the basis of a Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Romanian) and to that end a second regiment was formed. The Waffen Grenadier Regiment of the SS (2nd Romanian) began forming at Döllersheim in Austria. However, by this stage in the war there was no fuel for vehicles, little food, and no weapons or ammunition for the new regiment. In April 1945, the two battalions which had been formed were used as construction battalions.
