Camp Roberts is a California National Guard post in central California, located on both sides of the Salinas River in Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties, now run by the California Army National Guard. It was opened in 1941 and is named after Corporal Harold W. Roberts, a World War I Medal of Honor recipient. Nearby communities include San Miguel, Heritage Ranch (Lake Nacimiento), Oak Shores (Lake Nacimiento), and Bradley, all unincorporated. The nearest incorporated city is Paso Robles.  Camp Roberts is roughly 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Fort Hunter Liggett.
Camp Roberts is host to annual training for California Army National Guard units and the British Army.
As of 2014, Camp Roberts is undergoing major renovations, including demolition of World War II-era barracks. Demolition of the World War II-era structures facing US Route 101 began in 2012. To contain the hazardous materials from the demolished barracks, a large hazardous waste landfill was created.


== History ==
Under the leadership Lieutenant Colonel Oliver Martson the camp was built in 1940, as a World War II training center. At its peak it housed 45,000 troops in 1945. The camp opened as the  Camp Nacimiento Replacement Training Center, but the name was changed, to honor Corporal Harold W. Roberts, a tank driver in World War I who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. For World War II 436,000 Infantry and Field Artillery troops were trained at the camp. Camp Roberts was one of the largest training camps during World War II. At the camp a 750 bed Army hospital was built to serve the troops. The camp also held prisoners of war. German and Italian prisoners of war were held at the camp during WW2. Italian prisoners of war were given the option to volunteer to work in special Italian Service Unit and work at Camp Roberts' 10th Italian Quartermaster Service Company.  After the war the camp was inactive, but for the few National Guard and Army Reserve troops that used it for summer training. In 1950 for the Korean War the camp became active again.  After the Korean War the camp was inactive again. The US Army's Combat Development Experimental Command began to operate the camp for weapons testing. The US Navy used the vast camp training gunners with live fire. In April 1970 the US Army closed the army camp. The camp was turned over to the California National Guard in 1971 for a training center.
