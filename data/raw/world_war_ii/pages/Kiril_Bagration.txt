Prince Kiril Bagration (Georgian: კირილე ბაგრატიონი, Kirile Bagrationi; Russian: Кири́лл Алекса́ндрович Багратио́н, Kirill Aleksandrovich Bagration)  (1749 – 19 April 1828) was an Imperial Russian general and official of Georgian origin, descended from the royal line of the Bagrationi-Mukhraneli of Kartli. He was a grandson of King Jesse of Kartli and uncle of General Pyotr Bagration of the Napoleonic Wars fame.


== Career ==
Prince Kiril Bagration was a son of Prince Alexander, a natural son of King Jesse of Kartli. Kiril was nine years old, when Alexander fled the unfavorable political climate in Kartli and joined his émigré relatives in Russia in 1759. Kiril and his elder brother, Ivan, following their father's suit, entered the Russian service. Kiril enlisted in the Pskov Carabinier Regiment as a wachtmeister in 1767 and fought in the 1768–74 Russo-Turkish War which he ended as a captain. From 1776 to 1777, he took part in bringing the Crimean Tatars to submission and eventually represented the Crimean nobility at the court of the tsarina Catherine II. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1786, he was present at the siege and capture of Bender during the 1787–92 Russo-Turkish War and commanded a vanguard in General Wilhelm Derfelden's corps during the 1792 invasion of Poland. Bagration became a colonel in 1793 and enlisted in the Chuguyevsky Cossack Regular Regiment, which he accompanied in the Persian Expedition of 1796. He was promoted to major-general in 1797 and put in command of a jäger regiment, which was given his name in 1798.
In 1800, Prince Bagration resigned from military due to deteriorating health and was transferred to civil service as a pivy councilor. In this capacity, he attended the Moscow department of the Governing Senate and then was tasked with inspecting the Belorussian Governorate. In 1805 he was moved to the 7th Department of the Senate and remained its member until his death in Moscow at the age of 78 on 19 April 1828. He was buried at the necropolis of the Georgian nobility at the Donskoy Monastery.
