Following the creation of SOE's F Section in the summer of 1940, it became eventually apparent that French anti-German sentiment was not as simple as once thought and effectively fell into two camps - those who supported de Gaulle and those who did not. To keep these camps apart, RF Section (pro-Gaullists) was mooted in late 1940 and came into being in early 1941. By May 1941 it was established at 1, Dorset Square and initially headed by Capt Eric Piquet-Wicks.  The complexities of the interplay between F and RF Sections and between RF and BCRA is covered in MRD Foot's book "The SOE in France". The operations listed below are effectively, jointly mounted by SOE-RF and BCRA with the former supplying, or access to, the materiél (flights, wireless-sets, weapons, training etc.) with the BCRA supplying personnel. The men and women who made their ways to London to join BCRA came from a wide background both in terms of profession and location. To assume they were French and lately of the remnants of the French military is an over-simplification - civilians as well as foreign-born pro-French sympathisers make up a notable proportion of the agents prepared to fight for France.

Section RF of the Special Operations Executive. 

Pierre Tillet's cited work forms the basis of this summary, this is hereby acknowledged. Where missions are logged as RF/BCRA, they are detailed below and augmented with citations from predominantly French sources. Uncited detail by default stems from Tillet's work.
The Service Historique de la Defense has produced an index of BRCA agents, this covers some 16400 agents' dossiers. From the work of Tillet, most of these agents must have performed their acts of resistance in situ since relatively few are recorded travelling into France from abroad
Separating F-Section 's and RF Section's operations becomes difficult as both increase in activity and share some resources including agents - these lists are by no means definitive in this regard.
These operations are almost entirely mounted as joint operations between RF-Section and BCRA. A brief explanation of this relationship follows.
Many of the links are in French.
