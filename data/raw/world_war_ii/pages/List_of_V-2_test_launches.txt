The list of V-2 test launches identifies World War II launches of the A4 rocket (renamed V-2 in 1944).  Test launches were made at Peenemünde Test Stand VII, Blizna V-2 missile launch site and Tuchola Forest using experimental and production rockets fabricated at Peenemünde and at the Mittelwerk. Post-war launches were performed in Germany at Cuxhaven, in the USSR at Kapustin Yar, in the USA at White Sands Proving Grounds, Cape Canaveral, and on the USS Midway during Operation Sandy.

== Operation Backfire launches near Cuxhaven ==
For Operation Backfire, the British collected from Mittlwerk and areas under British control sufficient parts to assemble a small number of V-2s to be launched by German personnel so Allies could learn of the handling and launching of the rockets. The final launch was a demonstration for representatives of the United States, USSR, France, and the press.


== Launches of captured V-2 rockets in the United States after 1945 ==

The Upper Atmosphere Research Panel performed experiments on US flights of V-2s.


== Launches of V2 by the Soviet Union ==
The USSR captured the V-2 production facility at Nordhausen and assembled their own V-2s. Subsequently, they moved the equipment to the USSR and developed their own copy, the missile R-1.
