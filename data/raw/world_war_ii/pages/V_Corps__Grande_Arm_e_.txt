The V Corps of the Grande Armée was a French military corps unit that existed during the Napoleonic Wars. The corps was originally formed in 1805 and was reorganized several times until it was dissolved in 1814.


== History ==
From 1805–1807, the corps composed mostly of French troops, and was commanded by Marshals Jean Lannes, Édouard Mortier, François Joseph Lefebvre, and André Masséna as well as Général de Division Anne Jean Marie René Savary.


=== Polish Corps d'Armée ===
In 1812, the V Corps was made up entirely of Polish soldiers from the Duchy of Warsaw under the command of General Józef Poniatowski. It was one of several non-French corps of the Grande Armée and at its peak consisted of around 36,000 soldiers. The corps took part in Napoleon's invasion of Russia and fought in the Battle of Smolensk and the Battle of Borodino.
The corps suffered heavy casualties during the retreat, but managed to reach Warsaw and was later reinforced with new recruits. In 1813, the corps was sent to Saxony, passing Bohemia. The corps was temporary disbanded with the remaining troops and Poniatowski reassigned to the VIII Corps.


=== Revival ===
After the disastrous Russian campaign, the V Corps was rebuilt in Magdeburg from newly formed French units in the spring of 1813. These troops were under the command of General Jacques Lauriston. Participating in the War of the Sixth Coalition the corps was disbanded again after Napoleon's abdication.


== Organization ==
The V Corps varied in strength and organization. In the beginning of each campaign it had:

14,000 French in 1805
18,000 French in 1806–1807
36,000 Polish in 1812
20,000 French in 1813
