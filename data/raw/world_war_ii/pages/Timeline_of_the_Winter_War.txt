The timeline of the Winter War is a chronology of events leading up to, culminating in, and resulting from the Winter War. The war began when the Soviet Union attacked Finland on 30 November 1939 and it ended 13 March 1940.


== Prelude ==

7 November 1917: Bolshevik revolution breaks out in Russia.
6 December 1917: Finland declares independence from Russia.
27 January 1918: Finnish Civil War between German-supported White Guards and Soviet-supported Red Guards.

15 May 1918: Finnish Civil War ends with a victory by the White Guards under C.G.E. Mannerheim.
23 January 1919: The Finnish population in Ingria rebels from Soviet Russia, creating the Republic of North Ingria, which seeks to join Finland. The short-lived state is later reincorporated into Russia.
21 April 1919: Finnish armed nationalist volunteers launch the Aunus expedition, attempting to annex Karelia to Finland. Due to lack of significant support from the local population and Soviet resistance, the expedition was ultimately defeated. Finnish historiography does not consider these expeditions and rebellions to be wars, while Russian historiography considers them as military interventions, calling them the "First Soviet–Finnish War."
17 July 1919: Finland adopts a democratic constitution.
14 October 1920: Soviet Russia and Finland sign the Treaty of Tartu, which provides for mutual de jure recognition and a settlement of the border. The harbor of Petsamo is ceded to Finland in exchange for the parishes of Repola and Porajärvi, which had briefly seceded from Russia to Finland previously.
October 1921: The East Karelian Uprising begins against Soviet Russia. Armed Finnish volunteers soon join to take part in the fighting. The uprising is ultimately defeated; the rebels cross the border to refuge in Finland.
21 January 1932: The Soviet Union and Finland negotiate a non-aggression pact.
24 August 1939: Russo-German non-aggression pact signed. Secret protocol places the Baltic region and Finland within the Soviet Union's sphere of interest.

10 October 1939: Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty signed.
11–12 October 1939: Finnish delegation meets V.M. Molotov and J.V. Stalin in Moscow, and receives demands of concessions. The Soviet demands include the secession of territory in the Karelian Isthmus, islands in the Gulf of Finland, and the Rybachy Peninsula, as well as the lease of a naval base at Hanko. In return, they offer to secede the municipalities of Repola and Porajärvi, making up twice as much territory as their demands of Finland. The offer divides the Finnish government, who ultimately reject it.
23 October 1939: The Finnish make a counteroffer, offering the town of Terijoki, much smaller than Soviet demands.
31 October 1939: Molotov makes a speech before the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, publicly announcing the Soviet demands and offers.
13 November 1939: The Finnish delegation returns home, ending negotiations.
