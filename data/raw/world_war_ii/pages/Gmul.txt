Gmul ('Recompense') was a short-lived secret unit created in the Jewish Brigade in 1945 at the end of World War II to identify and kill Germans, particularly SS members, who had taken part in atrocities against Jews. In their three months of operations, they assassinated 100 to 200 Nazi war criminals. Eventually, the British, having received complaints about the disappearances, forced an end to the killings.
