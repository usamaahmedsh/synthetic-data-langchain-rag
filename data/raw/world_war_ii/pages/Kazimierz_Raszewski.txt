Kazimierz Raszewski (29 February 1864 – 14 January 1941) was a lieutenant general of the Polish Army.


== Early life ==
Raszewski was born 29 February 1864 in a small village called Jasień near Poznań (Czempiń Municipal), in the Province of Posen in the Kingdom of Prussia. Kazimierz was the second son of a szlachta (Polish landed gentry) Ignacy Raszewski and Józefa Koczorowska. His great grandfather, Kazimierz Turno, was a general of the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw.
In 1827, he started attending the Real School in Poznań. He later moved to the Saint Mary Magdalene School. In 1884, he finished school in Bolesławiec.


== Military career ==
He started his military career in 1885 by joining the 2. Schlesische Husaren-Regiment Nr. 6 in Prudnik. The commander of the Regiment in Prudnik was lieutenant Rosenberg, a friend of Raszewski's father with whom he served in the Husaren-Regiment Nr. 1 in Milicz. Due to Raszewski's Polish descent, he was being mocked by other soldiers. After many years, in his autobiography, he stated that he wouldn't become an officer without the support he received from Rosenberg while in Prudnik.
After graduating from military school in Nysa in 1887, he came back to Prudnik as a second lieutenant and became the commander of the platoon. In 1892, he married Olga Luchs. The couple had a son Lambert (born 1893) and a daughter Izabela (1894–1917).
In 1894, he was moved to 1. Schlesische Husaren-Regiment Nr. 4 in Oława. In 1913, he joined the Husaren-Regiment Nr. 16 in Schleswig. During World War I, he served on Western and Eastern Front.
In 1918, he joined the Armia Wielkopolska to fight in the Greater Poland uprising. He later participated in the Polish–Soviet War.
In 1932 he published his memoirs of World War One and the Polish-Soviet War.
