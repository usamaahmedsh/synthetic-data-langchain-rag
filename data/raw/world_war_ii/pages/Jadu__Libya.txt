Jadu was the main trade town of the Nafusa, and the first stop on the caravan roads leading from Tripoli to the Fezzan, the Wagadu empire, Gao and the Kanem Empire. The town of Djado in modern-day Niger was likely founded by Ibadi merchants from Jadu.

Giado, as it was then known by its Italian name, was the site of an Italian concentration camp during the Second World War. In 1942, about 2,600 Jews and other people, who were considered undesirables by Italians, were rounded up throughout Libya and sent to the Giado camp.
564 died from typhus and other privations. The camp was liberated by the British Army in January 1943.

Jadu's council rejected the draft 2017 constitution.
