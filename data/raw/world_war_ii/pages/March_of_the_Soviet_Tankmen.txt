The "March of the Soviet Tankmen" (Russian: Марш советских танкистов, romanized: Marsh sovetskikh tankistov) is a 1939 Soviet military march song composed by the Pokrass brothers and with lyrics by Boris Savelyevich Laskin (Борис Савельевич Ласкин), whose debut was in the 1939 movie Tractor Drivers, in which the role of Klim Yarko is played by Nikolai Kryuchkov. Later the song was used in World War II short titled "Fascist Jackboots Shall Not Trample Our Motherland" by Ivanov-Vano (1941). Valery Dunaevsky commented that the song "was full of fighting spirit" in his book A Daughter of the "Enemy of the People" (2015).
