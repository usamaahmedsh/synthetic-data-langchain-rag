Undersøkelseskommisjonen av 1945 was a commission appointed by the Parliament of Norway in 1945 and chaired by Norwegian politician Gustav Heiberg, given the task to investigate the role of the three branches of power: the Norwegian Parliament, Government and Supreme Court, as well as the Administrative Council in 1940.  The six reports with nine annexes published by the commission in 1946 and 1947, are regarded as an important source on the events in 1940.
