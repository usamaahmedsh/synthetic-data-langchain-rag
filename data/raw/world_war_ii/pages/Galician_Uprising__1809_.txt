The Galician Uprising of 1809 was a Polish armed uprising against the Austrian Empire led by Piotr Strzyżewski during the Polish-Austrian War. The rebellion ended with an Insurgent military victory.


== Background ==
The territory of Galicia has been under the Austrian Control since 1772.  The creation of Duchy of Warsaw led to the idea of an armed uprising being more popular among the population.

  
After the Battle of Raszyn the Austrian forces captured Warsaw, forcing Józef Poniatowski to retreat and assume defensive positions on The Vistula River. The Austrian forces failed to defeat Poniatowski's defences, which allowed his army to use that situation to capture many cities (such as: Kock, Lublin, Sandomierz and Zamość), including Lviv, which became the headquarters of the Provisional Central Military Government of Galicia.
