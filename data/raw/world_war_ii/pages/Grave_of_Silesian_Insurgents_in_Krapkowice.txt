The Grave of Silesian Insurgents (Polish: Mogiła Powstańców Śląskich), situated in the municipal cemetery in Krapkowice, is a mass grave of Silesian Insurgents fallen in the Battle of Annaberg during the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921.


== History ==
In 1945, an exhumation was carried out of the remains of Silesian insurgents buried in an unmarked grave dating back to 1921 at the cemetery in Krapkowice. A new mass grave was established to the left of the main entrance of the municipal cemetery by Staszica Street; becoming the final resting place for the remains of 14 Silesian insurgents who perished during the German offensive on St. Anne's Mountain in May 1921, in the Battle of Annaberg during the Third Silesian Uprising. That same year, in 1945, a stone monument was erected at the site to commemorate the fallen insurgents.
On 22 June 1987, the grave was entered into the register of historic monuments of the Opole Voivodeship. In 2005, the monument was renovated. In the process, the inscription on it was altered. The grave is included in the official list of sites required to visit in order to receive a commemorative PTTK badge celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Silesian Uprisings. Per tradition, ahead of All Saints' Day, the monument is tended to by the pupils of the Public Primary School No. 1 in Krapkowice.
