The Chuhatsu (中発) or 13m landing craft was a type of landing craft, used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. It was a smaller version of the Daihatsu Class, with a bow ramp that was lowered to disembark cargo upon riding up onto the beach.
It was utilised by the Imperial Japanese Navy as a liberty and supply boat for cruisers, and as a lighter for transporting aircraft.
