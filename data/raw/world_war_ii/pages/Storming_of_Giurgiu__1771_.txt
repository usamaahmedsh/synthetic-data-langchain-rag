The Storming of Giurgiu was a military storm  undertaken by the Russians on August 7, 1771, against the city of Giurgiu. The storm was part of the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), and resulted in an Ottoman victory.


== Storming ==
On August 7, General Essen commanded a Russian attack on the Ottoman fortress of Giurgiu during the Russo-Turkish War. Three assault columns led by Generals Czartoryski, Olsuf'ev, and Gudovich attempted to capture the fortress. The lack of adequate artillery support and an insufficient number of siege ladders hindered the assault. 
The Russians were repelled by the fire of the Ottoman defenders and pikemen, who pushed the attackers into the moat. The commanders of all three assault columns, Czartoryski, Olsuf'ev, and Gudovich—were wounded, with General Czartoryski suffering fatal injuries. Russian forces sustained losses amounting to about one-third of their troops and were forced to retreat. The Turks did not pursue them.


== Aftermath ==
The last Battle of Giurgiu during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) was a battle on 12 September 1771, which resulted in an Ottoman victory.
