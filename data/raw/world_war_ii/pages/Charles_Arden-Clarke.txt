Sir Charles Noble Arden-Clarke  (25 July 1898 – 16 December 1962) was a British colonial administrator who served in several territories under British rule, including Bechuanaland, Basutoland, Sarawak, Brunei, the Gold Coast, and Ghana. He is particularly noted for his role as the last Governor of the Gold Coast and the first Governor-General of independent Ghana.


== Early life and education ==
Arden-Clarke was born on 25 July 1898 and educated at Rossall School in Lancashire, England.


== Colonial Service ==


=== Bechuanaland Protectorate ===
Arden-Clarke was educated at Rossall School. From 1937 to 1942, Arden-Clarke served as Resident Commissioner of the Bechuanaland Protectorate (now Botswana). His tenure coincided with tensions between the British authorities and  Tshekedi Khama, the regent of the Bamangwato people.


==== Basutoland ====
In August 1942, he was appointed Resident Commissioner of Basutoland (modern-day Lesotho), a position he held until November 1946.


===== Sarawak =====
In 1946, following the cession of Sarawak by the Brooke dynasty to the British Crown, Arden-Clarke became the first  Governor of the new colony. His appointment coincided with the rise of the Anti-cession Movement, a local resistance to British rule. Opposition to cession remained strong during his administration, and the movement later culminated in the assassination of his successor, Duncan Stewart, in 1949.


====== Gold Coast and Ghana ======
In August 1949, Arden-Clarke was appointed Governor of the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana), residing at  Fort Christiansborg Castle. He played a significant role in the transition toward independence. On 12 February 1951, he authorised the release of Kwame Nkrumah from prison in James Fort, an act which helped to facilitate political dialogue and reduce tensions.
When the Gold Coast achieved independence as Ghana in 1957, Arden-Clarke became the country's first  Governor-General of Ghana, representing Queen Elizabeth II. His working relationship with Nkrumah and his relatively conciliatory approach are often credited with contributing to a relatively peaceful independence process.


== Later life and death ==
Arden-Clarke retired from colonial service after leaving Ghana in 1957. He died on 16 December 1962, aged 64.


== Honours ==
Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG)
Knight of Grace of the Order of St John (GCStJ)
