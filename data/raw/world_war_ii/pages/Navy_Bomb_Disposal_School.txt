The Navy Bomb Disposal School, was a World War II era U.S. naval training installation built on American University property in Washington, D.C.


== Environmental impact ==
During World War II, American University allowed the U.S. Navy to use part of its campus for bomb disposal training. In 1993, a construction worker stumbled upon some of the buried munitions. This led to major cleanup efforts in the 1990s and 2000s (decade) on the site, which included a corner of the university and several neighboring residences.
