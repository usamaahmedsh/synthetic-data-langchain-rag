Southern Occupied Territories Administrative Guidelines (Japanese: 南方占領地行政実施要領) was a document issued by the Imperial Japanese Army on 20 November 1941, outlining administrative policies for territories occupied by Japan in Southeast Asia during World War II.


== Overview ==
The document provided instructions on how to govern occupied territories, particularly regarding the local population's political activity and attitudes toward the Japanese military. The guidelines emphasized encouraging confidence in the Imperial Army among the local inhabitants while preventing the premature inducement of independence movements.


== Policy Instructions ==
One of the key directives reads in the original Japanese:
> "原住土民ニ對シテハ皇軍ニ對スル信倚觀念ヲ助長セシムル如ク指導シ其ノ獨立運動ハ過早ニ誘發セシムルコトヲ避クルモノトス"
"Guide the indigenous peoples so as to foster trust in the Imperial Army, and avoid provoking their independence movements prematurely."
This passage instructs that the indigenous population should be guided to foster confidence in the Imperial Army, while ensuring that independence movements are not prematurely induced.
The document also outlines policies on utilizing existing local administrative structures, controlling strategic resources, managing transportation and communication infrastructure, regulating trade, and handling foreign nationals and resident Japanese.


== Historical Significance ==
The guidelines demonstrate that the proclaimed purpose of Japan's occupation—often described as the "liberation of Asia"—was subordinated in practice to military and strategic control. The directive concerning independence movements shows that Japanese authorities actively sought to control nationalist activity while maintaining an appearance of civil administration.
