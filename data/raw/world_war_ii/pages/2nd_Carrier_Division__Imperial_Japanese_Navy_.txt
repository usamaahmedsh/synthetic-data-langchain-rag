The Second Carrier Division (第二航空戦隊, Dai Ni Kōkū sentai, Ni Kōsen) was an aircraft carrier unit of the Imperial Japanese Navy's First Air Fleet.  At the beginning of the Pacific Campaign of World War II, the Second Carrier Division consisted of the fleet carriers Sōryū and Hiryū.  Both carriers were sunk at the Battle of Midway in June 1942 and were replaced by Jun'yō and Ryūjō.
