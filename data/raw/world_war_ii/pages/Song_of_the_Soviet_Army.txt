The "Song of the Soviet Army", also known as the "Song of the Russian Army" or by the refrain's opening line "Invincible and Legendary", is a Soviet patriotic song written during the end of World War II. Its performance has been done by numerous artists, especially by the Alexandrov Ensemble. The original 1945 version is triumphal in tune, with its brass fanfares and ecstatic chords extended upward with the aid of trumpets, as part of the V-E Day celebrations. That arrangement by A. Alexandrov is very much in the tradition of final choruses in 19th-century Italian grand opera, and shows how he originally envisaged this composition. There are many versions of the song.
Besides the original lyrics in Russian, the song has been performed in German, Hungarian, and Chinese.
