The Iraqi opposition (Arabic: المعارضة العراقية-Muʻaraḍatu l-‘Irāqiyyah) was a large political and militant structure represented by a diverse de facto coalition with the common goal of overthrowing Saddam Hussein.


== Structure ==
In the south of Iraq, the opposition was dominated by Shia Arabs, while in the north, it was dominated by Kurds, mostly Sunni. In Baghdad, there was many Arab opposition groups. Large groups included the Iraqi National Congress, Kurdish groups such as KDP, PUK, IMK, AAI, as well as the Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy which aimed at restoring the Kingdom of Iraq, and the Iraqi National Accord, and the Iran-backed Shia groups such as the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and Islamic Dawa Party, also the Democratic July 14 Movement coalition, pro-Assad Ba'athists, and the Iraqi Communist Party and its military wing Al-Ansar.
In February 2003, the Bush administration fell apart with the Iraqi opposition, its closest ally.
