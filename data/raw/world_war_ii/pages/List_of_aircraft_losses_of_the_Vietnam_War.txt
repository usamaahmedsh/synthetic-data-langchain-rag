During the Vietnam War, thousands of U.S. aircraft were lost to antiaircraft artillery (AAA), surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and fighter interceptors (MiG)s. The great majority of U.S. combat losses in all areas of Southeast Asia were to AAA. The Royal Australian Air Force also flew combat and airlift missions in South Vietnam, as did the South Vietnamese Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF). Among fixed-wing aircraft, more F-4 Phantoms were lost than any other type in service with any nation.
The United States lost 578 Ryan Model 147 Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (554 over Vietnam and 24 over China). More than 400 QH-50C/D UAVs were also lost.
There were about 11,846 U.S helicopters that served in the Vietnam War. The U.S records show 5,607 helicopter losses.
In total, the United States military lost in Vietnam almost 10,000 aircraft (3,744 planes, 5,607 helicopters and about 1,000 UAVs.
South Vietnam lost 1,018 aircraft and helicopters from January 1964 to September 1973. 877 Republic of Vietnam aircraft were captured at war's end (1975) Of the 2,750 aircraft and helicopters received by South Vietnam, only about 308 survived (240 flew to Thailand or US warships and 68 returned to the United States).
In total, the US, South Vietnam and Australia, lost about 12,800 aircraft, helicopters and UAVs.
North Vietnam lost 150 to 170 aircraft and helicopters.

All told, the U.S. Air Force flew 5.25 million sorties over South Vietnam, North Vietnam, northern and southern Laos, and Cambodia, losing 2,251 aircraft: 1,737 to hostile action, and 514 in accidents. 2,197 of the losses were fixed-wing, and the remainder rotary-wing. The USAF sustained approximately 0.4 losses per 1,000 sorties during the conflict, which compared favorably with a 2.0 rate in Korea and a 9.7 figure during World War II.
