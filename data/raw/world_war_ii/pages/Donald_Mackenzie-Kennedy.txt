Sir Henry Charles Donald Cleaveland Mackenzie-Kennedy  (1889 – 2 August 1965) was a British colonial administrator who was Governor of Nyasaland between 1939 and 1942, and 25th Governor of Mauritius from 5 July 1942 to 5 December 1948.
In 1930, Mackenzie-Kennedy was Chief Secretary of Northern Rhodesia. He was urged to deny the Ndola Welfare Association permission to meet, since mine owners might react unfavorably to an organization such as this being led by civil servants. In June 1935, he wrote to Sir Stewart Gore-Browne urging him to stand for election in Broken Hill, to Northern Rhodesia's legislative council, saying "Your duty is clear."
