The Canon de 16 de Vallière was a type of cannon designed by the French officer Jean-Florent de Vallière (1667–1759), Director-General of the Battalions and Schools of the Artillery. The 16-pounder gun was part of the Vallière system which was established in 1732 with the intention to reduce the variety of cannons to five calibers and the number of mortars to three calibers, to standardize their production, and to manufacture all new artillery pieces in France.
