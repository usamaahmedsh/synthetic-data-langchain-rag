The army, estimated at around 15,000 men, included Ottoman soldiers, Crimean Tatars, and detachments of local North Caucasian groups. The campaign aimed to reassert influence over Kabarda while Russia was engaged on other fronts of the ongoing war.
Several Kabardian leaders loyal to Russia, including Dzhankhot Tatarkhanov and Devlet Kasaev, requested military support against the approaching forces.
