The Füssen-Plansee work camp was a work camp that was attached to the Dachau concentration camp during World War II. It was situated in the Forelle Hotel, on the banks of the Plansee, an Austrian lake near the border of Bavaria. The occupants were principally government leaders (military, politicians, bureaucrats), imprisoned in early 1943 and released in 1945.
At least two beds were placed in each room and the facility was partially heated. The personnalités-otages - hostage persons had a library that was provided by the Red Cross.
