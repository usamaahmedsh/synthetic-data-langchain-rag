"Warszawianka 1831 roku", "La Varsovienne" ("The Varsovian of 1831") is a Polish patriotic song written by Casimir François Delavigne with music by Karol Kurpiński.


== History ==

The song was written in support of the November Uprising of 1830–1831. The French poet Casimir Delavigne was fascinated and inspired by the news of the uprising making its way to Paris and wrote the words, which were translated into Polish by the historian, journalist, and poet Karol Sienkiewicz (great-uncle of novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz). 
It contains several stylistic allusions to "La Marseillaise" in the lyrics e.g. Aux armes, citoyens (in "La Varsovienne": Polonais, à la baïonnette). The song was performed for the first time on 5 April 1831 at the National Theatre in Warsaw and immediately started to enjoy great popularity.
The song is sometimes confused with a later Polish revolutionary song of the same name (often referred to in Polish as "Warszawianka 1905 roku" or ‘the Varsovienne of 1905’, sometimes known in English as "Whirlwinds of Danger"), which had its music used for the 1936 Spanish anarchist song "To the Barricades". It is today the official march past of the Polish Armed Forces. In 1918, after the regaining of independence by Poland, it was considered among the candidates for the country's national anthem.
