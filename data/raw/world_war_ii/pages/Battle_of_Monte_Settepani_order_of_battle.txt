The Monte Settepani order of battle is a detailed list of the Austrian and French forces that fought in the Battle of Monte Settepani from 24 June to 7 July 1795. The combined forces of Habsburg Austria and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont attacked the Republican French army and compelled it to retreat to a more defensible position. There are no sources for a Sardinian order of battle for 1795, so only the Austrian and French armies are listed.
