==== Russian Civil War and the White movement ====
In January 1920, after surrender of the 5th Division, Giżycki joined the White movement guerrillas in Uriankhai. Sometime between c. 1920~1921 he moved to north-western Outer Mongolia and he joined baron Roman Ungern von Sternberg's army, the Asiatic Cavalry Division, as an officer and engineer. He also briefly became Ungern von Sternberg's political advisor and chief of engineer troop, which manufactured land mines, hand grenades, chemical warfare, etc.
Giżycki took part in Ungern's last campaign to against the Bolsheviks in Transbaikalia, participating in their march across the mountains separating Mongolia from Russia, their battles against the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Bolshevik forces, and their final retreat from near Ulan-Ude in Buryatia back to Mongolia, where near the Egiin Gol River the baron's exhausted army collapsed on 17–18 August 1921, and baron was betrayed by two Russian officers who handed him over to the Bolsheviks.
Giżycki together with part of the 2nd Brigade of Ungern's army, pursued by the Red Army, retreated fighting both the enemy and the elements from north-central Mongolia, south of Urga, and then through northern Gobi to Chinese Manchuria. There, like the rest of the officer corps of the 2nd Ungern's Brigade, he joined the Chinese forces and served as a military instructor in army of Zhang Zuolin; he was later employed as an engineer of the Chinese Eastern Railway.
In summer 1922, Giżycki joined the army of White Russian general Anatoly Pepelyayev.
