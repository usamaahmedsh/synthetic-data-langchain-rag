Operation Seagull was a British action during the Second World War to destroy several Nazi-controlled industrial targets including a smelter at Arendal, with the help of Kompani Linge agents from Norway.

On 10 February 1943 the Norwegian submarine HNoMS Uredd was transporting the six-man sabotage team to Bodø when she hit a minefield laid by the German minelayer Cobra and sank, killing all 35 crew and the 7 agents.
In 1987, King Olav V unveiled a memorial to those lost aboard the Uredd, located in Grensen.
