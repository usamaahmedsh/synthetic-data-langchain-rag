== History ==
The first battalion was raised at Trichinopoly in 1761 as the 1st Battalion of Coast Sepoys. The first four battalions were raised during the hostilities in the Carnatic in south India between 1761 and 1776. The numbers and titles of the battalions changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army and later of the Indian Army.
The regiment insignia is of a naval vessel, a galley. It was awarded to the 9th Madras Native Infantry in recognition of the readiness to serve overseas, after the battalion had fought in eight overseas campaigns by 1824.
