Oflag X-C was a German World War II prisoner-of-war camp for officers (Offizierlager) in Lübeck in northern Germany. The camp was located on the corner of Friedhofsallee and Vorwerkstrasse, close to Lübeck's border with the town of Schwartau (now Bad Schwartau), and is often cited as being located in Schwartau rather than Lübeck. It housed French, British, Polish and other Allied officers.

The camp was opened in June 1940 for French officers captured during the Battle of France. In June 1941 British and Commonwealth officers from the Battle of Crete and the North African Campaign arrived. During 1941 and 1942 many Allied air crews that had been shot down were taken to Lübeck, then later transferred to Oflag VI-B, Warburg In mid-1942 many Polish officers were relocated to the Oflag II-D camp. In early 1945 Polish Officers, inmates of Oflag II-D and Oflag II-C, were marched westwards and finally reached Oflag X-C. The camp was liberated on 2 May 1945 by troops of the British 2nd Army. Prisoners of war were repatriated during May 1945 (Operation Exodus).
