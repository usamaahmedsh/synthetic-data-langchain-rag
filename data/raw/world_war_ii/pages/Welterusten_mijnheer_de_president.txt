"Welterusten mijnheer de president" (Dutch: Sleep well, Mr. President) is a 1966 Dutch-language Dylanesque protest song, sung by Boudewijn de Groot. Like most of his other songs, it was co-written by songwriter Lennaert Nijgh. The music was composed by Boudewijn de Groot himself. The song is a protest against the war in Vietnam and the US president of the time, Lyndon B. Johnson and solidified De Groot as a protest singer.
