The Generation of Columbuses (Polish: Pokolenie Kolumbów, [pɔ.kɔˈlɛ.ɲɛ kɔˈlum.buf]), also known as the Generation of 1920, is a term denoting the generation of Poles who were born soon after Poland regained its independence in 1918, and whose entry into adulthood was marked by World War II. 
The term was coined by Roman Bratny in his 1957 novel Kolumbowie. Rocznik 20. Referring to Christopher Columbus, Bratny described the entire generation of Poles as the ones who "discovered Poland". The term is generally applied to young intelligentsia, but also includes all young people who, instead of living a traditional young adulthood, had to fight against foreign occupation and study at secret universities.
