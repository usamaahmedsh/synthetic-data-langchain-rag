During the Polish–Soviet War fought from February 1919 to October 1920 (ended by armistice in March 1921) between Soviet Russia and the Second Polish Republic – in the aftermath of World War I in Europe – the Polish order of battle included broad disposition of personnel, strength, organization, and command structure.
In late 1920, the Polish Army had a total of 23 infantry divisions and nine cavalry brigades. Each infantry division had two brigades, each one having three regiments. Frequently, the infantry divisions were divided for specific tasks, with the resulting brigade-sized formations being called 'groups'. Larger ad hoc formations of more than a single division were called operational groups (Grupa operacyjna) rather than corps.

The numbering of the large infantry units in August 1920 was then as follows: 1st-18th Infantry Divisions, 1st and 2nd Lithuanian–Belarusian Divisions, the (21st) Mountain Division, the (22nd) Volunteer Division.
