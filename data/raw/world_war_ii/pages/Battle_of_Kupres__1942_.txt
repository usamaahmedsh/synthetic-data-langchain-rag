The Battle of Kupres (Croatian: Bitka za Kupres) was fought in 1942 during World War II in the Independent State of Croatia, between the forces of the Independent State of Croatia and the Yugoslav Partisans, in and around the town of Kupres in western Bosnia. The Partisans launched three concentrated attacks against the garrison of 1,500 men during the nights of 11/12 August, 14 August, and 19 August. Although outnumbered, the Black Legion, Croatian Home Guard, and local militia units successfully defended the town against several Partisan brigades.


== Background ==

In July 1942, the 2nd Proletarian Brigade moved on Kupres and, with the assistance of local Partisans, seized control over several villages in the vicinity. During the night of 4 August 1942 the Partisans attacked the town of Livno and captured it in the following days. The plan of the National Liberation Army Supreme Command, following the seizure of Livno, was to move the Proletarian Assault Brigades to Kupres, whose capture was vital for further actions in the valley of River Vrbas.
