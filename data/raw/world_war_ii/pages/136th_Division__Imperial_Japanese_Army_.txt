The 136th division formation was complete 31 July 1945, although the divisional numerical strength was only 60% of the required rifles, machine guns and cannons. To substitute for a lack of rifles, hand spears were issued. Also, divisional medical, chemical and biological warfare units were authorized but not formed. Finally, 136th division had a shortage of anti-tank explosive charges.
At the start of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria 9 August 1945 the division was improving fortifications at Benxi. Immediately orders to move were received, and majority of troops gathered in Shenyang. Also, Airborne (assault) battalion was sent to Wensheng District while two battalions of the 372nd infantry regiment were sent to Liaoyang.
Also, with the start of the invasion, the Aritomi Airborne (assault) battalion in Xinmin, Liaoning was assigned to 136th division. Also, 10 August 1945, the Mizunima detachment formerly belonging to 108th division was received and also ordered to Shenyang. 13 August 1945, the divisional fortifications plans were approved and 371st infantry regiment was sent back to Benxi to implement it.
The division was partially disarmed 19 August 1945, leaving about 15% of weapons for security duties. 20 August 1945, the division commander (Atsushi Nakayama) together with many other Japanese generals was kidnapped by the Red Army in Shenyang, resulting in his forced disappearance. The entire division was taken prisoner by Soviet Union forces 10 September 1945, and sent to labour camps.
Majority of the men of the 136th division were taken prisoner to the Soviet Union in September 1945 - February 1946 period and then were housed in several labour camps, in Siberia and Moscow.
