LG Q60 is a mid-range Android smartphone manufactured by LG Electronics, announced and released in February 2019, along with the LG K50 and LG K60, and a part of the LG Q series phones lineup. The phone was praised by some reviewers for its cheap price and AI-powered triple camera set-up.
Despite the initial reviews, the device received poor reviews from its users, who had high expectations for the device that was marketed as "premium" by LG. Reviews of the product cited the poor camera quality despite the presence of the triple camera set-up; many also noted the poor signal reception of the device, presumably due to the limited band support. Some reviewers also complained about the disappointingly slow Wi-Fi connection speeds.
