The Samsung Rugby Smart (SGH-i847) was a ruggedized Android smartphone manufactured by Samsung, for use on the AT&T Mobility network. The phone was 3.5G capable, but lacked LTE support. It was dust and vibration resistant, as well as waterproof to a depth of 1 meter (3.3 ft) for 30 minutes, earning the phone an ingress protection rating of IP67.


== Reception ==
The Samsung Rugby Smart was rated 4 stars out of 5 by PC Magazine and selected as their Editors' Choice. Phone Arena scored it 7½ out of 10. CNET rated the smartphone 3½ stars out of 5.


== Samsung Galaxy Rugby Pro ==
In October 2012, Samsung and AT&T announced the Samsung Galaxy Rugby Pro (SGH-i547), a successor to the Rugby Smart that includes similar durability and also ships with a scratch-resistant screen, something its previous model lacked. This rugged smartphone has passed military specification tests, like surviving blowing rain and sand, high humidity, and thermal shock. It comes with the push-to-talk features, but has LTE capability and a faster 1.5 GHz processor running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.
