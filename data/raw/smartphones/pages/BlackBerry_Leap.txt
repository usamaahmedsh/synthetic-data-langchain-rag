The BlackBerry Leap was a mid-range smartphone developed by BlackBerry Limited. Announced on March 3, 2015, at the Mobile World Congress with initial availability in April 2015, the Leap was a follow-on to the affordable Z3 model with a number of upgraded features. Upgrades included LTE support, higher-resolution display and cameras, higher-performance CPU and GPU, double the internal storage capacity, and an updated version of the BlackBerry 10 operating system. Size and weight increased very slightly from the Z3 model. The BlackBerry Leap was the final BlackBerry 10 device, as the BlackBerry Priv, the next BlackBerry flagship device, adopted  Android.
