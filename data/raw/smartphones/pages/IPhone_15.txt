The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the seventeenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were announced on September 12, 2023, during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, alongside the higher-priced flagship iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Pre-orders began on September 15, 2023, and the devices were made available on September 22, 2023.
Like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the 15 and 15 Plus are the first iPhones to replace the proprietary Lightning connector with USB-C to comply with European Union mandates. They are also the last iPhones to feature the diagonal rear cameras first introduced in the iPhone 13.
The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are the last iPhones to feature 6 GB of RAM and the mute switch, as they do not feature the Action Button, unlike the 15 Pro series and subsequent models. 
The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus were discontinued on September 9, 2025, following the announcement of the iPhone 17.


== History ==
In September 2021, the European Commission began considering a proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices in the European Union, including iPhones. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple would drop its proprietary Lightning connector by 2023. At the time of those claims, Apple was considering switching to USB-C due to the likelihood that the EU proposal would pass. The proposal was passed into law in October 2022, becoming the Radio Equipment Directive. Apple confirmed it would comply with the regulations later that month.
Two weeks prior to the formal introduction of the iPhone 15, it was announced that some of the devices which were made in India would for the first time be sold around the world on the launch day.


== Design ==

The iPhone 15 is the first major redesign since the iPhone 12, featuring rounder edges and a slightly curved display, and back glass. Both models are available in five colors: blue, pink, yellow, green and black. This makes it the first entry level iPhone since the iPhone XR to not ship with a Product Red variant at launch.


== Hardware ==


=== Display ===
The iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2556×1179 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 15 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2796×1290 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI. Both models have an improved typical brightness of up to 1,000 nits, a peak HDR brightness of up to 1,600 nits, and a peak outdoor brightness of up to 2,000 nits. The Dynamic Island feature, previously exclusive to iPhone 14 Pro, is now standard on iPhone 15, replacing the notch that was introduced in the iPhone X.


=== Charging and transfer speeds ===
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use USB-C with USB 2.0 transfer speeds (up to 480 Mb/s or 60 MB/s), compared to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max which have faster USB 3.2 Gen 2 transfer speeds (up to 10 Gb/s or 1.25 GB/s). The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, as well as the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models to use USB-C, as well as the first iPhones since the iPhone 5 to switch to a new charging port.


=== Video output ===
All iPhone 15 models have support for DisplayPort Alternate Mode over USB-C video output with HDR up to 4K resolution.
Previous iPhone models (from iPhone 5 until iPhone 14) had a maximum supported resolution of 1600 x 900 (slightly less than 1080p FHD) with the Lightning Digital AV Adapter due to technical constraints of the Lightning connector.


=== Battery ===
The iPhone 15 offers users up to 20 hours of video playback and up to 80 hours of audio playback, and the iPhone 15 Plus offers around 25 to 30% more, with up to 26 hours of video playback and up to 100 hours of audio playback. Starting with iPhone 15, iPhone allows users to limit the battery charge level, in order to help with natural battery aging over time.


== Software ==

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus launched with iOS 17 and is compatible with iOS 18. They are also compatible with iOS 26.
Apple announced that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus as well as its predecessors especially the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are not compatible with Apple Intelligence released with iOS 18.1 in October 2024.
iOS 17 brought many new features, including Contact Posters to personalize specific contacts and satellite Emergency SOS for emergency situations.
Consistent with the UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure regulation, it will continue to receive major software updates for a minimum of five years to at least 2028.

=== Overheating ===
Some owners claimed that their iPhone 15s were experiencing overheating issues, reportedly reaching temperatures as high as 47 °C (117 °F). Apple later stated that there were several reasons why the phones heat up, mainly hinting at a software issue. It was stated that it would be fixed with an update to iOS 17.0.3. The overheating issues were reported to persist after the update.
