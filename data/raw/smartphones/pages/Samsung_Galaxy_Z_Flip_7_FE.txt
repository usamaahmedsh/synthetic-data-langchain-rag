The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE (stylized as Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 FE) is a mid-range Android-based foldable smartphone developed and marketed by Samsung Electronics. Based on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, it is the cheaper model of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 with slightly downgraded specifications. It was officially announced on July 9, 2025, at the Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event held in Brooklyn, New York City, United States, alongside its basic model, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Galaxy Watch 8 series.
Both phones are very similar, but the FE model has minor specification downgrades in multiple areas: inner and outer screens, cameras, processor, memory, battery and connectivity.
