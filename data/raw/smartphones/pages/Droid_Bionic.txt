The Motorola Droid Bionic is an Android-based, 4G LTE-capable smartphone designed by Motorola. It was originally scheduled for release in Q2 2011 but was delayed, eventually being released on 8 September 2011.
It was introduced at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show along with the Motorola Atrix 4G, Motorola Xoom, and Motorola CLIQ 2.


== Reception ==
According to several sites there have been early complaints of a high-pitched whine during audio playback through the headphones. With the first officially available update, released to testers on 9 December 2011, this issue was solved.


== Software updates ==
Verizon Wireless announced the first firmware upgrade for the Droid Bionic, version 5.5.893, on 8 December 2011. The update was pushed to a limited test group on 9 December 2011, with plans to release it as an over-the-air (OTA) update package at a later date. The patch fixes many of the issues users reported at the Bionic's launch, with improvements including a smoother hand-off between 4G (LTE) and 3G (eHRPD/CDMA) data networks and software attenuation to eliminate the high-pitched transistor bleed ("hum") previously noticed in sound from the 3.5 mm jack.
On 19 December, some owners began receiving yet another OTA update to version 5.9.901. It was later provided as a download for manual installation. Later on, the changelog, or list of improvements was released.
A Motorola employee later confirmed the update was released to some by accident, and will be later released to all other DROID Bionic users soon.
In April 2012, an OTA update to version 5.9.902 was done, followed by one in June to version 5.9.905.
In June 2012 Ice Cream Sandwich builds 6.7.2231, 6.7.2233, 6.7.232 & 6.7.235, were pulled from Motorola's servers through cheesecake. It provided users with Android 4.0.4, with many features such as overclocking the CPU from 1.0 GHz to 1.2 GHz and including Webtop 3.0. However, the leaks included many bugs, such as the webtop launcher causing systemUI to crash, white text in the widgets menu (In custom launchers), and facelock not enabling correctly. Leak 6.7.235 will not let users FXZ back to OTA 5.9.902.
In October 2012, Verizon officially pushed Ice Cream Sandwich Android 4.0.4 out to users.
In April 2013, Verizon officially pushed Jelly Bean Android 4.1.2 out to users.

== Webtop ==
Similar to the Motorola Atrix 4G, it has the integrated Debian-based 'Webtop' application from Motorola. The Webtop application is launched when the phone is connected to the external display through Laptop dock or HD multimedia dock. In Webtop mode, offering similar user interface of typical Ubuntu desktop, the phone can run several applications on external display such as Firefox web browser, SNS clients and 'mobile view' application enabling total access to the Bionic and its screen. In September 2011, Motorola released the source code of Webtop application at SourceForge.
