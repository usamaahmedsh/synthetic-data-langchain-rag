== History ==


=== "Project 7401" ===
The history of the metro network in Zhengzhou dates back to 1974, when the first metro project in Zhengzhou was planned. It was called as the "Project 7401", since it was the first project approved by the CPC Henan Provincial Committee in 1974. The project was designed for both civilian and military use, as a single track metro line in peacetime, and could be used for civil defense during war. The first phase was planned to start at Huayuan Road (near Zijingshan), then move westward via Erqi Square, and ends at the Cable Factory on Funiu Road, with 6 stations. Part of the planned route was similar to the route of the current Line 1. Construction began in 1975, and stopped in 1980, when the project was finally called off. Some sections of the tunnels and one station in Bishagang (not the current Bishagang station) had been completed then. The completed station was transformed into an underground department store in 1982.


=== The First Round of Construction ===
In 2000, the planning of the current Zhengzhou Metro system was started. The plan had been adjusted several times, and was finalized in 2008. The first phase of the system, including Line 1 and Line 2, was approved by National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in February 2009.  Construction of Line 1 started on 6 June 2009 and Line 2 started construction on 28 December 2010.  As planned, Line 1 and Line 2 commenced operations on 26 December 2013 and 19 August 2016 respectively. On January 12, 2017, Chengjiao line started operation. It is in through services with Line 2 and allows the system to serve the Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport.


=== The Second Round of Construction ===
In April 2014, the NDRC published the Construction Plan of Zhengzhou Rapid Transit System (2014-2020), marking the start of the second round of construction. The plan includes the Line 1 Phase II, Line 2 Phase II, Line 3 Phase I, Line 4, and Line 5, with a total length of 120.7 kilometres (75.0 mi). The second phase of Line 1 was put into use on 12 January 2017, Line 5 opened on 20 May 2019. Line 2 Phase II opened on 28 December 2019. Line 3 and Line 4 opened on 26 December 2020.


=== The Third Round of Construction ===
In April 2019, the NDRC approved the Phase III Construction Plan of Zhengzhou Rapid Transit System (2019-2024), marking the start of the third round of construction. The plan includes the Line 3 Phase II, and the first phase of Line 6, Line 7, Line 8, Line 10, Line 12 and Line 14 with a total length of 159.6 kilometres (99.2 mi). Line 10 and Line 14 are already under construction. Line 14 was opened on 19 September 2019.


== Accidents and incidents ==
On 22 February 2013, four workers were buried at the construction site of Tongbailu station (current Wuyigongyuan station) due to collapse. Two of them were killed and the other two injured.
On 31 July 2018, 12 workers at the construction site of Zhengzhou People's Hospital station on Line 5 were sent to hospital for feeling headache and nausea caused by lack of oxygen.


=== July 2021 floods ===

Beginning on July 17, 2021, heavy rains occurred in Henan. The rainfall in Zhengzhou from 20:20 on July 17 to 20:20 on July 20 reached 617.1 mm (24.30 in), of which the rainfall within an hour from 16:00 to 17:00 on July 20 reached 201.9 mm (7.95 in). It broke through historical records, far exceeding the "24-hour rainfall exceeding 200 mm (7.87 in)" extreme rainstorm level designated by the National Meteorological Center.
On July 20, many stations were flooded with heavy water, which caused serious water accumulation. A landslide accident occurred at a construction site of Longzihu Xi of Line 12 in the morning, but no casualties were caused.
At about 18:00 on July 20, rainwater entered the tunnel between Haitansi station and Shakoulu station of Line 5. A train was trapped in the tunnel and water flooded. The water level in the car once reached the chest position, and passengers stranded in the car were trapped for several hours, until they were rescued and left the carriage. The floods in Zhengzhou Metro killed 14 people.
Zhengzhou Metro closed several stations, and then announced the suspension of operation of the whole system at 18:00 on July 20.
Line 1, Line 2 (Liuzhuang to Nansihuan section) and Chengjiao line reopened on September 12. Line 2 (Jiahe to Liuzhuang section), Line 3, Line 4 and Line 5 reopened on September 15. Due to equipment replacement, Line 14 reopened later on 29 August 2022.
Some of trains were damaged in the floods while they were in service or stabling in the depots. After the floods, most of them were taken out of service, received electrical reconstructions and tested before they returned to service.

== Fares and tickets ==
Fares of Zhengzhou Metro are calculated by distance traveled, ranging from ¥2 (within 6 km (3.7 mi)) to ¥9 (the longest journeys within the current system). A journey shorter than 6 km (3.7 mi) costs ¥2; ¥1 is charged for every 7 km (4.3 mi) after 6 km (3.7 mi), every 8 km (5.0 mi) after 13 km (8.1 mi), and every 9 km (5.6 mi) after 21 km (13 mi).

There are also student fares, which are half the adult fare, for full-time students enrolled in primary or middle schools.
