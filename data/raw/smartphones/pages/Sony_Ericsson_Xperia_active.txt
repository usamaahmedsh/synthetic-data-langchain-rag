The Sony Ericsson Xperia active is a smartphone produced by Sony Ericsson. Released in October 2011, it was the last smartphone released under the Sony Ericsson brand before Sony bought out Ericsson's stake in the joint-venture. It runs the Android operating system. It contains similar hardware as other 2011 Xperia phones in a smaller package. The phone is marketed towards people with an 'active lifestyle', hence the name, and comes with a scratch resistant screen, dust and water resistant casing and pre-loaded fitness applications. It is small in size with a 3" touchscreen with wet finger tracking, similar to that of the Xperia Mini.
It has a two-layer removable rear cover.
