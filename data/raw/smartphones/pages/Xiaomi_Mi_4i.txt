The Xiaomi Mi4i (Chinese: 小米手机4i) is a smartphone developed by Xiaomi Inc. It is part of Xiaomi's mid-range smartphone line, and was released in April 2015. Xiaomi held a media event in Siri Fort Auditorium, Delhi to formally introduce the mid-range phone, and also supplied its fans with their complementary smart-accessory, the Xiaomi MiBand, during the Xiaomi New Product Launch Event 2015 on April 23, 2015.
The Mi4i is a slightly bumped down version of its predecessor, the Xiaomi Mi4. The phone has a different design than its predecessor and has a polycarbonate body. It was also released with the new MIUI 6 (introduced in August 2014) based on Android Lollipop.
Reception towards the device was generally positive, though there were still a high amount of negative feedback from users of Apple's iPhone 5C due to its similar design and quality. Some media companies hailed it to be one of the best smartphones available in the market due to its high-end hardware which is sold for comparably lower price than its competitors.


== History ==
Before its official unveiling, media speculation primarily focused on leaks; including photos that announced the Mi4i. While the device was announced on April 23, it didn't become available until April 30, running MIUI 6 (Android Lollipop).
Xiaomi launched the Mi4i specifically in India first and plans to expand sales throughout Asia.
