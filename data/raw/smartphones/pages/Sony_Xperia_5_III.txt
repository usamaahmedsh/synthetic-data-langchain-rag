The Sony Xperia 5 III is an Android smartphone manufactured by Sony. Part of Sony's Xperia series, the phone was announced on  April 14, 2021, along with the larger Xperia 1 III and the mid-range Xperia 10 III.


== Design ==
The Xperia 5 III retains Sony's signature square design that is seen on previous Xperia phones. It is built similarly to the Xperia 1 III, using anodized aluminum for the frame and Corning Gorilla Glass 6 for the screen and back panel, as well as IP65 and IP68 certifications for water resistance. The build has a pair of symmetrical bezels on the top and the bottom, where the front-facing dual stereo speakers are placed. The left side of the phone contains a slot for a SIM card and a microSDXC card, while the right side contains a fingerprint reader embedded into the power button, a volume rocker and a shutter button. A dedicated Google Assistant button is located between the power and shutter buttons. The earpiece, front-facing camera, notification LED and various sensors are housed in the top bezel. The bottom edge has the primary microphone and USB-C port; the rear cameras are arranged in a vertical strip. The phone ships in three colors: Black, Green and Pink.
