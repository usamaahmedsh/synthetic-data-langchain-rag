The HTC ChaCha (also known as the HTC ChaChaCha in Spanish-speaking countries or the HTC Status in the US and Canada)  is an Android smartphone that was announced by HTC in February 2011 at the Mobile World Congress, alongside its sister phone, the HTC Salsa.
The ChaCha is primarily designed for text messaging, and also features tight integration with the social network Facebook, which includes a dedicated Facebook button below its keyboard which allows users to quickly share content on the service.
