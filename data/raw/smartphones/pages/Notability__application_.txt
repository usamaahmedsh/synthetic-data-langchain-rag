Notability is a note-taking and PDF annotation application developed by Ginger Labs for iOS, iPadOS and macOS. The application allows users to combine handwritten and typed notes with sketches, images, and audio recordings in a single document. The app is widely used by students, educators, and professionals for digital note-taking, annotation, and organizations across Apple devices.


== History ==
Notability was first released in 2010 by Ginger Labs, a California-based software company that develops productivity tools for Apple platforms.
The app gained early popularity among iPad users for its intuitive handwriting and recording features, which allowed users to take written notes while simultaneously capturing synchronized audio.
In 2014, a desktop version of Notability was released for macOS, expanding its ecosystem and enabling cross-device syncing through iCloud.
In November 2021, Ginger Labs announced that Notability would transition from a one-time purchase to a freemium model, making the app free to download with a premium subscription tier for advanced features. This change aligned Notability with other productivity apps such as Evernote and GoodNotes.
In August 2023, the company introduced a redesign interface with updated navigation, streamlined note organization, and accessibility improvements. The redesign aimed to modernize the user experience and improve efficiency for users managing large sets of notes across devices.


== Features ==
Like other note-taking software, Notability supports typing and drawing on a virtual notepad. The app supports directly editing and exporting to the PDF file format, and supports many other document file formats. Files are synced to iCloud and users can share files with other users via a link-based system.
The app also supports multiple other features including simultaneous audio recording and the conversion of handwriting and math equations to text. Notability supports the usage of a stylus on desktop platforms and the Apple Pencil on the iPad.
In 2021, Notability transitioned into a freemium model, making the app free to download with optional premium features such as handwriting-to-text conversion, unlimited editing tools, and advanced PDF annotation capabilities. The update also introduced cloud-based syncing and storage improvements through iCloud and third-party services.
A major redesign in 2023 introduced an updated interface, customizable toolbars, and improved accessibility options aimed at simplifying note organization and multitasking. Recent updates have added AI-powered handwriting recognition, advanced search filters, and new digital pen textures for sketching and highlighting.


== Reception ==
Notability has been well-reviewed for its intuitive design, smooth handwriting experience, and usefulness in educational and professional settings. Comparative reviews such as Paperlike's "App Review: GoodNotes vs. Notability" have been highlighted Notability's ease of use and quick note organization, while Being Paperless commended its fluid writing experience and regular updates that keep it competitive among digital note-taking apps.
