=== Hardware ===
The ROG Phone 3's overall design is similar to its predecessor (the ROG Phone 2) - aluminum chassis and a glass backplate. It retains the RGB-illuminated logo on the back of the device which can be user-customized to show different colors. Two LED modules are located next to the camera, one of which acts as a flash and the other is an RGB LED used to light up the optional Lighting Armour case. The front of the phone features front-facing stereo speakers on either side of the display, and a camera built into the top bezel. The screen has a refresh rate of 144 Hz compared to the 120 Hz refresh rate of the ROG Phone 2, which can be configured to 60/90/120/144 Hz or Auto in the phone settings. The display itself is a 6.59-inch 1080p AMOLED panel with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, which is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 6 and supports DCI-P3 and HDR10+ with 270 Hz touch sensing. The device uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865/865+ SoC and Adreno 650 GPU, paired with 8, 12 or 16 GB of RAM and 128 GB, 256 GB, or 512 GB of non-expandable UFS 3.1 storage. Power is provided by a 6000 mAh battery, and 30 W fast charging is supported along with 10 W reverse charging. Signature features such as the 'vapor-chamber' cooling technology and custom double USB-C port on the side of the phone have also been carried over. The ultrasonic 'air triggers' now have motion-sensing abilities, and both can be split into two sub-triggers or used as slide gestures. Gaming accessories are also available including the AeroActive Cooler 3, the ROG Kunai Gamepad and Twinview Dock 3.

=== Software ===
The ROG Phone 3 uses ROG UI, a modified Asus skin based on Android 11, but can be configured to use the standard ZenUI 6 found on the ZenFone 6, which functions very similarly to stock Android. The phone has several preloaded gaming-focused apps such as ASUS Armoury Crate which gives users advanced control over the hardware and software by allowing per-game performance profiles to be set up, as well as enabling detailed configuration of the RGB LEDs on the phone and its accessories. The phone also comes with Game Genie, which allows live configuration of phone settings in game and provides a moveable UI element displaying FPS, temperature and clock speeds. It also enables configuration of AirTriggers, game specific macros, silencing notifications and a record or live stream function.
