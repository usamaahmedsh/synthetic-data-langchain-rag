== Reception ==
While the device itself had been praised for its specifications and build quality, critics have criticized the Ubuntu Touch operating system.
GSMArena stated that "overall, all the bits and pieces that made the Meizu Pro 5 great are still present, but even on paper, we can already see quite a lot of compromises brought about by the new OS in the Ubuntu Edition at hand".
Softpedia gave the device a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, concluding that they "would recommend [the] Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition to those who like smartphones with big screens, Ubuntu Phone fans [..], as well as very curious people who get bored easily and always enjoy trying something new".
