=== Hardware ===
The BlackBerry Motion shares many of its specifications with the more upmarket BlackBerry KeyOne, albeit lacking the physical keyboard. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, backed by 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB flash memory. It has a 12 MP rear camera with a f/2.0 aperture, capable of recording 4K video. The front camera is an 8 MP sensor capable of recording 1080p video.
Like many midrange phones of its era, the Motion sports a 5.5-inch display with a Full HD (1080p) resolution. It has a 4,000 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 support. Additional features include IP67 water and dust resistance, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB-C charging and data transfer port, and a front-mounted fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader also doubles as a capacitive trackpad, in a similar fashion to the keyboard in the KeyOne and the Priv.


=== Software ===
BlackBerry Motion originally shipped with Android 7.1 Nougat.
However, during August 2018, Blackberry started to roll out Android 8.1 Oreo updates.
