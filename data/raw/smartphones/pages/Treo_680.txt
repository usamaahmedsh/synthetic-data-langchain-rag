The Palm Treo 680 is a combination hybrid PDA/cellphone, or smartphone as the successor to the company's Treo 650.
It was the first-ever Palm OS Treo with no external antenna.
The Treo 680 is older, larger, and heavier than the Palm Centro. But the Treo 680 has a larger keyboard which is more comfortable to type on. There are other differences between the Treo 680 and the Centro. An article on the Treonauts weblog includes a good comparison chart and some in-depth commentary.

== Carriers ==
AT&T and Rogers were the only carriers to offer the Treo 680 in North America; but, for a more expensive price, you could get an unlocked GSM Treo that worked with any GSM/GPRS/EDGE network worldwide.
The Treo 680 was also available from many carriers worldwide including Singtel, Vodafone in NZ & Aus, Globe, Orange France, Swisscom, Telcel MX, Cable & Wireless (Caribbean) and Claro in Brazil.


== Colors ==
The Treo 680 came in several colours: Arctic, Copper, Crimson, and Graphite. Initially, Graphite was the only colour available to wireless carriers, with the Arctic, Copper and Crimson models available unlocked exclusively through Palm.com and Palm's retail stores. This policy was reversed in the US, with Graphite the only color available unlocked and AT&T along with Rogers selling the colored models. In other countries, unlocked color models were available.
