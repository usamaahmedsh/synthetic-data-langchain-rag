The Droid Turbo was a high-end smartphone developed by Motorola Mobility. It is part of the Verizon Droid line, and was announced on October 28, 2014, on the Verizon Droid Does website. The Droid Turbo maintains a similar design shape to its predecessor, the Droid Maxx, with new durable ballistic nylon or metallized glass fiber reinforced with Kevlar as the materials offered. The on-screen buttons for back, home, and multitask functions were kept off-screen as capacitive soft-keys below the display. Due to Lenovo closing its acquisition of Motorola Mobility from Google, the Droid Turbo was the first phone released by Motorola Mobility under Lenovo ownership, as it was released through Verizon Wireless first on the same day the Lenovo sale closed, October 30, 2014.
