KDE Telepathy (sometimes abbreviated as KTp) was an instant messaging (IM) client which supported text-, voice- and video-based communication as well as file transfers over various IM protocols. It used the Freedesktop.org Telepathy framework as its back-end and was the replacement for Kopete, focused on improving the integration between different components of the KDE Software Compilation that may benefit from real-time communication and collaboration features. The project was designated "Unmaintained" in 2016 and the related source code repositories were made read-only in 2023.
