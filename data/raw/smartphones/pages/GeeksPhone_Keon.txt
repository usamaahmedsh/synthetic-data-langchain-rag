The GeeksPhone Keon was an entry-level smartphone released by GeeksPhone in April 2013. It was intended for software developers wanting to build and test mobile applications on the then new Firefox OS, not for general consumers.
The Keon and the higher-end Peak were the first commercially available mobile devices running Firefox OS.
