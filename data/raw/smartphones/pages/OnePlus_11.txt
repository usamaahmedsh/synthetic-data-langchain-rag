The OnePlus 11 is an Android-based smartphone manufactured by OnePlus and co-developed with Hasselblad. It was released on January 9th, 2023 and succeeds the OnePlus 10 Pro. It ships with a screen protector pre-applied.
It diverted from usual portfolio offering, in which there is only one flagship offered. This is an effort by OnePlus to streamline its flagship and marked the end of 'Pro' naming scheme onwards. There is a lesser variant called OnePlus 11R which is only available in India.

The OnePlus 11 brings a sleek and modern design that reflects the brand's focus on aesthetics and build quality. It is composed of glass and metal combination. Both front and back are covered in Gorilla Glass Victus and 5 respectively. It is supported by aluminium frame.
At launch, two colors were available, with color addition later on:

Titan Black - has a matte-frosted glass with silky finish. Fingerprint-resistant design.
Eternal Green - has a glossy finish, inspired by the shade of rainforest dusk. Features an internal layering treatment that reduces fingerprint smudges. Only available for 256GB model and above.
OnePlus also brings another new edition, called OnePlus 11 Jupiter Rock Limited Edition, also powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It is only available in China.
Its distinguishing appearance is on the design of its back camera. It features a circular camera housing on the back, which contains a triple-camera setup and the flash. Hasselblad branding is visible in the middle. The circular design is distinctive enough to make it one of the standout design elements of the OnePlus 11.
It has a curved front screen and back design. The placement of front camera is positioned in the upper left corner of the front screen. Volume rocker is situated on the left side of the body and there is a unique feature called the "alert slider", which makes a return after being removed by OnePlus for previous series on the right. The power button is positioned at the lower right side of the body.
The SIM card tray, microphone, USB-C connector and speaker are on the bottom. The top hosts another speaker and microphone.
