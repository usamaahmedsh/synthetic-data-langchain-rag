The Samsung Galaxy S25 is a series of high-end Android-based smartphones developed and marketed by Samsung Electronics as part of its flagship Galaxy S series. They collectively serve as the successor to the Galaxy S24 series. The S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra models were announced on January 22, 2025, at the Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose, California, and were released on February 7, 2025.
Two additional models were also launched in the series: the Galaxy S25 Edge, was launched at Galaxy Unpacked on May 13, 2025, and was later released on May 30; and Galaxy S25 FE was launched on September 4, 2025 and was released to the market two weeks later on September 20, 2025.


== Lineup ==
The Galaxy S25 lineup includes five models: Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 FE and the Galaxy S25 Edge, which is the thinnest Samsung phone since the Galaxy A8 (2015) and U100 (2007).
The Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2 in (160 mm) display. The Galaxy S25+ offers similar internal hardware with a larger 6.7 in (170 mm) display. The Galaxy S25 Ultra includes a 6.9 in (180 mm) display, a larger frame compared to its predecessor, and rounded corners that align more closely with the design language of the Galaxy S series.
The Galaxy S25 Edge, a new addition to the series, also has a 6.7-inch (17 cm) display and is the thinnest and most compact model in the lineup, at 5.8 mm (0.23 in) thick. Across the line-up, weights range from 162 g (Galaxy S25) to 218 g (Galaxy S25 Ultra).
While the S25 and S25+ have dimensions similar to their S24 counterparts, the S25 Ultra includes design adjustments, and the S25 Edge is distinguished by a thinner chassis.

The Galaxy S25 series (except the FE model) is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Unlike previous Galaxy S generations that used different chipsets by region, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is used uniformly across all global variants. Manufactured using a 3 nm process, the chipset features an octa-core CPU with two high-performance Oryon cores clocked up to 4.47 GHz and six efficiency cores running at 3.53 GHz. Its Adreno 830 GPU provides hardware-accelerated graphics and AI-related processing, enabling performance in resource-intensive applications.
All models in the lineup feature a redesigned vapor chamber cooling system that helps dissipate heat produced by the chipset during heavy workloads. While select models share the same processor, the size and design of the vapor chamber differ by device. The S25 and S25+ use chambers approximately 15% larger than those of the Galaxy S24 series, the S25 FE has a 10% larger vapor chamber for cooling, the S25 Edge adopts a vapor chamber with a thinner and wider surface area, and the S25 Ultra integrates a chamber about 40% larger with additional material layers for heat dissipation.
The Galaxy S25, S25+, S25 Ultra and S25 Edge all offer the same eSIM functionality within each respective region. International variants support dual Nano-SIM slots along with dual eSIM profiles. U.S. models include a single Nano-SIM slot with dual eSIM support, while Chinese versions retain the traditional dual Nano-SIM configuration without eSIM capability.
In addition to manufacturing the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Vietnam and India, it was also officially manufactured in Egypt and launched in the local market through official stores and agents, as well as exported to the Gulf and North African countries as a first step towards exporting this product.


== Design ==

The S25 and S25+ smartphones have an aluminum body and a glass back, similar to the design of their predecessors. Both the S25 and S25+ use Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for both the front display and rear glass panel.
They come in five standard colors: Icy Blue, Mint, Navy, Silver Shadow, and Blue Black, having been previously available exclusively through Samsung's online website alongside Pink Gold and Coral Red before pulling it off its exclusive list due to higher demand than anticipated.
The S25 Ultra has a titanium body and a glass back, similar to the S24 Ultra; however, the phone features rounded corners, unlike the S24 Ultra's squared corners. Additionally, the S25 Ultra uses Gorilla Glass Armor 2 for its front display and rear panel for improved durability and reduced glare.
The S25 Ultra comes in four standard colors: Titanium Silver Blue, Titanium Black, Titanium White Silver and Titanium Grey, with the Titanium Jet Black, initially an exclusive option, being added to the roaster later on due to high demand. The S25 Ultra comes in two additional colors that are only available through Samsung's online website: Titanium Jade Green and Titanium Pink Gold.

The S25 Edge is available in three colors: Titanium Icy Blue, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Jet Black. 


== Specifications ==


=== Display ===
The Galaxy S25 series features a Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X display across all models with HDR10+ support and a 120 Hz refresh rate, reaching up to 2600 nits. Each device also includes an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint sensor. The S25 Ultra uses Corning Gorilla Armor 2, the S25 Edge uses Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front, and the S25 and S25+ use Gorilla Glass Victus 2.
According to Corning, the Gorilla Armor 2 on the S25 Ultra offers enhanced durability, with over four times greater scratch resistance than conventional lithium-aluminosilicate cover glass and features anti-reflective properties to reduce surface glare. Laboratory tests further reported that it can withstand drops of up to 2.2 metres onto a surface simulating concrete, while comparable glass-ceramic materials reportedly failed from 1 metre.


==== ProScaler ====
ProScaler is an AI-based upscaling technology imbedded in the Galaxy S25+, S25 Edge, and S25 Ultra models. Leveraging Samsung's ProVisual Engine, ProScaler is designed to enhance lower-resolution content by upscaling them to higher resolutions, improving how such content appears on high-resolution displays. The ProScaler feature, is optimized for QHD+ resolution (3120×1440 pixels), which provides higher pixel density compared to FHD+. QHD+ allows ProScaler’s AI-based upscaling to produce consistent visuals.


=== Camera ===

The Galaxy S25 and S25+ each feature a triple rear camera system consisting of a 50 MP wide-angle (main) camera, a 12 MP ultra-wide camera with a 120° field of view, and a 10 MP telephoto camera offering 3× optical zoom. The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a quad camera setup, including a 200 MP wide-angle camera, a 50 MP ultra-wide camera, a 10 MP telephoto camera with 3× optical zoom, and a 50 MP periscope telephoto camera with 5× optical zoom. The Galaxy S25 Edge includes a dual-camera system with a 200 MP wide-angle sensor and a 12 MP ultrawide sensor, without a telephoto lens. All models in the series are equipped with a 12 MP front-facing camera (f/2.2) for selfies and video calls.
Under the ProVisual Engine—a Samsung Galaxy AI imaging system—the Ultra model includes image processing features such as adaptive scene optimization and noise reduction for photography and videography. The S25 Ultra further introduces a Quad Tele System, allowing four distinct optical zoom levels (2×, 3×, 5×, and 10×), which provides flexibility in framing subjects at varying distances. All models support pixel-binning techniques and include a Super Steady video mode for stabilization.
All models in the series are capable of recording video in up to 8K resolution at 30 fps, delivering high-resolution video capture across the lineup.


=== Batteries ===
The Galaxy S25 models have similar battery capacities to the S24 series, except for the S25 Edge, which has a smaller battery than the S25+ due to its decreased thickness despite having nearly identical height and width. The S25 and S25 Edge support wired charging at up to 25 W, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra support 45 W charging. The S25 Ultra can reach up to 65% charge in around 30 minutes with a 45 W adapter, while the S25 and S25 Edge reach about 50% in the same time with a 25 W adapter.
All four support Qi2 inductive charging up to 15 W, and can charge other Qi-compatible devices wirelessly using battery power.


=== Memory and storage ===
Unlike previous generations, all Galaxy S25 models launched with 12 GB of RAM. The S25 starts at 128 GB of storage, while the other three models start at 256 GB of storage. The S25 Edge also comes standard with 12 GB of RAM and does not offer configurable RAM options.
However, in South Korea and Greater China (Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) markets, a 16 GB RAM option exists for certain Galaxy S25 Ultra models. For South Korean models, Titanium Jetblack phones with 1 TB of storage come with 16 GB of RAM. For Greater China, regardless of color choice, the 1 TB storage option comes with 16 GB of RAM.


=== Connectivity ===
All models except for the S25 FE in the Galaxy S25 series support 5G connectivity, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and USB Type-C 3.2 for data transfer and charging. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is supported only on the S25+, S25 Edge, and S25 Ultra models. The S25 FE only supports Wi-Fi 6E


== Software ==

The Galaxy S25 phones were launched with Android 15 and One UI 7, except for the S25 FE, which launched with Android 16 and One UI 8.0. They are eligible to receive 7 years of OS and security updates (with support ending in 2032).
The devices are additionally shipped with Galaxy AI, Samsung's suite of artificial intelligence features. As a relatively new technology, it has received updated capabilities in the S25 series.


== Reception ==
Whilst iterative, the S25 was reviewed as a well-balanced phone, and one of the best of 2025, with only its AI receiving (as a new technology) some caveats. It was also praised as being the most compact of Android's high-end phones and for its ease of repair and usage of recycled materials.


=== S Pen controversy ===
With the release of the S25 Ultra, Samsung opted to remove the Bluetooth functionality in its trademark S Pen, a feature added to the stylus with the Galaxy Note 9 in 2018. Samsung sought to remove the Bluetooth features between phone and pen as a cost-saving measure, claiming it was used by less than 1% of Galaxy users.
Among the functions lost in are remote camera control, air actions, and several in-app features for programs such as PowerPoint or the native Gallery app.
