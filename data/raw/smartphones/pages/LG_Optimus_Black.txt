The LG P970 Optimus Black is a smartphone designed and manufactured by LG Electronics and was released in 2011. At 9.2 mm in thickness, it was LG's thinnest smartphone at the time of its release, and is slightly thinner than the iPhone 4. The LG Optimus Black features a WVGA NOVA display which has a brightness measured at 749 nits, which surpasses the 700 nits promised by LG. LG Optimus Black is claimed to be the first smartphone with a 2MP front camera.

In the United States, the LG Optimus Black is offered by various wireless carriers using their individual brandings.

== Software updates ==
The LG P970 Optimus Black and CDMA variants received an upgrade to Android 2.3.4, resulting in improved battery life, enhanced autofocus, and new apps. As of 4 January 2013, an upgrade to Android 4.0.4 was made available for the P970 through the official LGMobile Support Tool; however, no such upgrade was made available for the CDMA variants of the phone, and attempting to upgrade it using the P970's firmware would render the device inoperable.
