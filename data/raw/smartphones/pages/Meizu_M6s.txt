=== Software ===
The smartphone was released on Flyme 6.2 (China version) or Flyme 6.3.1.0G (Global version), which was based on Android 7.0 Nougat. It was updated to Flyme 8.0.5.0A/Flyme 8.19.12.17A beta (China version) or Flyme 7.1.6.0G (Global version) which both still based on Android 7.0 Nougat.


==== Control ====
In order to reduce the bezels around the display and to follow up the trending 18:9 display type which was in 2017-2018, Meizu had to remove the mechanical mBack button. There are three ways to navigate the device: the on-screen Super mBack button in the form of a ring and the standard 3 Android navigation buttons, or the swiping gesture later added in future Flyme versions (similar to the iPhone X).
The area where the Super mBack ring is located was made pressure-sensitive (something similar to 3D Touch technology). It is controlled similarly to the mechanical mBack.


== Reception ==
A reviewer from the information portal ITC.ua gave the Meizu M6s a score of 4 out of 5.  He attributed the lack of NFC and Type-C, display color rendering and nuances of Flyme OS to the disadvantages. The reviewer attributed the design, screen with a 2 to 1 aspect ratio, original control scheme, fast fingerprint scanner, updated platform, decent cameras and fast charging to the advantages.
A reviewer from Pingvin.Pro gave the smartphone a score of 5.7 out of 10.  He attributed the metal body, appearance, processor, dimensions, screen, cameras and battery life to the advantages of the smartphone.  He attributed the power button, fingerprint scanner placement, microUSB, firmware, memory speed and graphics to the disadvantages.
