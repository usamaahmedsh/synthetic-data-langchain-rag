GetThere is a corporate travel reservation system that is owned by Serko.


== History ==
GetThere first started in 1995 as a company named Internet Travel Network (itn.net) founded by Dan Whaley, Al Whaley and Bruce Yoxsimer. It changed its name to GetThere and went public on NASDAQ under the ticker GTHR in 1999 and was acquired by Sabre in August 2000 for $757 million.
Following the acquisition, the firm merged with the Sabre Business Travel Solutions system and became part of the Sabre Travel Network. The first airline reservation (SFO-LAS) ever made over the World Wide Web was made on June 5, 1995 through an ITN server in Palo Alto, CA.
In January 2025, it was announced that Serko had completed the purchase of GetThere for $12 million. However, it was reported that Sabre Corporation had become a partner in its former subsidiary.
