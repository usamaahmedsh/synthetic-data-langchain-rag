The Huawei Ascend G600 is an Android smartphone made by Huawei. It was released in 2012 during August.


== Models ==
The phone comes in the following 4 different models, all supported by the Google Play Store:

HUAWEI U8950N-1
HUAWEI U8950N-51
HUAWEI U8950-1
HUAWEI U8950D
The first letter of each model is the network: U = UMTS (WCDMA) and C = CDMA. The last D stands for Dual Sim feature.
Note that the U8950 G600 sold outside China, is single sim. C8950D is the CDMA dual sim version.
The HUAWEI U8950N-1 & HUAWEI U8950N-51 appear to be American / Australian models, while the HUAWEI U8950D is the Chinese model.


== Specifications ==
Though the phone would be classed as 'mid-range', its hardware and features allow it to fall into the upper range of mid-range phones. So essentially, it just borderlines high range.
