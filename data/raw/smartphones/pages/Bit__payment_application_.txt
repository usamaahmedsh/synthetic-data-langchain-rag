bit is an Israeli digital payment application developed by Bank Hapoalim. The app allows users to transfer money instantly using their mobile devices and has become one of the most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platforms in Israel.


== History ==
bit was launched in 2017 by Bank Hapoalim as a response to the growing demand for digital and mobile payment solutions in Israel. Initially, the app was designed primarily for peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers, enabling users to send and receive payments without the need for cash or traditional bank transfers. Over time, bit expanded its capabilities to include payments to businesses, integration with E-commerce platforms, and additional financial services.
The app quickly gained popularity due to its user-friendly interface, seamless transactions, and accessibility, even for individuals who do not hold a Bank Hapoalim account. Competing with similar apps such as PayBox (by Israel Discount Bank) and Pepper Pay (by Bank Leumi), bit emerged as a dominant force in the Israeli digital payments market.
In 2021, Bank Hapoalim announced significant enhancements to bit, including partnerships with major retailers and financial service providers. The app continued to evolve, offering new features to meet the growing demand for cashless transactions in Israel.


== Features ==
bit provides a variety of digital payment solutions, including:

Instant P2P money transfers – Users can send and receive money quickly using only a phone number, without requiring the recipient's bank account details.
Business payments – Merchants and small businesses can receive payments via bit, reducing reliance on traditional credit card transactions.
E-commerce integration – bit enables online purchases through partnerships with Israeli retailers and e-commerce platforms.
Bill splitting – Users can split payments with friends and family, simplifying shared expenses such as restaurant bills or group purchases.
Subscription payments – The app allows for recurring payments, useful for services such as club memberships or monthly fees.
Multi-bank support – While bit was initially exclusive to Bank Hapoalim customers, it later expanded to support users from all Israeli banks.


== Market impact ==
bit has significantly contributed to the digitization of payments in Israel, leading to a decline in cash-based transactions, particularly among younger consumers. The app's widespread adoption has influenced businesses and individuals to transition toward a more cashless economy.
As of 2023, bit holds a substantial market share in Israel's mobile payments sector, with millions of users relying on the platform for daily transactions. Its success has prompted regulatory discussions about competition in Israel's financial sector, as traditional banks continue to dominate the digital payments space.


== Security and regulation ==
bit operates under the regulatory framework of the Bank of Israel, ensuring compliance with financial security and data protection standards. The app uses advanced encryption and fraud detection mechanisms to secure transactions and protect user information.
To combat fraud and unauthorized transactions, bit imposes transfer limits and identity verification measures, particularly for larger transactions. The app also provides users with customer support for dispute resolution and transaction tracking.


== Competition ==
bit faces competition from other Israeli digital payment apps, including:

PayBox – Developed by Israel Discount Bank, offering group payment features.
Pepper Pay – A digital payment solution from Bank Leumi.
Google Pay and Apple Pay – International mobile payment services that entered the Israeli market, providing an alternative for credit card transactions.
Despite these competitors, bit remains a leading choice for digital payments in Israel due to its simplicity, brand recognition, and strong banking infrastructure.
