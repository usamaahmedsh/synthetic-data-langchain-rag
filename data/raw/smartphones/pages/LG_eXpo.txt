LG eXpo (GW820) also known as LG GW820 is a projector-enabled mobile phone designed for business users, and manufactured by LG Electronics. It runs Microsoft's Windows Mobile operating system, and was released in December 2009.
The phone features a 3.2 inch resistive screen, which is operated by holding a stylus pen. It boasts a crisp screen with pixel density of 291.5 ppi (diagonal) which is very close to with iPhone 4's retina display at 329.6 ppi (diagonal). It has a fingerprint sensor which acts as D-pad and omits the need to input password as well as instil extra security for business users.  The stylus is stored externally, in a cylindrical container with a cap. It is the first mobile phone to feature a handheld projector.
