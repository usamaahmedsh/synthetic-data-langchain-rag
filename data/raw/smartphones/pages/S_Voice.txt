S Voice is a discontinued intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator which is only available as a built-in application for the Galaxy S III, S III Mini, S4, S4 Mini, S4 Active, S5, S5 Mini, S II Plus, Note II, Note 3, Note 4, Note 10.1, Note 8.0, Stellar, Mega, Grand, Avant, Core, Ace 3, Tab 3 7.0, Tab 3 8.0, Express 2, Tab 3 10.1, Galaxy Camera, and other 2013 or later Samsung Android devices. The application uses a natural language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Web services. S Voice is based on the Vlingo personal assistant. For Galaxy S5 and later Galaxy devices, S Voice runs on Nuance instead of Vlingo.
Some of the capabilities of S Voice include making appointments, opening apps, setting alarms, updating social network websites such as Facebook or Twitter and navigation. S Voice also offers multitasking, as well as automatic activation features, for example, when the car engine is started.
In a disclaimer that pops up on first opening S Voice, Samsung states that the app is provided by a third party, which it does not name.
In the Galaxy S8 and S8+, Bixby was announced to be a major update and replacement to S Voice from the prior phones. It was discontinued on 1 June 2020.
