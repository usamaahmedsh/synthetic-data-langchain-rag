Voice over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (VoATM) is a data protocol used to transport packetized voice signals over an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network.  In ATM, the voice traffic is encapsulated using AAL1/AAL2 ATM packets. VoATM over DSL is a similar service, which is used to carry packetized voice signals over a DSL connection.


== Protocols ==
ATM Adaptation Layer 1 (AAL1)
ATM Adaptation Layer 2 (AAL2)


== Deployment ==
VoATM is a multi-service, high speed, scalable technology but rarely found because of its expensive services.


== Prioritization ==
Prioritization is implemented through QoS parameters.


== Fragmentation ==
Fragmentation is built into ATM with its small, fixed-sized, 53-byte cells.


== Variable delay ==
Dynamic Bandwidth Circuit Emulation Service (DBCES) does not send a constant bit stream of cells but transmit only at an active voice call, reducing delays and variations.


== Echo cancellation ==
VoATM transports data, voice, and video at very high speed. The same method for echo cancellation is employed.
