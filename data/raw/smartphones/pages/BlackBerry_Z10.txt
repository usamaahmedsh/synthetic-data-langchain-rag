The BlackBerry Z10 is a touchscreen-based smartphone developed by BlackBerry, previously known as RIM.
The BlackBerry Z10 was the first of two new BlackBerry phones presented at the BlackBerry 10 event on January 30, 2013.  The BlackBerry Z10 was followed by the Z30.


== Development ==
BlackBerry's chief operating officer Kristian Tear and chief marketing officer Frank Boulben fought against co-founder and former co-CEO Mike Lazaridis to have the touchscreen Z10 prioritized over the Q10 which had a physical keyboard.
Boublen was then responsible for and received "criticism for the marketing campaign that supported the Z10 launch, including a confusing Super Bowl advertisement which some board members hated".
Both Tear and Boublen were ousted on November 25, 2013 by new CEO John S. Chen, whom weeks earlier had replaced Thorsten Heins.


== Software ==

The BlackBerry Z10 used the BlackBerry 10 (at the time running on 10.3.3) mobile operating system based on QNX. The user interface of BB 10 was based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interaction with the OS included a range of multi-touch gestures, all of which had specific definitions within the context of the BB10 operating system and its multi-touch interface. The Z10 came pre-loaded with a variety of default BlackBerry applications.
The phone had a mobile hotspot functionality that could support up to 8 devices. It accessed the BlackBerry World, an online application distribution platform for the BlackBerry OS. The touchscreen keyboard featured predictive text capabilities.
The BlackBerry Z10 had an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera. Its camera software included a burst mode branded as "TimeShift".
The Z10 also featured voice control.


== Hardware ==
There were four SKUs for the Blackberry Z10, corresponding to the North American carrier band distribution and international versions. The LTE version of the Z10 featured the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus (SoC) which had a dual-core CPU running at 1.5 GHz, and an Adreno 225 GPU for LTE-capable units. For markets where LTE was not supported (international model), BlackBerry released the Z10 with the Texas Instruments OMAP 4470 (SoC) which had a dual-core CPU running at 1.5 GHz and a PowerVR SGX 544 GPU. It used a STE M5730 modem.
The outer housing of the Z10 frame was made of plastic combined with an internal stainless steel metal frame, while the back cover was made of plastic and protected by rubber finish. The on/off and volume button were made of metal.
It was available in black or white colour variants. A limited red edition was available for qualified app developers.
