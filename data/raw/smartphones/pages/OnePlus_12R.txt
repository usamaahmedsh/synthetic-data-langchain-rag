== Controversy ==
OnePlus had initially advertised that the 256 GB variant of phone comes with a flash storage of UFS 4.0 against the 128 GB variant which comes with UFS 3.1. However, some early buyers found the flash storage in 256 GB variant to be UFS 3.1 rather than claimed UFS 4.0. The company responded by apologising to buyers for miscommunication and called it an error on its part. It further offered a full refund to its initial buyers who wished to return the phone after this controversy came to light.


== Critical response ==
GSMArena rated the phone 4.1 out of 5, praising its battery life, camera and display. CNET gave it 8 out of 10 and called it an affordable alternative to OnePlus 12. The Mint praised the phone's performance designating it a flagship killer.
