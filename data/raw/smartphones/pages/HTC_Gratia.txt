The HTC Gratia is a smartphone manufactured by HTC Corporation that runs the Android operating system with HTC Sense.


== Release ==
The Gratia was released on October 18, 2010. It appears to be a European version of the HTC Aria.
Compared to HTC Aria, Gratia runs the more recent Android 2.2 rather than 2.1, which offers speed improvements running apps, and a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot feature for hopping online with the laptop wherever the phone has a 3G signal. However, the 600 MHz processor inside the HTC Gratia doesn't support Adobe Flash streaming video.
