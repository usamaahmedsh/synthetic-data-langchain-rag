The Xperia 5 IV is built similarly to the Xperia 1 IV, using anodized aluminum for the frame and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus for the screen and back panel, as well as IP65 and IP68 certifications for water resistance. The build has a pair of symmetrical bezels on the top and the bottom, where the front-facing dual stereo speakers are placed. The right side contains a fingerprint reader embedded into the power button, a volume rocker and a shutter button. The earpiece, front-facing camera, notification LED and various sensors are housed in the top bezel. The bottom edge has the primary microphone, USB-C port, and SIM/microSDXC card slot; the rear cameras are arranged in a vertical strip. The phone is available in three colors: Black, Green and White.
