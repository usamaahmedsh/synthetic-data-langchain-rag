The Sony Xperia 5 II is an Android smartphone marketed and manufactured by Sony Mobile. Part of Sony's flagship Xperia series, the phone was announced on September 17, 2020. A less expensive and more compact variant of the Xperia 1 II, the Xperia 5 II belongs to Sony's handset lineup of 2020, which includes the flagship Xperia 1 II and the entry-level Xperia 10 II. The phone was released worldwide in October 2020.
The Xperia 5 II ships with support for 5G NR in Europe and Asia (making it Sony's second Xperia device to support this network), while the United States will ship with a 4G variant. Although 5G networks are supported, it only supports "sub-6" 5G, meaning it is not compatible with millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks.


== Design ==
The Xperia 5 II retains Sony's signature square design that is seen on previous Xperia phones. It is built similarly to the Xperia 1 II, using anodized aluminum for the frame and Corning Gorilla Glass 6 for the screen and back panel, as well as IP65 and IP68 certifications for water resistance. The build has a pair of symmetrical bezels on the top and the bottom, where the front-facing dual stereo speakers and the front camera are placed. The left side of the phone contains a slot for a SIM card and a microSDXC card, while the right side contains a fingerprint reader embedded into the power button, a volume rocker and a shutter button. A dedicated Google Assistant button is located between the power and shutter buttons. The earpiece, front-facing camera, notification LED and various sensors are housed in the top bezel. The bottom edge has the primary microphone and USB-C port; the rear cameras are arranged in a vertical strip. The phone ships in four colours: Black, Gray, Blue and Pink.

=== Hardware ===
The Xperia 5 II is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC and an Adreno 650 GPU, accompanied by 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM. It has 128 or 256 GB of UFS internal storage, and microSD expansion is supported up to 1 TB with a hybrid dual-SIM setup. The display is smaller and has a lower resolution than the Xperia 1 II, using a 6.1 in 21:9 1080p (2520 × 1080) HDR OLED panel which results in a pixel density of 449 ppi. While the size and resolution are unchanged, it features a 120 Hz refresh rate. The camera system is similar to the Xperia 1 II in terms of hardware (a 12 MP primary lens, a 12 MP telephoto lens and a 12 MP ultrawide lens with an 8 MP front camera), but does not have a 3D iToF sensor. The telephoto lens has been upgraded from 2x to 3x optical zoom, and the ultrawide lens gains autofocus. Additionally, the lenses add ZEISS' T✻ (T-Star) anti-reflective coating. Software improvements include JPG+RAW shooting and HDR for 4K/120fps slow motion videos. The battery capacity has been increased to 4000mAh, the same as the 1 II despite the smaller body. USB Power Delivery 3.0 is supported at 21 W over USB-C, although it lacks wireless charging capabilities. The device includes a 3.5 mm audio jack, which was removed on its predecessor, as well as an active external amplifier.


=== Software ===
The Xperia 5 II runs on Android 10. Sony has also paired the phone's camera tech with a "Pro" mode developed by Sony's camera division CineAlta, whose features take after Sony's Alpha camera lineup.
