The ATIV Odyssey is a mid-range smartphone manufactured by Samsung. Like all products under the Ativ brand, the Odyssey is a Microsoft Windows-based device. It specifically shipped with the Windows Phone 8 operating system. It was offered through Verizon Wireless and US Cellular. The device was sold by Verizon for $9.99 with a two-year contract.
The Samsung Ativ Odyssey was first released in January 2013.  It has a 4-inch Super AMOLED display and runs on a Qualcomm MSM8960 Snapdragon S4 Plus chipset. The standby battery can last up to 168 hours, and the talk time can last up to 19 hours. The camera has 5 MP, autofocus, and LED flash. It also features geo-tagging.
After the product's release, the reception was mixed. Brian Bennett from CNET described it as: "Windows Phone 8 at a low price, but not much else". On the other hand, there are reviews that claimed it is a budget device that performs like a flagship phone.
