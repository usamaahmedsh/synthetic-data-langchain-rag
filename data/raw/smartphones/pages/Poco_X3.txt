The Poco X3, Poco X3 NFC and Poco X3 Pro are Android-based smartphones developed by Xiaomi, announced on 7 and 22 September 2020 (X3/NFC on 7–22 September, and X3 Pro in March 2021). All three feature a 6.67 in (169 mm) FHD+ IPS LCD display with 120 Hz refresh rate, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and quad‑camera setups: the original X3 includes a 64 MP main and 13 MP ultra‑wide, whereas the X3 NFC and X3 Pro use a 48 MP main and 8 MP ultra‑wide sensor, alongside 2 MP macro and depth sensors. They all house a 5160 mAh battery (the X3 non‑NFC variant had 6000 mAh), up to 8 GB RAM, and run on Snapdragon 732 G (X3 and X3 NFC) or 860 (X3 Pro) chipsets.
At launch, the X3/X3 NFC ran MIUI 12 based on Android 10, and the X3 Pro shipped with MIUI 12 on Android 11. Over time, updates brought them to MIUI 13 on Android 12 for X3/X3 Pro, and MIUI 14 on Android 12 for X3 NFC; the X3 Pro has since received MIUI 14 on Android 13.
These devices received criticism over PMIC (power management IC) reliability issues—faulty PMICs could lead to bricking due to charging failure or memory corruption, and Xiaomi acknowledged the issue, offering extended warranty support in some regions. Many users resolved it by rebooting into fastboot to recalibrate the PMIC

== Criticism ==
The Poco X3 Pro and maybe the Poco X3 NFC had a faulty PMIC, which eventually caused the phone to not charge and the memory chip to corrupt, rendering the phone bricked, as you need an authorized Mi account to flash using EDL. Contrary to popular belief it affected both the Indian and the EEA variants. A temporary fix was rebooting the phone into fastboot, which caused a "recalibration" of the PMIC. Xiaomi confirmed the issue and gave another 6 months of warranty to the Indian version.
Lot of screens were defect, which caused ghost touch issues and random wake-ups. Sometimes it corresponded with a PMIC failure which caused some to believe that the PMIC caused these issues, although Xiaomi has not acknowledged it.
