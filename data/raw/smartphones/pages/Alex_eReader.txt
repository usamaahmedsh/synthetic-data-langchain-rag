== Features ==
The Alex e-reader combines two displays, a larger E Ink display mainly for reading, and a smaller color LCD touchscreen for browsing. Comparing the Alex with the nook e-reader, the smaller LCD screen is used for more than navigation. One can view content on either screen and use a button to change the display back and forth between the E Ink screen and color screen. The color screen is used to annotate text with the text on the EPD screen highlighted in gray whenever there is a highlight, text or voice annotation, or hyperlink to other materials.
The Alex reader includes applications such as a book reader, mp3 player, web browser, tools to manage annotations of e-reader content, an email client and a calculator.  It also allows recording voice comments and adding hyperlinks.
