The Oppo Find X7 is a series of two Android-based smartphones manufactured by Oppo as part of its flagship Find X series. Unveiled as successors to the Oppo Find X6 series, both phones were launched on 8 January 2024. Just like its predecessor, the Find X6 series, the Find X7 series were released exclusively for the mainland Chinese market.

The Find X7 series consists of two devices — the regular Find X7 and the top of the line Find X7 Ultra. As the first “Ultra” phone in the flagship Find X series, the Find X7 Ultra is also being touted as the first phone to incorporate two periscope telephoto cameras.

Both the Find X7 and the Find X7 Ultra feature curved displays and aluminium frames. The Find X7 features a curved 6.78 in (172 mm) display, while the Find X7 Ultra has a slightly larger 6.82 in (173 mm) screen with a higher 1440p resolution. Both display systems are 10-bit HDR10+ capable. The Find X7 is IP65 protected, while the Find X7 Ultra features IP68 water and dust resistance.
The Find X7 smartphone is available in four different colour options, namely Black, Ocean Blue, Sepia Brown and Purple. The Black and Purple variants have all-glass back panels, while the Ocean Blue and Sepia Brown colour options come with dual-tone glass and vegan leather design. The Find X7 Ultra is available in Ocean Blue, Sepia Brown and Tailored Black colourways, all of which feature similar dual-tone glass and leather backs.
The Find X7 series is the first within Oppo's Find X line-up to introduce an alert slider, a design copied from the company's subsidiary OnePlus.
