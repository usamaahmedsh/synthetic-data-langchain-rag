The Nokia Lumia 530 is an entry-level smartphone developed by Nokia and released by Microsoft Mobile that runs the Windows Phone 8.1 operating system. It was succeeded by the Microsoft Lumia 535, just three months after its release.


== Hardware ==
The Lumia 530 comes in a slate form factor with 4-inch touchscreen. The viewing angles are slightly reduced compared to other phones in the Lumia line.


== Software ==
The Lumia 530 ships with Microsoft Windows Phone 8.1, as well as exclusive software like Nokia Mix Radio and HERE Maps (featuring turn-by-turn directions, offline maps and navigation, and transit info).


== Reception ==
Ars Technica and PC Advisor considered the Lumia 530 a downgrade from the Lumia 520, noting the lack of a dedicated camera button and auto-focus, a lower-quality display, and lower-end GPU. The limited amount of RAM made some games unplayable and crippled multitasking.


== Variants ==
There are two dual sim variants: RM-1019 and RM-1020
