Redmi K30 Pro is a line of Android-based smartphones manufactured by Xiaomi and marketed under its Redmi sub-brand. There are four models, the K30 Pro, K30 Pro Zoom, K30 Ultra and the Poco F2 Pro, which is a rebranded version of the K30 Pro.
The company discontinued the smartphone's sale in favor of the successor Redmi K40 Pro lineup in 2021.

The K30 Pro line uses an anodized aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass on the front and back. Both the volume and power buttons are located on the right edge; the latter has a red accent. The front-facing camera is concealed by a motorized pop-up mechanism like on the K20 Pro. The camera protrusion on the back panel is a single unit with a dual-LED flash below, and a circular module. Colors available at launch were (Cyber) Grey, (Electric) Purple, (Phantom) White and (Neon) Blue. The K30 Ultra has unique Moonlight White, Midnight Black and Mint Green finishes.

==== Camera ====
The wide sensor on all variants has been upgraded from a Sony IMX586 48 MP sensor to a Sony IMX686 64 MP sensor and now features an extra depth sensor. The K30 Pro Zoom benefits from the usage of optical image stabilization on the wide lens. It has an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, while the K30 Pro and Poco F2 Pro have a 5 MP "telemacro" lens which has twice the focal length of a standard macro lens. Both are accompanied by a 13 MP ultrawide sensor. The front-facing camera uses a motorized pop-up Samsung S5K3T2 20 MP sensor,  f/2.2, (wide), 1/3.4", 0.8 μm with HDR.
