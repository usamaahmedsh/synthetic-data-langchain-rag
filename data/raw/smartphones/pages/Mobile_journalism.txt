Mobile journalism is a form of multimedia newsgathering and storytelling that enables journalists to document, edit and share news using small, network connected devices like smartphones.
Mobile journalists report in video, audio, photography, and graphics using apps on their portable devices.
Such reporters, sometimes known as  mojos (for mobile journalist), are staff or freelance journalists who may use digital cameras and camcorders, laptop PCs, smartphones or tablet devices.  A broadband wireless connection, satellite phone, or cellular network is then used to transmit the story and imagery for publication.
The term mojo has been in use since 2005, originating at the Fort Myers News-Press and then gaining popularity throughout the Gannett newspaper chain in the United States.
Some key benefits of mobile journalism in comparison to conventional methods include affordability, portability, discretion, approachability, and the ease of access for beginners.
