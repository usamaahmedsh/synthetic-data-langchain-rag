The Samsung Galaxy Z series (named as Samsung Galaxy Foldables in certain territories) is a line of foldable smartphones manufactured by Samsung Electronics since 2019, part of the wider range of Samsung Galaxy products. The Z series consists of smartphones running Android with flexible displays, namely the Z Fold line of book-style foldables and the Z Flip line of clamshell-style ("flip phone") foldables.


== History ==
In 2018, Samsung announced the Galaxy X prototype before manufacture and release of the foldable under the new name Galaxy Fold in 2019. With the 2020 announcement of the Galaxy Z Flip, Samsung's future foldable smartphones are part of the Galaxy Z series. Unlike the Galaxy Fold, the Z Flip folds vertically and uses a hybrid glass coating branded as "In“inity Flex Display”. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G is the second generation of Samsung's inward fold design introduced with the original Fold. It features a significantly larger front screen than its predecessor, a high refresh rate 120 Hz folding screen, minimal bezels and improved cameras. 
In March 2022, Samsung began to rebrand the Galaxy Fold and Flip devices in Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) to remove the “Z” branding from their names. This is due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as the letter “Z” has been used as a symbol by the Russian military and as a pro-war symbol by the Russian government.
