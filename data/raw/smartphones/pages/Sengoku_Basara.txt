Sengoku Basara (戦国BASARA) is a series of video games developed and published by Capcom, and a bigger media franchise based on it, including three anime shows, an anime movie, a live action show, and numerous drama CDs, light novels, manga, and stage plays. Its story is loosely based on real events of the titular Sengoku period in the history of feudal Japan. Sengoku Basara was popular in Japan when the games were released as they won multiple awards, became a cultural phenomenon and a commonly cited example of games as art, and gained a passionate fanbase.
While Sengoku Basara was mainly popular in Japan, it did gain some popularity in other countries in Asia. Despite being considered niche outside of Asia, it does maintain a small following in other countries. The franchise started with the first Sengoku Basara video game being released in Japan on July 21, 2005, for the PlayStation 2.
Sengoku Basara's producer was Hiroyuki Kobayashi (who was the producer for every console and handheld game in the series except for Sengoku Basara Sanada Yukimura-den, and is the creator of the franchise), and its director was Makoto Yamamoto (who was the director for every console and handheld game in the series except for Sengoku Basara Sanada Yukimura-den). Sengoku Basara serves as one of Capcom's flagship series in Japan. As of December 31, 2023, the game series has sold 4.1 million copies worldwide.

Several manga adaptations of the series have been serialized in manga magazines, and were later released in tankōbon format in Japan. A manga adaptation of the second game was created by Yak Haibara. The four volume series, Sengoku Basara 2, was published in Japan from 2007-2009. It was published in the United States from 2012-2013 by UDON under the title Sengoku Basara: Samurai Legends. The title change was due to the Sengoku Basara 2 video game not having been released in the United States. Kairi Shimotsuki created the first manga adaptation of the series, based on the first game, which was titled, Sengoku Basara Ranse Ranbu, and was released as a three-volume series in 2006.
Radio shows have been produced, with the first series being released on four CD volumes.

The stage play received "universal acclaim" in Japan. This stage play is considered to be the beginning of the Sengoku Basara stage play series' huge success and popularity in Japan with later stage plays in the series becoming even more successful and popular. There has been a total of 17 stage plays in the series as of 2019, with Capcom doing 1-2 per year (1 in 2009, 1 in 2010, 1 in 2011, 2 in 2012, 2 in 2013, 2 in 2014, 1 in 2015, 2 in 2016, 2 in 2017, 2 in 2018, and 1 in 2019).
