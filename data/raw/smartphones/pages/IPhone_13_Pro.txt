== History ==


=== Before announcement ===
The successor to the iPhone 12 Pro models began in development to make the size of the notch 20% smaller as thanks to the front-firing speaker placed into the upper edge from the True-Depth sensor housing and utilizing the display refresh rate up to 120 Hz for smoother motion found. According to the early released rumors, the color options of the iPhone 13 Pro models were including Sunset Gold (a new Gold color option), Rosé (a rename of Gold), Pearl (rename of the Silver) and Matte Black. However, Apple Inc. announced that no Sunset Gold color option of the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max would be unveiled, which Sierra Blue color option of the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max would be instead unveiled on the September Event.


=== After announcement ===
The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max were officially announced alongside the ninth-generation iPad, 6th generation iPad Mini, Apple Watch Series 7, iPhone 13, and iPhone 13 Mini by a virtual press event filmed and recorded at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 14, 2021. Pre-orders began on September 17 at 5:00 AM PST. Pricing starts at US$999 for the iPhone 13 Pro and US$1099 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the same as their respective previous generations.

In the same year, this phone was the last generation of iPhone to be on sale in Russia before the suspension of sales for newer generations in the country due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
In March 2023, Apple began selling refurbished iPhone 13 Pro models on their official website.
The phone was manufactured on contract by Foxconn and Luxshare.


== Design ==

The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max's design is mostly unchanged from their respective predecessors. However, the rear camera module now covers a larger area due to the larger lenses. The Face ID and camera module on the front display, or "notch", is now 20% smaller than in previous generations.
The back side of the iPhone 13 Pro is made of a matte glass finish and the front is protected by Gorilla Glass.
The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are available in five colors: Silver, Graphite, Gold, Sierra Blue, and Alpine Green. Sierra Blue is a new color replacing Pacific Blue.
On March 8, 2022, at Apple's Special Event "Peek Performance", Apple revealed a new Alpine Green color option, which became available on March 18, 2022.


== Specifications ==


=== Hardware ===
The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max use an Apple-designed A15 Bionic processor featuring a 16-core neural engine, 6-core CPU (with 2 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores), and 5-core GPU. The A15 Bionic also contains a new image processor. 
The iPhone 13 Pro got an Antutu Score, or Antutu Benchmark Score of 846,433, which makes its graphic loading smooth.
More 5G bands are available to support more carriers, especially outside the US.


==== Display ====
The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.06 inch (154 mm) (marketed as 6.1-inch (150 mm)) OLED display with a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels (2.9 megapixels) at 460 PPI, while the iPhone 13 Pro Max has a 6.68 inch (170 mm) (marketed as 6.7-inch (170 mm)) OLED display with a resolution of 2778 × 1284 pixels (3.5 megapixels) at 458 PPI. Both models have the Super Retina XDR OLED display with improved typical brightness up to 1,000 nits from 800 nits, and max brightness up to 1,200 nits, and a variable 10–120 Hz ProMotion display, which can also go as low as 10 Hz to preserve battery. The ProMotion name was previously used on the iPad Pro (2nd Generation) and later models.


==== Battery ====
Apple claims up to 1.5 more hours of battery life on the iPhone 13 Pro, and 2.5 more hours on the 13 Pro Max than their respective predecessors. Rated capacities are 11.97 Wh (3,095 mAh) on the iPhone 13 Pro an increase from the 10.78 Wh (2,815 mAh) battery found in the iPhone 12 Pro, while the iPhone 13 Pro Max is rated at 16.75 Wh (4,352 mAh) another increase from the 14.13 Wh (3,687 mAh) battery found in the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Both models can charge with MagSafe up to 15 W, Qi wireless charging up to 7.5 W, and Lightning up to 20-23 W for the Pro model, 20-27 W for the Pro Max model.


==== Camera ====
The iPhone 13 Pro features four cameras: one front-facing camera for selfie and three rear-facing cameras which includes a telephoto, wide, and ultra-wide camera. The rear-facing cameras all contain larger sensors than the iPhone 12 Pro, allowing for more light-gathering. The wide and ultra-wide also have larger apertures to capture more light and increase low-light performance. The ultra-wide camera also has autofocus for the first time. The 77 mm telephoto has a smaller aperture than the 12 Pro's, but has the advantage of being able to use Night Mode. The larger telephoto also increases the digital zoom capability to 15x.
The cameras use a new computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Smart HDR 4 processes recognized faces in photos separately using local adjustments. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different than a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image.
The camera app contains a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create a shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide, telephoto, and front-facing cameras in 1080p at 30 fps. Apple also added in iOS 15.1 the ability to record in Apple ProRes 4K at 30 fps and 1080p at 60 fps for models with at least 256 GB of storage, however base models with 128 GB of storage will be limited to ProRes recording at 1080p at 30 fps.
The camera features a macro mode that can focus as close as 2 centimeters from a subject. It utilizes the autofocus from the ultra-wide camera and is automatically enabled when close enough to a subject.


=== Software ===

iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max originally shipped with iOS 15. They received the iOS 16 update, which was released on September 12, 2022, and iOS 17, which was released on September 18, 2023. The Qi2 wireless charging standard has been added to the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max with the update to iOS 17.2.  They are also compatible with iOS 18 released in late 2024.
These phones support the current public release of iOS, which is currently iOS 26.
