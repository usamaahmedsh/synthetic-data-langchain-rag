== History ==
In 1995, AT&T Corporation renamed their subsidiary AT&T Technologies to Lucent Technologies and spun it off in 1996. Lucent subsequently spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.
Avaya Inc. was spun off from Lucent as its own company in 2000 (Lucent merged with Alcatel SA in 2006, becoming Alcatel-Lucent, which was purchased in turn by Nokia in 2016). Avaya Inc. were listed on the NYSE using the symbol AV from 2000 to 2007. In October 2007, Avaya Inc. was acquired for $8.2 billion by Sierra Holdings Corp owned by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners. On June 6, 2011 Sierra Holdings Corp. was renamed Avaya Holdings Corp.
In May 2001, certain Avaya, Inc products and manufacturing processes were acquired by Celestica. The locations of Avaya's Denver, Colorado and Little Rock, Arkansas were for Celestica to supply telecommunications products such as printed circuit boards and systems repair, test, and assembly. This acquisition of Avaya's certain assets were for Celestica to establish a five-year contract in manufacturing outsourcing partnership and supply chain management for a more diverse telecommunication products for Celestica and become Avaya's Electronics manufacturing services contractor.
On November 19, 2014, Avaya was confirmed as the naming rights partner for the San Jose Earthquakes' new stadium, officially called Avaya Stadium, paying $20 million over a 10-year deal.
On January 19, 2017, Avaya Inc. and related affiliates including Avaya Holdings Corp. petitioned for protection from creditors during reorganizing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. A restructuring plan for Avaya Holdings Corp. agreed upon during mediation was given effect by the court's order November 28, 2017.
In December 2017, Avaya requested a federal judge to reduce their commitment to the Earthquakes' stadium name agreement. After Avaya vacated their naming rights, the venue was renamed Earthquakes Stadium in 2020 and PayPal Park in 2021 after PayPal bought the naming rights.

On February 14, 2023, Avaya once again petitioned for protection from creditors during restructuring under Chapter 11 with a restructuring plan already agreed on with their creditors. On February 15, 2023 the NYSE announced that shares of Avaya no longer qualified for listing on the New York Exchange and would cease to be traded there. Although the proposed restructuring plan would wipe out the shares, several securities dealers announced that they would begin making a market in Avaya shares effective February 16, 2023 using the symbol AVYAQ and trading 'over the counter', i.e. a securities dealer is a counterparty of each trade. On May 1, 2023, Avaya Holdings Corp. completed its financial restructuring, emerging from bankruptcy owned by its former creditors as the private company Avaya LLC.
