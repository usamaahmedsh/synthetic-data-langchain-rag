The BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9983 is a high-end smartphone by BlackBerry and Porsche Design. Announced in September 2014 and released the following month, the device combines BlackBerry 10.3 software with a compact square touchscreen and hardware QWERTY keyboard aimed at the luxury segment.
Like the BlackBerry Q10, on which it is based, the P'9983 features a 3.1 inch 720×720 display, 1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, 2 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD card. The handset ships with BlackBerry 10.3 preinstalled, including features such as BlackBerry Hub, BlackBerry Assistant and built-in access to the Amazon Appstore for Android applications.
Porsche Design reworked the exterior of the phone with a stainless steel frame, distinctive straight-edged lines and a back cover with a glass-weave style finish, along with a sculpted QWERTY keyboard that uses a custom typeface and glass-like key tops. The rear camera module is protected by a sapphire glass lens cover, and the phone was sold at a significantly higher price than the Q10, positioning it as a luxury device.
As with the earlier P'9982, buyers of the P'9983 received a unique BlackBerry PIN format reserved for Porsche Design devices, grouping them into an identifiable PIN range when using BBM. The P'9983 later saw a "Graphite" variant with darker metal accents and updated back materials marketed as an even more exclusive edition.
