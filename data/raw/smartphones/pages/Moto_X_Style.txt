The Style was announced on July 28, 2015, at a press event in New York City, announced alongside its counterparts the Moto X Play and the Moto G (3rd generation).
In the United States, the phone was not offered through any carrier subsidiaries and would be released unlocked, offering the consumer quicker software updates, avoiding carrier input.
