== Reviews ==
Reviews of the ZTE Blade have been positive due to the number of features offered while maintaining a low price. The screen in particular received praise, while the camera/camcorder quality was identified as one of the few downsides to the device.


== Community reception ==

In the annual handset opinion survey of The Best non-htc Device of 2010, organised by xda-developers forum, the ZTE Blade won a total of 24.66% votes, placing it first among the 32 handsets including Samsung Galaxy S and Google's flagship phone Nexus S, placing them on the second and third position right behind ZTE Blade, as judged by forum users.
Various websites, mainly MoDaCo and xda-developers, have created a very large modifications scene around the Blade. Offering various custom ROMs (such as de-branded ROMs, for the re-branded devices) which remove all software that phone companies put on the device like applications and games, etc., or upgraded software versions (like Froyo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, or Jelly Bean) which do not come on the device in its stock configuration. Users who flash custom ROMs void their warranty and take risks in doing so, however it is possible to restore the original stock ROM.

Android 2.2 (Froyo) is appearing on the Blade but with only certain carriers/re-branded devices. It is also available through custom ROMs such as Swedish Spring and an improved version, Portuguese Spring.
Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) has also been released on the Blade through CyanogenMod 7, and modified ROMs originally made for the ZTE Libra.
Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is being worked on through ColdfusionX, unofficial CyanogenMod 9, ICS4blade project, and later several builds and ports of modified ROMs like AOKP (Android Open Kang Project) or MIUI V4.
Android 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 (Jelly Bean) is available as an unofficial port of CyanogenMod 10, 10.1, 10.2 and several builds and ports of another popular aftermarket ROMs like AOKP (Android Open Kang Project), Paranoid Android, or MIUI V4.1.
Android 4.4 (KitKat) based on CyanogenMod 11 is also available for testing, but it's work in progress (both Blade port and CyanogenMod 11 itself) and not suitable for daily use, yet.
At first, because of the lack of essential components such as OpenMAX libraries for ARMv6, Blade running Android 4.0+ lacks hardware video acceleration. However, the fix has been found and the current Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean ROMs can be considered as fairly stable ROM for daily use, as all the major features have worked and been fixed.
