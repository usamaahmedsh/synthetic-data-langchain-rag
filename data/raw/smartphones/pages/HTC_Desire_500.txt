NotebookCheck reviewed the HTC Desire 500. It was noted that the MicroSD slot and the removable battery were certainly two important features of the HTC Desire 500, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini and quite the opposite of the HTC One Mini. High brightness and high viewing angles of the display were praised but the processor performance was criticized.
PhoneArena reviewed the HTC Desire 500. Photo quality, design, and call quality were considered the pros and uncomfortable physical keys and lack of backlighting on the capacitive keys were considered the cons of the device.
GSMArena reviewed the HTC Desire 500. WVGA display resolution, mediocre video recording, lack of Full HD video recording, poor video codec support of the default video player, and limited internal storage were considered as the main disadvantages of the device.
