== CeBIT Appearance ==
Meizu appeared at CeBIT on March 4, 2008, with a non-functional, plastic prototype of the M8 able to display three screenshots of the UI, and a development board running a partially working UI with most common phone functions. No fully working unit was shown, however.
On the second day of the exhibition, March 5, German police raided 51 booths including Meizu, where a newly developed MP3 player thought to infringe a Fraunhofer Society patent was confiscated.


== Production Halt ==
On October 9, 2010, it was reported that Meizu had shut down production of the M8 due to pressure from the Intellectual Property Offices and Apple Inc. because of its close similarities to the iPhone. Apple also was looking to ban all sales of the M8 as well, which some media outlets have speculated could bankrupt the company due to losses from unsold inventory, but no official word on this has been heard.
