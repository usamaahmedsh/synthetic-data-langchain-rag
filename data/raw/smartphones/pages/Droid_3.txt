The Motorola Droid 3 is a smartphone released on July 7, 2011, by Verizon Wireless running the Android 2.3 operating system by Google. It comes with 16 GB of internal storage. The smartphone does not ship with a microSD card. It has a 4-inch qHD display and an 8-megapixel camera capable of recording 1080p video. Unlike the Droid 2, the Motorola Droid 3 features a 5-row QWERTY keyboard, with a dedicated number row. It also has a VGA front-facing camera for video calls.  The Droid 3 ships with Android 2.3.4 (Gingerbread) with Motorola's updated proprietary Motoblur UI.  Like other contemporary Motorola phones, it has a locked bootloader, but TWRP can be installed using the SafeStrap exploit, which allows custom ROMs to be installed. The GSM/UMTS version of the Droid 3 was known as the Milestone 3.


== Software updates ==
The Droid 3 received its first OTA system-wide software update on September 30, 2011. A new update, version 5.7.894, leaked on November 6, 2011 and was made available for download. It has not been released as an OTA update. Other versions have leaked, but some were pulled after some phones were rendered unusable after installation. The version listed above is not one that rendered phones useless.
Through January and February, 3 more OTA updates leaked. Versions 5.7.902, 5.7.905 and 5.7.906 were released through January and February 2012. On March 7, 2012, Motorola sent out emails to Motorola Feedback Network members to test a new software update.  The update began rolling out on March 9, 2012.
While the Droid 3 did not receive anything later than Android 2.3.6 officially, The Droid 3 would receive custom ROMs for Android Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean, and KitKat. The Milestone 3 did not get custom ROMs for Jellybean or KitKat. While a Droid 3 Jellybean or KitKat ROM can be installed on the Milestone 3, it has trouble booting, and the performance is poor.
