The Samsung Galaxy A53 5G is a mid-range Android smartphone developed and manufactured by Samsung Electronics as a part of its Galaxy A series. The phone was announced on 17 March 2022 at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event alongside the Galaxy A33 5G and Galaxy A73 5G.
The A53 runs on Samsung's Exynos 1280 processor and has a quad-camera system featuring a 64 MP main camera with a 32 MP front camera. The Galaxy A53 is the first device in Samsung's A series to receive 4 OS upgrades and 5 years of software updates.


== Design ==

The display is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 5. The back panel and side are made of frosted plastic. It was also the last A5x device to have a plastic back, after its successor began to use a glass back.
The design of the Galaxy A53 looks almost similar to its predecessor, but the rear panel is now completely flat, and the transition between the rear panel and the camera unit is smoother. 
Below is a USB-C connector, speaker, and microphone. Depending on the version, the phone has either a slot for 1 SIM card and microSD memory card up to 1 TB or a hybrid slot for 2 SIM cards.  The second microphone is located on top.  On the right side are the volume buttons and the smartphone lock button. It is the first A5x device to drop the 3.5mm headset jack.
The smartphone is sold in 4 colors: Awesome Black, Awesome White, Awesome Blue, and Awesome Peach.
