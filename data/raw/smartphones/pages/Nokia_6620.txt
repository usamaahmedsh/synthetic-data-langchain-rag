The 6620 is a mobile phone created by Nokia, announced in 2004, running on Series 60 2nd Edition and the Symbian operating system. It was the first EDGE-capable phone for the Americas' market.
It is a version of Nokia's 6600 smartphone for the North American market, with all the features of the 6600 such as the VGA camera, MultiMediaCard slot, Bluetooth and color screen, but with a change to the North American GSM frequencies, newer version  of Nokia Series 60 v2 with Feature Pack 1 (the original 6600 had common Series 60 v2 without Feature Packs), the doubling of internal RAM, the addition of Nokia's new Pop-Port connector, the inclusion of stereo sound, and a new EDGE capability, effectively giving it double the download speeds of contemporary General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)-equipped phones. Although not officially designed as a successor, it replaced the Nokia 3620 in the Cingular Wireless (now AT&T Mobility) lineup shortly after their acquisition of AT&T Wireless Services.
This phone usually came packaged with a charger, battery, 32-megabyte MMC card and USB cable.
