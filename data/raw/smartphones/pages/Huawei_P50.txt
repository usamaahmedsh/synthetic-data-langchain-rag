The Huawei P50 series features Leica optics. The wide lens on P50 and P50 Pro is a new "True-Form" 50 MP IMX766 sensor. Unlike the P40, whose wide lens uses an "Ultra Super Spectrum" image sensor, the P50 uses a traditional RGGB sensor instead.
The P50's rear camera array consists of a 50 MP wide lens, a 13 MP 16 mm ultrawide lens and an 12 MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. For P50 Pro, 50 MP wide lens now has optical image stabilization. The 13 MP ultrawide is now wider in 13 mm, the periscope telephoto now has a 64 MP sensor at 3.5x and an additional 40 MP monochrome sensor to capture more light.
The software is also improved with a new Golden Snap feature that takes a burst of HDR+ photos and automatically picks the best shots. A Profoto studio light will be available as an accessory as well.
