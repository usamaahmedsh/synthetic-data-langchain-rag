The phone has a triple-lens camera composing of a 48 MP f/2.0 wide-angle lens, 8 MP f/2.2 ultra-wide angle lens with a 123° field of view, and a 5 MP 3D depth sensor. The 3D depth sensor can work with the other lenses to simulate a Bokeh effect through a “live focus” mode. There is a 32 MP f/2.0 frontal camera also supporting the live focus mode.

=== Software ===
The Galaxy A90 runs on Android Pie with Samsung's One UI skin, similar to other Samsung phones released in 2019, that repositions the touch area in stock Samsung apps towards the bottom.
