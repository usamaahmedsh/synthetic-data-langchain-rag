The Xperia 8 resembles the Xperia 10, but has an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and back. The screen has asymmetrical bezels, with the top bezel housing the earpiece, front-facing camera, notification LED and various sensors. The power button/fingerprint sensor and volume buttons are located on the right side of the device, while the 3.5mm headphone jack is located on the top. Notably, the shutter release button has been omitted. The rear cameras are centered and located near the top of the phone, with the LED flash above. The bottom edge has the primary microphone and a downward-firing speaker next to the USB-C port. At 158 mm × 69 mm × 8.1 mm and 170g (5.99 oz), the device is marginally larger and heavier than the 10 while seeing a slight decrease in depth.
