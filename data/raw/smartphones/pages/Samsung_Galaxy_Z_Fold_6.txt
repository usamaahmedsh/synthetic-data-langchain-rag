The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 (stylized as Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6) is a foldable smartphone developed by Samsung Electronics. Officially announced on July 10, 2024, at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris, France, alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Buds 3 series and Galaxy Ring. It succeeded the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and became available on July 31, 2024.

On October 21, 2024, Samsung announced a derivative model, the Galaxy Z Fold SE (Special Edition), featuring a larger display, a slimmer and lighter body, and a 200 MP main camera. This model was released exclusively in South Korea.


== Design and form factor ==
Compared to its predecessor, the Galaxy Z Fold 5, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 features a more squared-off design in its display and body, closely resembling the Galaxy S24 Ultra. The camera rings incorporate concentric circle detailing for a refined aesthetic. The cover screen and back panel are constructed with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, while the inner display uses Samsung's ultra-thin flexible glass (UTG). The device holds an IP48 rating, making it Samsung's first foldable smartphone with certified dust protection. Its frame is made of matte aluminum and does not include a titanium frame, unlike the Galaxy S24 Ultra.
The Z Fold 6 is available in five colors: Silver Shadow, Pink, Navy, Crafted Black, and White. Among these, Crafted Black and White are exclusive to online channels. Notably, the Crafted Black variant features a carbon fiber pattern finish.


=== Flex mode ===
Flex Mode is a feature available on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 that utilizes the device's foldable hinge mechanism to enable split-screen functionality when the device is partially folded, typically between 75 and 115 degrees.
In this configuration, supported applications display content on the upper half of the screen, while interactive controls appear on the lower half. For example, in apps such as YouTube, Samsung Notes, and video conferencing platforms, users can view content or calls on the top screen while accessing playback tools, editing options, or a virtual touchpad below. Flex Mode enables a split-screen interface when the device is partially folded, allowing users to interact with different parts of an application simultaneously. It is designed to support multitasking by utilizing the device's foldable structure.
