== Operations and Services ==
MailTime is a messenger application built on top of the email protocol. Its content parsing engine removes signatures, repeated metadata from the traditional email formats, and displays emails in a conversation view, resembling instant messengers’ bubble chat view. By doing so, it hopes to make those messages more manageable, easier to read, and quicker to respond to. The content engine also summarizes long emails in a way that places messages into a conversation view. Emails that include multiple participants are displayed like a group chat, enabling users to reply-all or easily add and remove people from the conversation.
Its compatibility with the email protocol makes it an open messenger without forcing users’ contacts to download the same application to message.

The MailTime application supports a number of email services including Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook.com, iCloud, Google Apps, Office 365, AOL, Mail.Ru, Netease 163, and Tencent QQ Mail.
