Nothing Technology Limited (stylised as NOTHING) is a British consumer electronics company headquartered in London. It was founded in 2020 by Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus. The company develops smartphones, audio products, and related software, positioning itself as a design-focused challenger brand.
Nothing released its first product, the Ear (1) wireless earbuds, in July 2021, followed by its debut smartphone, the Phone (1), in 2022. The company has since released successive generations, including the Phone (2), Ear (2), and in 2025 the Phone (3) and Ear (3). Alongside its flagship devices, the company introduced CMF by Nothing, a budget-oriented sub-brand that was spun off as a separate company in 2025.
Nothing’s devices run Nothing OS, a customised version of Android, and are distributed in markets including Europe, India, and North America. The company has raised venture funding from GV (formerly Google Ventures), EQT Ventures, and Tiger Global, along with high-profile individual investors including Tony Fadell and Casey Neistat. Its products are noted for their transparent hardware designs and the Glyph Interface, a system of LED lighting on the rear of its smartphones.


== History ==
Nothing was founded by Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus, who left the company in October 2020 and raised $7 million from investors including Tony Fadell, Kevin Lin, Steve Huffman, and Casey Neistat. The company was officially announced in January 2021, and soon acquired the brand assets of Essential Products. It also partnered with Teenage Engineering, the Stockholm-based electronics company known for its product design.
The company launched its first product, the transparent ear (1) wireless earbuds, in July 2021. It later secured $50 million in funding and announced a partnership with Qualcomm.
In 2022, Nothing raised $70 million in Series B funding, and introduced its first smartphone, the phone (1), featuring a distinctive LED-based Glyph Interface. The company also opened a physical retail store in London’s Soho district in December.
In 2023, it released the ear (2) earbuds and previewed smartphones using Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipsets. The company also launched "CMF by Nothing", a sub-brand focused on affordable, design-led products.
In November 2023, Nothing faced backlash over a messaging app that claimed to offer end-to-end encryption but was discovered to store messages in plaintext. The app was withdrawn within 24 hours.
Shortly afterward, the company raised $96 million in a Series B1 funding round led by Highland Europe.
By 2024, Nothing had surpassed $1 billion in lifetime sales, doubling annual revenue to over $500 million and selling more than 7 million devices. In India, it became the fastest-growing smartphone brand, with over 577% year-on-year growth. The CMF Phone 1, featuring a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor and modular customization, launched in July 2024.
On March 4 2025, the company introduced the Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro, a pair of mid-range smartphones powered by Snapdragon 7s Gen 3. Alongside the release of the phones came a new software feature known as “Essential Space”, an AI powered tool designed to assist the user with various organisational tasks. This feature was also included on the budget CMF Phone 2 Pro, announced on 28 April 2025, and launched on May 6 2025.
The company revealed the flagship Phone (3) as its successor to the Phone (2), along with over-ear headphones, dubbed Headphone (1), at a launch event on 1 July 2025.
In September 2025, Nothing announced it would spin-off CMF into a standalone company based in India.

=== Applications ===


==== Essential Space ====
Essential Space is an AI-powered content management feature developed by Nothing Technology Limited, introduced with the launch of the Nothing Phone (3a) series in March 2025. Designed to act as a "second memory," Essential Space enables users to capture, organize, and retrieve digital content such as screenshots, voice notes, and photos through a dedicated hardware button known as the Essential Key.


==== Nothing Chats ====
Nothing Chats was an instant messaging application released by Nothing Technology Limited. It was briefly available on Google Play in November 2023 before being withdrawn due to reports of bugs, insecure networking, and reliability concerns.
On 14 November 2023, Nothing announced the app had been developed in collaboration with a company called Sunbird and would offer limited compatibility with Apple’s iMessage. Prior to launch, Android Authority and Ars Technica expressed skepticism about the app’s claims around end-to-end encryption and overall security, citing Sunbird’s track record. Ars Technica specifically warned against sharing Apple credentials with a third party that might not fully grasp the associated risks. On 17 November, shortly after launch, a third-party developer discovered that the app was using a version of a rival open-source project called BlueBubbles but Sunbird failed to procure a TLS certificate so the application was sending users' service credentials via insecure HTTP. The vulnerability could allow a third-party to intercept users' credentials (one at a time) and use them to impersonate the users to read and send messages. On 18 November, a different user reported that the app was sending all media attachments, including user images to error-logging service Sentry, and all data to Firebase, with the data being stored unencrypted in both places. At the time, the Firebase database contained over 630,000 media files. 9to5Google confirmed that anyone can intercept the application's Firebase credentials (from their own device or any other device), log into Firebase and see all other users' past and real-time messages. Another party developed a script for downloading this data automatically and published the code to GitHub. Within 24 hours, Nothing removed the app from Google Play.


=== Drinks ===
Beer (5.1%) is a beer created by Nothing Technology. The beer was initially announced on 1 April 2023, and was made available in the UK in October 2023. The drink is brewed by Free time Beer Co., which is based in Wales.


== Reception and controversies ==
Nothing's products have generally been noted for their distinctive industrial design, transparent aesthetic, and brand identity. Reviewers have highlighted the company's focus on design differentiation and marketing, which have helped it stand out in a competitive smartphone market.  
At the same time, critics have pointed to challenges related to pricing, software maturity, and competition with larger manufacturers. The Phone (1) in particular was noted for software instability at launch and for delays in rolling out Android updates compared with competitors. Later devices received more positive reception on software stability, though Nothing’s update policy has been regarded as shorter than that of some larger manufacturers.  
In August 2025, the company faced criticism when it was discovered that several promotional images shown on demo units of the Phone (3) were in fact licensed stock photographs from the marketplace Stills, rather than photos taken with the device. Analysis of metadata confirmed the images had been captured on professional cameras before the phone’s release. Co-founder Akis Evangelidis stated that the images had been used as placeholders during staging and were mistakenly left on some demo units, calling the incident an "unfortunate oversight".
