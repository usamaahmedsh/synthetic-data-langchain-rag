Vivo X100 is a series of Android-based flagship smartphones developed and manufactured by Vivo. It is the successor to the Vivo X90 series in Vivo's premium X lineup. The series consists of three models: X100, X100 Pro, and X100 Ultra (released later in May 2024).


== Specifications ==


=== Design ===
The Vivo X100 features a curved AMOLED display with a center-aligned punch-hole camera. The rear camera module uses an asymmetrical "Sunset Eclipse" design with Zeiss branding. The frame is made of aluminum with IP68 rating for dust and water resistance.


=== Performance ===
The X100 is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 chipset, featuring an all-big-core design with four Cortex-X4 cores and four Cortex-A720 cores. It's paired with LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage. The phone scored over 2.2 million points in AnTuTu benchmarks at launch.

The triple camera system developed in partnership with Zeiss includes:

50MP main (1/1.31" Sony IMX920, f/1.57)

50MP ultrawide (115° FOV)
The system features Zeiss T* lens coating and supports 8K video recording. Vivo's V3 imaging chip enables advanced computational photography features like Night Vision and Astro Mode.

The X100 runs OriginOS 4 (Chinese models) or Funtouch OS 14 (global models) based on Android 14. It's promised to receive 3 major Android updates and 4 years of security patches.

The X100 received positive reviews for its camera performance and battery life. TechRadar praised its "outstanding low-light photography" and "excellent battery longevity", while noting the lack of wireless charging as a drawback.
