The Siam 7x is an Android dual-screen smartphone which launched in December 2015 and was designed by Darius Allen. This phone was the first phone produced by CRBT Siam, and the first dual-screen phone to be marketed to American consumers.


== History ==
Several manufacturers, including Samsung, LG and Kyocera had made attempts to create a dual-screen smartphone. However, they proved unsuccessful as their second screens were located within a difficult to access clam-shell design. The Siam 7x overcame this by placing the second screen on the outside, using a black and white E Ink Corporation screen to conserve power. A similar design was created by Yotaphone but its parent company targeted this phone to European, Asian and Middle Eastern markets. The Siam 7x was the first dual-screen phone designed for the North American market.
The phone was available only with the Android operating system, and only as a GSM carrier phone. It allows users to insert two SIM cards simultaneously. The phone was designed in Dallas, and manufactured in Shenzhen, China.
