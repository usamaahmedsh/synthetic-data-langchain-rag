=== History ===
The Xperia Z3 shipped with the Sony OEM version of Android 4.4.4 "KitKat". New additions to the bundled software include the Lifelog app, Sony Select, and support for Remote Play on the PlayStation 4 video game console. Android 5.0 "Lollipop" was first released for the Z3 in March 2015 in selected territories. Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" was first released in April 2016.
Developer preview builds of Android 7.0 "Nougat" were released for the Z3, but Sony stated that it was unable to release the final version due to "unforeseen platform limitations"; Qualcomm stated that it will not provide support for Nougat on any device using the Snapdragon 801 or 800 chipsets. The Adreno 330 GPU does not support the Vulkan or OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics APIs, which must be present in order to meet Google certification requirements for 7.0.
The Xperia Z3 was officially supported by LineageOS through versions 16.0 - 18.1, which correspond to Android releases 9 - 11. This means that the Xperia Z3 has (unofficially) supported seven major releases of Android.

=== Critical reception ===
The Xperia Z3 generally received positive reviews, with critics praising its durability, battery life and improved display. Although many critics argued that the Z3 is just a minor upgrade from the Z2 with not much differences. Pocket Lint criticised the device for the tall design and "occasional software excess" but praised its battery life. The Verge praised the design of the device for being attractive yet rugged, built out of better materials than the Galaxy S5, and also waterproof. The Guardian called the device the best smartphone Sony has ever made, with an improvement in feel and design over its predecessor. However, it criticised the Z3 for lack of wireless charging for something waterproof with "fiddly doors" covering the charging port is disappointing, but it has a magnetic charging port for an accessory dock.
