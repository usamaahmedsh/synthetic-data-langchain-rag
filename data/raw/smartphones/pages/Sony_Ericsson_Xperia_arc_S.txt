The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S (Xperia LT18i) is a high-end smartphone developed by Sony Ericsson running Google's operating system (OS) Android 2.3.4 (Gingerbread). It is an upgraded version of the Sony Xperia Arc. It is the last phone announced to carry the Sony Ericsson brand, although Sony Ericsson Xperia active was the last phone completed before Sony bought Ericsson's stake in the joint-venture.
Unveiled on 31 August 2011 at Sony's press conference in conjunction with IFA in Berlin, Germany and scheduled for release in October, it was released in October 2011. The device's primary improvements over its predecessor are a 1.4 GHz Scorpion Snapdragon CPU and 14.4 Mbit/s HSDPA, compared to the same model at 1.0 GHz and 7.2 Mbit/s HSDPA in the Arc. Aside from the CPU speed upgrade and HSDPA speed upgrade, additional hardware remains unchanged.
The Xperia arc S, along the Xperia Mini Pro, would not be receiving an Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update, as Sony Mobile Communications officially confirmed via their Facebook page on 26 July 2012. However, this statement was then retracted and Sony has issued a new statement stating they are investigating the possibility of software upgrades for the two devices. However, as of December 2015, the upgrade has not materialised.
