The Samsung SPH-M920 (marketed as the Samsung Transform) is an Android smartphone manufactured by Samsung. It was announced on October 6, 2010 and released on October 10, 2010 for Sprint in the United States.
The Samsung Transform was released using Android 2.1 (Eclair), but received an update to version 2.2.2 on March 25, 2011.
The Transform is one of the first devices to be equipped with Sprint's "Sprint ID" user interface. It's considered a mid-range smartphone and the successor to the Samsung Intercept with a few upgrades including faster data (EVDO Rev. A), a larger 3.5" inch touchscreen, and a VGA front-facing camera for video calling (expected to work with 2.2 update). The phone's form factor resembles that of the Samsung Epic 4G and is being offered as a 'budget minded' alternative.
