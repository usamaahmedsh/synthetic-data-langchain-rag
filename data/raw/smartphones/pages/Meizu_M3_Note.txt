=== Hardware and design ===
The Meizu M3 Note features a MediaTek Helio P10 system-on-a-chip with an array of eight ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores, an ARM Mali-T860 GPU and 2 GB or 3 GB of RAM. The M3 Note reaches a score of 50,000 points on the AnTuTu benchmark and is therefore approximately 56% faster than its predecessor, the Meizu M2 Note.
The M3 Note is available in three different colors (grey, silver and champagne gold) and comes with either 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage or 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage.
Unlike its predecessor, the Meizu M3 Note has a full-metal body, which measures 153.6 mm (6.05 in) x 75.5 mm (2.97 in) x 8.2 mm (0.32 in) and weighs 163 g (5.7 oz). It has a slate form factor, being rectangular with rounded corners and has only one central physical button at the front. Unlike most other Android smartphones, the M3 Note doesn't have capacitive buttons nor on-screen buttons.
