According to its founders, ShiftMobility is one of the first companies connecting aftermarket manufacturers, distributors, and repair shops with each other and clients on a single platform. ShopLite is ShiftMobility's mobile app that manages parts sources for independent repair centers by connecting part manufacturer's distributor inventory and price lists to repair centers allowing immediate response to car owner's service needs. The company combined industry research and input from automotive shop owners to design the fully integrated application.  ShopLite includes services such as license plate and VIN scan abilities, an OEM library with over 30 car manufacturers, and a searchable network of local OE and aftermarket distributors inventories.
