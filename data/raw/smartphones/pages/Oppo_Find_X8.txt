== Reception ==
Various tech reviews have criticized its Live Alerts feature in ColorOS 15. According to TechRadar, it seems they might've copied the idea from Apple's Dynamic Island. However, some reviewers praise it about its high price–performance ratio compared to top of the line smartphones like iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra. Many are still waiting for the Ultra model to be released globally.
