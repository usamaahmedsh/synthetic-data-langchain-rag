AndroidWorld praised the autonomy, camera and display of the Redmi 7, criticizing the lack of support for HD content from streaming services, the body, which gets dirty easily, and the fact that it is equipped with a port microUSB instead of USB-C.
The Redmi 7A, however, had the approval of TechRadar with regards to the battery, whose duration was defined as "exceptional", the presence of the integrated FM radio, without the need to insert earphones, something that has become rare in smartphones; he also defined the performance as decent considering the low price and the absence of NFC and the fingerprint reader as disappointing.
