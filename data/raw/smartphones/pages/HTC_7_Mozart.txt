The  HTC 7 Mozart  (also known as the HTC Mozart), is a mobile smartphone running the Windows Phone operating system. The phone was designed and manufactured by HTC.
The HTC 7 Mozart is one of three Windows Phone handsets available from HTC in the UK at launch, and has a focus on high-fidelity audio with Dolby Mobile and SRS surround sound built in. It is also the only Windows Phone product from HTC with a Qualcomm S2 Generation chipset. All others use the S1 generation (As of August 20, 2011).
Available exclusively on Orange from 21 October 2010 to 2011, the HTC 7 Mozart is very similar in size and styling to many other HTC handsets, save that it boasts the three standard buttons below the screen specified by Microsoft across all Windows Phone devices.

There was a lot of speculation whether HTC Mozart was to get the 7.8 Update. This was confirmed by HTC and the update was released on 14/03/2013. The most recent update is the Build 7.10.8862.144 live tile fix which can be downloaded via Zune.
Since 2012, people have reported they were able to upgrade to 7.8 RTM using a cab sender utility. This method of upgrading has proved successful to many people but it is only recommended for advanced users.
The 7.8 update gives the Mozart increased performance and battery life has an easy to spot improvement. The standard life on Windows Phone 7.5 was reported at around 5 hours of heavy usage. Windows Phone 7.8 however has increased battery life up to 10 hours on heavy usage.
