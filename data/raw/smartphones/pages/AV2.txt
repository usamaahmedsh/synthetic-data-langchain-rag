AV2 is an open, royalty-free video coding format being developed by the Alliance for Open Media, a non-profit technology development consortium. It is the successor to their existing and widely deployed AV1 encoding format, and is designed to deliver better compression performance, enhanced support for AR, VR and split-screen usage and support for a wider visual quality range. 
AV2 development work started in 2020, two years after the release of AV1. 
AV2 uses an overall encoding framework that is similar to that of AV1, but with significant innovations in every part of that framework. These include extended recursive partitioning, changes to transform block partitioning, semi-decoupled partitioning of luma and chroma, improvements to intra-frame prediction including chroma from luma, and new modes for inter-frame prediction.
The Alliance for Open Media has stated that AV2 will formally be released at the end of 2025, with hardware implementations expected in 2026.
AV2 will be competing with the royalty-based format VVC for adoption in the market, in a way similar to the competition between the earlier generation HEVC and AV1 formats. As of 2025, prototype AV2 implementations show considerable bitrate improvements over AV1, and AV2 is expected to offer similar performance to VVC overall.
