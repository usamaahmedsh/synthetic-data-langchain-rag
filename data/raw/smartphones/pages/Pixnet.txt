PIXNET was started in 2003 as an online photo hosting service for students, and over time evolved into a social network.
In 2007 it received financial backing from the Hong Kong–based TOM Group. This backing supported the site's hosting by Amazon Web Services in order for it to grow; AWS processes over 10 million pictures every day.
