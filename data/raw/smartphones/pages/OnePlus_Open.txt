The OnePlus Open is a foldable smartphone manufactured by OnePlus. The phone was co-developed with its parent company Oppo which markets the phone as the Oppo Find N3. The product was revealed on 19 October 2023.


== History ==
In early October 2023, OnePlus' co-founder and CEO Pete Lau confirmed that the OnePlus Open was designed by both OnePlus and Oppo, and that it would be released under both brands with different names. It was rumored that Oppo's name would be the Oppo Find N3.


== Hardware ==
The OnePlus Open has a 6.31-inch front screen. When it is folded out, the screen is 7.82 inches. It is 11.7 millimeters thick when folded. It has 120hz AMOLED screens on both the front and inside. It has 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of internal storage. It has a 4,805-mAh battery and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset. The phone has no wireless charging. The phone comes in 2 finishes depending on color the Black model has a leatherette back while the Emerald Dusk model has a glass back. On the back it has a triple camera setup, in partnership with Hasselblad. The main camera is a 48MP Sony LYT-T808 “Pixel Stacked” Sensor, 1/1.43” sensor, 1.12 μm, ƒ/1.7, AF. The telephoto is a 64MP OV64B Sensor with 3× Optical Zoom, 6× in-sensor zoom, 1/2” sensor, 0.7 μm, ƒ/2.6, AF. The ultrawide camera is a 48MP Sony IMX581 with 114° FOV, 1/2” sensor, ƒ/2.2, AF.


== Software Improvements ==
The OnePlus Open runs OxygenOS 13.2, which the company says it will support with four years of OS upgrades for the Open and five years of security updates. This iteration of OxygenOS comes with some thoughtful multitasking features to make use of the large inner screen. You can open two apps in a split view, as you’d expect, but you can also add a third app that sort of hovers on the side of the display so it’s partially visible and you can tab over to it quickly. App pairs and trios can be saved as home screen shortcuts, too.
There’s a taskbar that you can display and hide easily, and it includes recent apps as well as a folder of recent documents. There’s also support for floating windows, which you can position anywhere on the screen, resize to your taste, and minimize to a tab at the side of the screen so you can easily fetch them again.
By default, when you open an app on the inner display, it will expand to fill the whole screen. Opening a second app in split screen view doesn’t automatically resize the first app to display on half the screen, though. The first app kind of scoots over, and your view of it is cut off.
You can work around this in settings by dictating how each individual app should display on the main screen — in 16:9, 4:3, or full screen. Switching to 16:9 makes room for another app on the unoccupied portion of the screen without cutting off the first one.


== Pricing ==
The Oneplus Open starts at US$1,600. At launch, trade-in discounts of $200 or more are available, including a $200 trade-in discount on any smartphone of any condition.


== Issues ==
An early reviewer of the phone, Marques Brownlee, stated that while the phone was great in hardware, his display had dead pixels within barely a week of using the phone. OnePlus has not yet commented on this.
