=== Hardware and design ===
The Meizu U20 features a MediaTek Helio P10 system-on-a-chip with an array of eight ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores, an ARM Mali-T860 MP2 GPU and 2 or 3 GB of RAM.
The U20 is available in four different colors (white, black, champagne gold and rose gold) and comes with either 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage or with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage.
The Meizu U20 has a full-metal frame, while the front and the back are made out of glass. The U20 measures 153.0 mm (6.02 in) x 75.4 mm (2.97 in) x 7.7 mm (0.30 in) and weighs 158 g (5.6 oz). It has a slate form factor, being rectangular with rounded corners and has only one central physical button at the front. Unlike most other Android smartphones, the U10 doesn't have capacitive buttons nor on-screen buttons. The functionality of these keys is implemented using a technology called mBack, which makes use of gestures with the physical button. The U10 further extends this button by a fingerprint sensor called mTouch.
The U20 features a fully laminated 5.5-inch multi-touch capacitive touchscreen display with a HD resolution of 1080 by 1920 pixels. The pixel density of the display is 400 ppi.
In addition to the touchscreen input and the front key, the device has volume/zoom control buttons and the power/lock button on the right side, a 3.5mm TRS audio jack on the top and a microUSB (Micro-B type) port on the bottom for charging and connectivity.
The Meizu U20 has two cameras. The rear camera has a resolution of 13 MP, a ƒ/2.2 aperture, a 5-element lens, phase-detection autofocus and an LED flash. The front camera has a resolution of 5 MP, a ƒ/2.0 aperture and a 4-element lens.
