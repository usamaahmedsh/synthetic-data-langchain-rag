The Motorola Edge 50 series is a range of Android smartphones developed by Motorola Mobility, a subsidiary of Lenovo. Launched in 2024, the series comprises several models, including the Motorola Edge 50 (known in North America as the Motorola Edge (2024)), the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion (announced for global markets), the Motorola Edge 50 Pro, and the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra. The series was later expanded with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo in September 2024.


== Motorola Edge 50 ==
The Motorola Edge 50 (referred to in North America as the Motorola Edge (2024)) is the base model of the Edge 50 series for certain markets. It was introduced in May 2024 with a design that emphasizes key mid-range features.


=== Design, display and hardware ===
The Motorola Edge 50 was announced on May 8, 2024. It measures 159.6 x 71.9 x 8.1 mm and weighs 174 grams. The device has a glass front (Gorilla Glass 3), a plastic frame, and a silicone polymer back with an eco leather finish. It is rated IP68 for dust and water resistance.
The 6.6‑inch curved P-OLED display supports 1 billion colors, a 144 Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ and a peak brightness of 1300 nits. The resolution is 1080 x 2400 pixels (approximately 405 ppi), and the screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3.
Powered by the Qualcomm SM7550-AB Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4 nm) chipset with an octa‑core CPU and Adreno 710 GPU, the device comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 2.2 internal storage (no expandable slot). It runs Android 14.
The rear camera system includes a 50MP main sensor (Sony LYT-700C, f/1.8) with PDAF and OIS, and a 13MP ultrawide lens (f/2.2, 120˚) with AF for macro photography. The front camera is a 32MP sensor (f/2.4). Video recording is supported at up to 4K@30fps on the rear camera and 1080p@30fps on the front.
Stereo speakers and a 5000mAh non-removable battery are included, with support for 68W wired charging (advertised as 50% in 15 min) and 15W wireless charging.


=== Availability and pricing ===
The Motorola Edge 50 was released in the US market in May 2024 at a retail price of $549.99. It was made available through Motorola's website and other retailers and is offered in Midnight Blue with a vegan leather finish.


=== Reception ===
Reviews noted the design—including the vegan leather back and 144 Hz display—as well as the fast charging and IP68 rating. Some reviewers mentioned that while the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 offers satisfactory everyday performance, it may not be optimal for heavy gaming compared to other chips. Camera performance was considered adequate for its class, and the use of Gorilla Glass 3 was seen as a conservative choice compared to some newer glass standards.


== Motorola Edge 50 Fusion ==
The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is targeted at the global market and was announced in April 2024. It shares design characteristics with other models in the series while accommodating regional hardware variations.


=== Design, display and hardware ===
Announced on April 16, 2024, the Edge 50 Fusion measures 161.9 x 73.1 x 7.9 mm and weighs 175 grams. Its construction comprises a glass front (typically Gorilla Glass 5 in global versions), a plastic frame, and either a silicone polymer back (eco leather) or a PMMA back. The device is rated IP68 for dust and water resistance.
The Fusion features a 6.7‑inch P-OLED display supporting 1 billion colors, a 144 Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1600 nits. The screen resolution is 1080 x 2400 pixels (approximately 393 ppi) and is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5.
Chipset configurations vary by region: international models typically use the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4 nm), while some models for Latin America, India, and Oceania are built on the Qualcomm SM6450 Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 (4 nm). The device is available with configurations of up to 512GB storage and 12GB RAM (UFS 2.2) and runs Android 14.
The rear camera setup includes a 50MP main sensor (Sony LYTIA 700C) with OIS and a 13MP ultrawide lens with AF. The front camera is a 32MP sensor. Both cameras support 4K video recording (rear at 30fps, front at 30fps).

=== Reception ===
Critics characterized the Edge 50 Fusion as a mid-range smartphone with a well‑balanced display and design. Its 144 Hz P‑OLED display, Pantone‑curated color options, and IP68 rating were noted as positive features.
