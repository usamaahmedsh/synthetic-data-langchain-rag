In reviews, the general feedback was favorable, with critics praising the more accessible elements of it over the original Mi Mix such as worldwide LTE bands, a lower price than the original Mi Mix, a smaller display and a traditional earpiece speaker to replace the piezoelectric speaker in the original Mi Mix. Users are reporting 4G connection issues in France on Orange and Bouygues Networks. Also, the phone does not support 4G+ Carrier Aggregation Intern and (B3+ B7) which is widely used in Europe.
