==== Processors ====
The Mate 60 is the first Huawei smartphone to feature a 7 nm SoC designed and manufactured in mainland China, despite the imposition of US sanctions on the company. 
The HiSilicon Kirin 9000S CPU is a SoC supposed to consist of four high-performance cores (one at up to 2.62 GHz and three at up to 2,150 MHz) that is based on HiSilicon's custom TaiShan microarchitecture and four energy-efficient cores (up to 1,530 MHz) based on ARM's Cortex 510. The Mate 60 also uses the Maleoon 910 graphics processing unit operating at up to 750 MHz.


==== Network communications ====
According to third-party testing, after inserting the SIM card, the Mate 60 does not show a 5G connection and Huawei does not mention supporting 5G in the parameter details; the actual network speed test shows that its performance is 5G. Reports also believe that it has the ability to support 5G.
Huawei focuses more on promoting its satellite capabilities.  The Mate 60 supports satellite call functions through the Tiantong system and short message sending and receiving functions through the Beidou system.
The Mate 60 also supports NearLink, a short-range wireless communication technology that combines the features of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi with enhanced prerequisites and can be used in the future with Internet of Things and Internet of Vehicles.


==== Camera ====
At the end of 2023, the Mate 60 Pro+ had the best smartphone camera in the world, according to DxOMark.

==== Operating system ====
The Mate 60 was launched with the operating system HarmonyOS 4. In the second quarter of 2025, an update from HarmonyOS 4 to the operating system HarmonyOS NEXT 5.0.1, which does not support Android apps, was to become available.


== Reception ==
The launch of the Mate 60 garnered significant attention and was widely touted as a victory against US government sanctions intended to stop Chinese companies from producing or obtaining advanced chips. Huawei's breakthrough raised concerns within the US government that technological restrictions alone were unable to prevent Huawei from obtaining advanced chips: the U.S. Department of Commerce launched an investigation into the situation at the end of 2023.
On March 5, 2024, a report by Counterpoint Research claimed that although overall Chinese smartphone sales were 7% lower in the first six weeks of 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, Apple’s recently launched flagship iPhone 15 was selling exceptionally badly, with Apple’s overall smartphone unit sales falling 24% in the relevant period, because buyers were turning towards devices made by Huawei. According to Counterpoint Research, Huawei saw unit sales rise by 64% in the period.


== Impact in China ==
Huawei had told their customers that stores in Shenzhen would only have a certain amount of phones to sell, which resulted in long lines outside every store. On August 30, 2023, Huawei Mall launched the Mate 60 pre-order page. On September 3 of that same year, the Mate 60 Pro was fully on-sale. At 18:08, online platforms such as Huawei Mall, Taobao, Tmall, and JD.com sold out all available colors in just one minute after opening sales to the public. There were also lines of people waiting to buy at Huawei stores across China. On September 8, Huawei Mall launched the Mate 60 Pro+ pre-order page.
