In 2002, Siemens Mobile Acceleration (today's smac|partners GmbH) invested into SVOX.

In parallel, SVOX has branched into Speech Recognition and Speech Dialog. As part of that process, the company acquired Professional Speech Processing Group of Siemens AG in early 2009.
In 2009, SVOX made headlines with news that Google had chosen to include the company's Pico TTS solution into the 1.6 release of Android platform.
In June 2011, Nuance Communications acquired SVOX.
