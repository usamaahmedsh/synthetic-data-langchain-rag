== Reviews ==
The Deccan Chronicle stated, "When Lenovo asked its bunch of product development experts in Japan, China and the US, to create a flagship smartphone of its VIBE series, they were given a free hand without having to bother about a production budget. The product team  delivered a monster of a phone, and it seems many in the team are professional photographers, or are at least interested in something more than selfies with multiple background options."
