== Specifications ==
Fairphone 5 is a modular smartphone, making it easily repairable and customisable by the user. It supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, and has a 4,200 mAh user replaceable battery. The phone is sold in configurations with 128 GB of storage and 6 GB RAM, and 256 GB of storage and 8 GB RAM. It has three 50 MP cameras with optical image stabilization, an IP55 rating, and a 90 Hz refresh rate.
The phone ships with Android 13, though users can switch to other operating systems. It is reported that it will receive five major Android updates and eight years of security patches. This is possible because the system-on-chip it uses is intended for industrial internet of things applications and will have a longer support life than a SoC intended for consumer devices.
