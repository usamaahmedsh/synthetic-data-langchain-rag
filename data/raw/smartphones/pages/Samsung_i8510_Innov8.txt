The Samsung GT-i8510 (marketed as the Samsung INNOV8, pronounced Innovate) is a Symbian OS mobile phone produced by Samsung Electronics, announced on 30 July 2008 and released in late 2008. The Innov8's functions include those of a camera phone and portable media player, including an 8-megapixel camera (which its name refers to) with Dual LED and Schneider-Kreuznach optics.
In addition to offering e-mail, web browsing, local Wi-Fi connectivity and text messaging, the Innov8 uses the S60 3rd Edition platform with Feature Pack 2, much like e.g. Nokia N85. The phone is available with either 8 GB or 16 GB internal memory and both feature a MicroSDHC memory card slot with support for cards up to 32 GB.
The Samsung Innov8 was critically acclaimed and is often considered one of the best Symbian devices of its time.
