The Nokia 1 is a Nokia-branded budget Android Go smartphone, developed by HMD Global. It was launched at the Mobile World Congress 2018, in Barcelona, Spain on 25 February 2018. This device, along with the Nokia 8 Sirocco, completes the lineup of Nokia-branded Android devices. The phone also has separately sold removable back covers marketed as Xpress-on, a trade-name that first appeared on the Nokia 5110. This was the first time the Xpress-on name was used since the Nokia Lumia 710 in 2012.
