The Pyongyang Touch (Korean: 평양 타치) is a line of smartphone, with its first version launched in North Korea in 2014 and likely produced by the Chinese company Uniscope. It is named after the capital of the country, Pyongyang. Not much is known about the technical data, but the phone is believed to run a modified version of Android. Externally, it resembles the iPhone 3G and is available in white, pink, and blue. Since access to the Internet is denied to a large part of the population in North Korea, there is only access to the Intranet Kwangmyong. It is particularly popular among the younger population, according to Choson Sinbo.
