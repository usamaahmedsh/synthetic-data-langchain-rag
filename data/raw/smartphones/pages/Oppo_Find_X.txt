According to Oppo, Find X will be its first phone to have global LTE compatibility which is crucial for the company to enter the European and North American market, the phone supports no fingerprint scanner to unlock the device and instead relies on facial recognition known as O-Face, which is done by the pop up taking as little as 0.5 s to pop up and unlock the phone.
