The HTC U11 has 4 microphones for 24-bit 360-degree audio recording. It also has HTC BoomSound Hi-Fi edition stereo speakers where the headphone acts as the tweeter while the bottom firing speaker acts as the woofer. Dust and water resistance are included with an IP67 certification.

On 15 June 2017, Chang Chia-lin, the president of HTC's smartphone and connected device division, stated that the HTC U11 had been selling better than its predecessors, the HTC One M9 and the HTC 10.


== HTC U11+ ==

HTC unveiled an upgraded version of the U11, the U11+, on November 2, 2017. It features a 6-inch 2:1 display (marketed as 18:9) with thinner bezels, a larger battery, a rear-mounted fingerprint reader, IP68 certification for dust and water resistance, and is pre-loaded with Android 8.0 Oreo. The Verge reported via internal sources that the U11+ had previously been developed as a successor to the original Pixel XL smartphone HTC had developed with Google, under the codename "Muskie", but that it had been shelved in favor of a version produced by LG instead, and was re-engineered into an update to the U11.


== HTC U11 Life ==
The U11 Life is a T-Mobile exclusive smartphone that was unveiled by HTC along with the U11+ on the same day. It features a 5.2-inch display, IP67 certification for water and dust resistance, a 73 hour long battery life, and is also shipped with Android 8.0 Oreo. Unlike the U11+, the U11 Life has a smaller display and comes shipped with the 4th Generation Android One platform, which it joined on September 13, 2017.
It is based on SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 with 3 or 4 GB RAM.
