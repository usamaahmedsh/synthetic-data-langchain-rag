Armando Rodriguez from PC World wrote: "The Nokia Lumia 928 is excellent for capturing images in low-light environments, but the phone falls victim to Windows Phone's various shortcomings."
Alex Colon from PCMag wrote: "For $100, the Nokia Lumia 928 is a lot of phone, both literal and figurative. I do wish it were smaller still, like the just-announced Lumia 925, but you're getting plenty of bang for your buck here. The biggest question is how much you care about apps. The Lumia 928 is competitive in many ways with some of the best smartphones available, but it just can't keep up when it comes to apps."
