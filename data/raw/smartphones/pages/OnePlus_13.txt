==== Battery ====
OnePlus 13 uses a 6,000 mAh silicon carbon battery, which has a higher energy density compared to the typical graphite-based lithium-ion batteries found in most smartphones. Being OnePlus' first smartphone to employ this new technology, it allowed the OnePlus 13 to have a higher battery capacity while being thinner than the OnePlus 12, and has the highest battery capacity of all their smartphones to date.
Notebookcheck reported that the OnePlus 13 has a higher battery runtime than OnePlus 12 in all 3 tests—2267 minutes vs 1965 minutes in Reader/Idle test, 2321 minutes vs 1820 minutes in H.264 video playback test, and 1349 minutes vs 1237 minutes in Wi-Fi websurfing test.
OnePlus 13 supports 50W wireless charging using the OnePlus AirVOOC charger and the AirVOOC magnetic charger with a magnetic case. A full charge in both cases is estimated to take 75 minutes.
