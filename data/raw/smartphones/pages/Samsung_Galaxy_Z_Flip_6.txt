== Design ==
Compared to its predecessor, the Galaxy Z Flip 5, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 features a more squared-off frame design. The wide camera has been upgraded to 50 MP, and the camera rings are color-matched to the device’s body. The cover screen now supports resizable widgets, allowing multiple widgets to be displayed on a single page.  Internally, a cooling system has been added to improve thermal management capabilities. The cover screen and back panel are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, while the inner display uses ultra-thin glass (UTG). The device holds an IP48 rating, making it the first foldable smartphone with certified dust protection. The frame is constructed from matte aluminum, compared to the polished frame on the Z Flip 5. The device's clamshell design also enables Flex Mode, which supports split-screen interactions when partially folded.


=== Colors ===
The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is available in seven colors: Blue, Silver Shadow, Mint, Yellow, Crafted Black, White, and Peach. Crafted Black, White, and Peach are online-exclusive variants, with Crafted black featuring a carbon fiber pattern finish.


== Key features ==


=== Flex Mode ===
Flex Mode enables the device to stay partially folded at various stable angles, typically between 75 and 115 degrees. When activated, supported apps automatically adjust their interface—often displaying content on the upper half and controls or additional features on the lower half of the screen. This configuration allows users to interact with media or multitask without fully unfolding the device.


=== Flex Cam ===
Flex Cam builds on Flex Mode by enhancing camera functionality for hands-free use. When the device is partially folded and positioned at a stable angle—such as on a table or shelf—users can take selfies, group shots, or record videos without manually holding the phone. Example use cases include static camera setups for video recording or remote communication. Additional features include automatic framing to maintain subject alignment, voice-activated capture for touch-free operation, and live camera previews via the cover display.


=== Cover screen features ===
The Galaxy Z Flip 6 features a 3.4-inch cover display that supports interactive widgets, quick reply options, and selfie previews utilizing the rear camera. Multiple widgets can now be displayed simultaneously on a single page, allowing access to functions without requiring the device to be unfolded.
