The triple-lens camera can create a bokeh effect through the 3D depth sensor. There is a 32 MP f/2.0 selfie camera. The camera also has Samsung's scene optimizer technology that recognizes 20 different scenes and automatically adjusts the camera. The phone also can record 4K and super-slow motion video through the camera application.


=== Software ===
The Samsung Galaxy A70 series runs on Android Pie with Samsung's One UI skin that repositions the touch area in stock Samsung apps towards the bottom, making the interface easier for one-handed use with a large screen. Features include Bixby, Google Assistant, Samsung Health, and Samsung Pay, although the Bixby button is not included.
 On December 2, 2020, Samsung released a list of numerous Galaxy devices that would be eligible for the One UI 3-Android 11 upgrade, of which the A70 was included. The A70 received the update around May 2021 (although this usually depends on country), which would be the last major Android upgrade for the Galaxy A70.


== Galaxy A70s ==
On September 27, 2019, an improved version of the A70, the A70s, was released in India. The phone has the same specs as the A70, except for improvements in the camera and changed design. The 32 MP f/1.7 main camera has been changed to a 64 MP f/1.8 main camera that can bind four pixels into one, creating a 16 MP image that improves low-light performance. The phone also features super steady video like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and a night mode. The design of the phone has been changed into a “3D Prism” design with a glossy back.
