=== Memory and storage ===
The Galaxy S24 phones feature 4,800 MT/s LPDDR5X memory and Universal Flash Storage 3.1 with 128 GB or version 4.0 with 256 GB and above.


=== Software ===
The Galaxy S24 phones come with the Android 14 operating system with One UI 6.1 pre-installed, which was the latest version of Android available at the time of its release.
The Galaxy S24 series are the first Samsung devices alongside the Galaxy Z6 series, Galaxy Tab S10 and Galaxy Tab A11 series in which it will get up to 7 years of OS and security updates, making Samsung the second manufacturer to offer 7 years of support (the first to do so was Google with the release of the Pixel 8 lineup). This would mean software updates would end within 2031.
Starting with the Galaxy S24, 32-bit ARMv7 applications are no longer supported due to restrictions in the SoC. Other Galaxy devices (except watches) from 2024 onwards will also not support 32-bit ARMv7 apps.


==== AI On-device Model ====
This version of One UI, alongside newer versions of the user interface, mainly includes new AI-based features that are marketed as "Galaxy AI" and rely on a combination of local models and cloud-based models. In mainland China, the cloud partner is Baidu providing its Ernie model, while in international markets (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), the cloud partner is Google providing its Gemini Pro model.
All phones use Google's on-device Gemini Nano, already used by their own Pixel 8 Pro and their Pixel 9 series.


==== Update history ====


== Reception ==


=== S Pen burnt smell ===
Some users noted the unpleasant smell of the Galaxy S24 Ultra's S Pen, likened to "burnt plastic". A moderator on Samsung's EU forums said the smell was a normal part of the pen's operation, and "isn't anything to be concerned about".
This smell is likely from chemical reactions to the plastic shell of the S Pen, induced by the internal heat of the phone.
