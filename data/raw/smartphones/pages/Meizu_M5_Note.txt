GSM Arena concluded that whilst featuring an attractive design, Meizu M5 Note was described as being less impressive than competitor devices, noting "everything about the phone is average, while the competition goes above and beyond the understanding of the term average." Android Headlines also commented on the issue of LTE support, saying it should be carefully considered "If you live in a country where the Meizu M5 Note supports all of the bands that you need for LTE, then definitely."
Phandroid commented that storage could be an issue saying, "just as long as you opt for the 32GB models so you can install more than a few dozen apps before running out of storage."
