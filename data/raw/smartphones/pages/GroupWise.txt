GroupWise is a messaging and collaboration platform from OpenText that supports email, calendaring, personal information management, instant messaging, and document management.  The GroupWise platform consists of desktop client software, which is available for Windows, (formerly Mac OS X, and Linux), and the server software, which is supported on Windows Server and Linux.
The platform also supports WebAccess, its browser-based webmail client.  Mobile access to messaging, calendaring, contacts and other data from smartphones and tablet computers is supported (through the GroupWise Mobility Service software) via the Exchange ActiveSync protocol.  Enterprise instant messaging and presence is handled by GroupWise Messenger, which integrates with GroupWise.
The product's ownership history includes WordPerfect, Novell and Attachmate; Micro Focus's 2014 acquisition of Attachmate resulted in the product's Micro Focus GroupWise name. Micro Focus was acquired by OpenText and the product name was changed to OpenText GroupWise.
The latest generation of the platform is GroupWise 24.4.


== Summary ==
GroupWise operates on a number of server and workstation platforms, including Linux and Windows for the server software (support for NetWare was discontinued in GroupWise 2012).  Client software is supported on Windows. A Java client was previously available for macOS and Linux but is now discontinued and no longer supported.  GroupWise connectors also exists for Microsoft Outlook (although it is no longer supported) and for Evolution.
GroupWise WebAccess provides users with most of the functionality of the desktop clients from a web browser.  WebAccess also supports mobile web access via a user interface tailored specifically for mobile operating systems.  GroupWise Mobility Service which was powered by technology from Nokia, was previously used to synchronize mail and other data to mobile devices.  A new mobile gateway, Novell Data Synchronizer Mobility Pack, was released with Exchange ActiveSync support in late 2010 to support iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry 10.
The GroupWise Post Office Agent supports IMAP and SOAP access to user mailboxes, in addition to the native client.  The GroupWise Internet Agent provides SMTP communication to other email systems, and also supports IMAP, POP3, SOAP, and iCalendar access to user mailboxes and data.
The platform has included instant messaging since the GroupWise 6.5 release, specifically targeted at the corporate market with features such as directory integration and encryption. In addition to the Windows, Linux, and Mac clients provided by Novell, the protocol is supported by Gossip, iChat, and multiprotocol applications such as Kopete, Pidgin, and Adium. There is also a client available for BlackBerry.
GroupWise can export Novell Address Book data.
As of 2024, the latest version of GroupWise is GroupWise 24.4. Licensing for GroupWise includes access to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, which can be used for running the GroupWise server at no additional cost.  OpenText Open Workgroup Suite includes GroupWise.
