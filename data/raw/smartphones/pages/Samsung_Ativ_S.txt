The Samsung ATIV S is a touchscreen, slate smartphone manufactured by Samsung Electronics running the Windows Phone 8 operating system, upgradeable to Windows Phone 8.1. The ATIV S was Samsung's first Windows Phone 8 device, and one of the first devices under its ATIV series of Microsoft Windows-based products. It was shown at the IFA 2012 in Berlin and was the first Windows Phone 8 device to be officially unveiled, ahead of the Nokia Lumia 920.
There were three variants of the ATIV S. All feature a 4.8-inch 1280x720 HD Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 306ppi, a 1.5 GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB of RAM, an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, near field communications, and support for HSPA+ networks. Specific variants include:

GT-I8750 - the globalized version of the ATIV S, with a 1.9MP front-facing camera
GT-I8370 - a version specific to the UK, Canada and Singapore but with a 1.2MP front camera instead of 1.9MP
SGH-T899M - sold in Canada, equipped with 700 MHz LTE and Bluetooth 2.1 (downgraded from 3.0)
The ATIV S was available with 16 or 32 GB of internal storage with micro SDXC expansion for up to an additional 128 GB or more. It further featured a 2300mAh removable battery and a brushed-metal look of the battery door. Overall, the hardware was very similar to the Android-based Galaxy S III.
A variant of the Samsung ATIV S, called the Samsung ATIV S Neo, was announced by Sprint on 26 June 2013 for a summer 2013 release, alongside the HTC 8XT. This phone's appearance is similar to the ATIV S, though has notable differences spec-wise, having 1.4 GHz processor speed, a 2000mAh battery, TFT LCD screen, and LTE connectivity.
