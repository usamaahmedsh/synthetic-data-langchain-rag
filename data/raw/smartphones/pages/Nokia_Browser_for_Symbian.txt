Nokia Browser for Symbian (formerly known as Web Browser for S60) was the default web browser for the S60 and Symbian mobile phone platform. The browser is based on a port of Apple Inc.'s open-source WebCore and JavaScriptCore frameworks which form the WebKit rendering engine that Apple uses in its Safari Web browser.


== History ==
The first version in 2002 was lacking support for the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and Wireless Markup Language (WML) and Adobe Flash Lite. s60 version 2 introduced support for WAP and WML. Hence the Nokia Services (WAP) browser was the default browser on initial device shipments of this platform.
Nokia announced porting WebKit to the S60 Browser in June 2005, and made it available in November. At the 2006 World Wide Web Conference, Nokia announced that it was releasing the source code for its port of WebKit back to the community.


=== Browser ===
It supports:

HTML
WAP 2.0 (XHTML)
Cookies and JavaScript
Wide web pages can be formatted for mobile viewing
Multi-file download
Super web browsing
Drawbacks:

Multi-window browsing is not supported.
It does not compress pages, which puts a greater strain on the phone's processor and bandwidth usage.


=== S60v3 Browser (1 April 2006) ===
It supports:

HTML
WAP 2.0 (XHTML)
Cookies and Adobe Flash Lite
Multi-window browsing
Many files (up to 10) can be downloaded at once. This s60 v3 was the first version to support Adobe Flash Lite.


=== Nokia Browser 7.0 ===
Nokia Browser 7.0 is supported on S60 5th Edition devices.
This version supports all of the features of prior to the Nokia Browser 7 releases, as well as the following additional features:

Support for touch devices
On-screen zoom controls


=== Nokia Browser 7.1 ===
Nokia Browser 7.1 is supported on S60 3rd and 5th Edition devices.
New features:

Based on WebKit 525
Full support for Flash Lite 3.0
Supports kinetic scrolling
User-configurable shortcut keys and visual keymap
Full-screen view
Drawbacks:

Copy paste support is poor. If you have a device with no Control-key or Pen-key, you can not copy paste in most web forms. With older Nokia models, like N95 or E90, this was not a problem, as N95 had a Pen-key and E90 had a Control-key. New N86 and N97 do not have such keys. However, E72, which was released in 11/2009, has a Control-key.
Some jQuery effects are not supported (fadeIn and slideDown)
