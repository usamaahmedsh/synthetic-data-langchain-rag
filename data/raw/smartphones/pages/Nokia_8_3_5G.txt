The Nokia 8.3 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G system-on-chip (SoC). Depending on model, it has either 6 or 8 GB of RAM, and 64 or 128 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card, up to 512 GB. In the dual-SIM model, there is space for two nano-SIMs and a microSD card.
The phone weighs 220 g and is 9 mm thick, which is comparable with the Nokia Lumia 1320 and the Lumia 1520, introduced in 2013. It has a 6.81" FHD+ IPS LCD screen with  'PureDisplay' technology, a 24 MP punch hole camera and a chin at the bottom with the Nokia logo.
The Nokia 8.3 5G has a quad-camera system with ZEISS optics, consisting of a 64 MP rear camera, a 12 MP ultra-wide camera, a 2 MP macro camera, and a 2 MP depth camera. The 8.3 5G is the second Nokia Android smartphone to be advertised with a 'PureView' camera, after the Nokia 9 PureView.


== Nokia 8V 5G UW ==
In March 2020, Nokia released a Verizon carrier-locked version of this phone called the Nokia 8V 5G UW. It is identical to the Nokia 8.3 except that it is Verizon locked and is not an Android One smartphone. It also is locked to Android 10 and cannot receive updates. Following the expiration of the contract and release of unlocked Verizon-compatible Nokia phones, the price has been significantly reduced.
