The Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra is an Android-based high-end smartphone developed by Xiaomi Inc. announced on 11 August 2020 as a celebration of Xiaomi's 10th anniversary. Unlike the Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro, Mi 10 Ultra is only available on the Chinese market.


== Specifications ==


=== Design ===
The Mi 10 Ultra uses an aluminum frame, Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and Gorilla Glass 6 on the back. The display is curved and larger than the Mi 9 Pro; a circular cutout in the upper left hand corner for the front-facing camera replaces the Mi 9 Pro's notch. The camera module is rectangular and protrudes slightly, with a lower module housing three sensors and the flash, and an upper module for the periscope telephoto sensor with a silver accent. It is available in Obsidian Black, Mercury Silver, and a special Transparent Edition.


=== Hardware ===
The Mi 10 Ultra is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, with the Adreno 650 GPU. Storage is non-expandable with 128, 256 or 512 GB of UFS 3.1 paired with 8, 12 or 16 GB of LPDDR5 RAM.
It has an 6.67-inch (169 mm) FHD+ OLED display manufactured by TCL with HDR10+ support, and an optical (in-screen) fingerprint scanner. However, the panel has a higher 120 Hz refresh rate compared to 90 Hz on the Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro, and can display one billion colors. The battery is graphene-based lithium-ion with a 4500mAh capacity; charging is supported wired over USB-C at up to 120 W or wirelessly at up to 50 W (Qi), with 10 W reverse charging.
The rear features a quad camera setup, with a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP 5x zoom "periscope" telephoto sensor, a 12 MP 2x zoom telephoto sensor, and a 20 MP ultrawide sensor. The front-facing camera uses a 20 MP sensor. The camera system, including processing, scored the highest results in the history of DxOMark testing and review, for both still photography and videography.


=== Software ===
The Mi 10 Ultra runs on Android 10, with Xiaomi's custom MIUI 12 skin.
In 2024, the device was upgraded to Xiaomi HyperOS based on Android 14.
