ROG Phone 5 is a line of Android gaming smartphones made by Asus as the fourth generation of ROG smartphone series following the third generation ROG Phone 3 (and skipping the number four as the number four is considered unlucky in many East Asian cultures). It was launched on 10 March 2021.


== Models ==
The lineup includes three models— the ROG Phone 5 is the base model which costs €799. The ROG Phone 5 Pro is a slightly higher-end model with similar specifications, and the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is their highest-end and most expensive model at €1299.


== ROG Phone 5s ==
Asus announced the ROG Phone 5s and 5s Pro in August 2021 as hardware revisions. Both phones have the Snapdragon 888+ chipset, as well as a faster touch sampling rate of 360 Hz compared to 300 Hz on the ROG Phone 5.
