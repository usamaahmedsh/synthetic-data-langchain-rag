== Reception ==
The HTC One (E8) received generally positive reviews. The consensus among critics was that while it has similar performance and user interface as the M8, the E8 lacks any stand-out features from other 2014 Android flagships, most notably the rear camera. Aloysius Low of CNET gave the E8 a 7.3 out of 10. Good points noted in the review were that the phone included top-end hardware, a bright and vibrant display, and most of the features of the M8, and bad points were that the phone lacked the dual-camera system of the M8, and did not have any notable features compared to its competitors. Gareth Beavis of TechRadar gave the E8 a 4 out of 5, saying that the components were powerful and the user interface was impressive, but noted that the phone was slippery, the camera was too generic, and the phone was too light compared to the M8. Chris P. of PhoneArena gave the E8 an 8.7 out of 10, praising the "attractive" design, bright screen, the interface, and front-facing speakers, and criticizing the glossy finish of color versions, mediocre camera, call quality, and "blueish" screen.
