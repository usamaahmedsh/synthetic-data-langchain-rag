=== Hardware ===
The Honor 20 has a HiSilicon Kirin 980 octa-core processor, a Mali-G76 MP10 GPU, and a 3,750 mAh non-removable battery. It has a 6.26-inch “all-view” display LCD screen.
The phone has four rear cameras including a 48-megapixel main camera, a 16-megapixel super-wide-angle camera, a 2-megapixel depth camera and a 2-megapixel macro camera.

The HONOR 20 shares many core similarities with the Pro version – using the same SoC, for example – but with less onboard RAM at 6GB and only 128GB of native storage. Another difference is that the rear quad camera's 8-megapixel telephoto unit has been exchanged with a 2-megapixel depth assisting unit. The device features the same display and front camera as the Pro version, but the battery capacity is slightly less at 3,750mAh, though it uses the same charger as the Pro version.
The HONOR 20 comes in Phantom Blue or Phantom Black for the global market, Icelandic White for the China market, and is priced at €499.


=== Software ===
The Honor 20 launched with Android Pie (version 9.0) and EMUI 9.0.
