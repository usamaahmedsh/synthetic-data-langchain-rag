== History ==


=== Early history ===
Compunetics, Inc. was founded in 1968 by Dr. Giorgio Coraluppi. Initially operating as a contract engineering firm, the company entered the printed circuit board market in 1969. For the next few decades, Compunetics worked to create custom technologies for several agencies of the United States Government.
In the 1980s, Compunetics received its first U.S. patent for a "Rearrangeable full Availability Multistage Switching Network with Redundant Conductors".  Utilizing this technology, Compunetics was able to secure a contract for NASA that entailed creating a voice control system (VSS and VSD units) that could connect up to 4,000 mission specialists around the world.  Shortly thereafter, Compunetics developed the CONTEX 240 and 480 conference bridges, which were regarded as groundbreaking conferencing platforms.
