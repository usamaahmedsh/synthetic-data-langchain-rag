The Xiaomi Redmi 1S, code-named armani HM 1S, is a smartphone released in May 2014, developed by the Chinese company Xiaomi Inc. It is a part of the Redmi series of smartphones, and succeeded the Redmi 1. Visually similar to its predecessor, it comes with a 4.7-inch screen, a quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A7 processor and runs Android version 4.3 (Jellybean), bundled with the proprietary MIUI v5 user interface, which can be upgraded to MIUI v9 based on Android 4.4.4 KTU84P.
Noted for its low price (₹5,999 (US$71) in India), the Redmi 1S was an extremely popular and a demanded smartphone. Xiaomi opted to sell the smartphone online in order to comply with their minimal capital input. Flipkart was the exclusive retailer of Redmi 1S in India. The company discontinued the smartphone's sale in India in favor of the successors Redmi 2 and Redmi Note.
