Fira OS is a Linux-based mobile operating system and software platform developed by Fira, a subsidiary of Indonesian electronic giant Polytron (member of Djarum Group). Introduced on January 28, 2016, it was forked from Android and installed on newer Polytron smartphones since 2016.


== Overview ==
Fira OS is based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the Linux kernel. It was built to comply with an Indonesian regulation requiring 40% minimum local content on all 4G LTE smartphones sold in Indonesia starting in 2017.


== Applications ==
Fira OS features applications that are not usually available in other AOSP-based operating systems, such as FIRA Check Pulsa, FIRA Store, FIRA Pay, FIRA Directory, and others.
