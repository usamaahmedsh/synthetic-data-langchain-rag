== Reception ==
Critical reception to the device was mixed when it was initially released. Sharif Sakr of Engadget called the form factor of the device "neat" and the Snapdragon processor "aging", and said that the device has "decent-looking build quality and styling". Bogdan Bele of Android Authority noted that the device was intended for "more budget-conscious" customers that are "willing to make some serious compromises in terms of features". Andy Boxall of Digital Trends commented that the device looks "sleek and stylish" in its official pictures. Kate Solomon of TechRadar described the device as "diminuitive [sic] size with ageing specs".
PhoneArena gave the device a score of 6.5 out of 10. The review noted that the small size of the device meant that it was easy to hold, and the volume and power buttons were easy to press with tactile feedback. The 3.5 inch display was criticized for its low size and resolution, causing the web browsing to be "rather uninspiring", and the Sense 4.0 user interface "doesn't look all that pretty" at the screen resolution. Performance was relatively slow due to the entry level processor and 512 MB of RAM, and only 1 GB of the 4 GB of internal storage was accessible for the user. The 5 MP camera was fixed focus but very fast for capturing both photos and videos, and pictures were usually underexposed and noisy in auto shooting mode.
This phone wasn't being fared well in Western Europe, mainly due to lack of NFC of which the Desire C had.
