Device tracking software is a type of software that allows a user to monitor the real-time or historical location of an electronic device, and by extension, the person or item carrying it. The system typically consists of two main parts: a client-side application or agent installed on the device to be tracked, and a server-side platform that receives, processes, and displays the location data to the user.
The software on the device obtains its location using various technologies, including GPS, Wi-Fi positioning, or cellular network triangulation, and transmits this location data to the server. This technology is the foundation for a wide range of applications, from consumer services for finding lost or stolen devices to enterprise platforms for fleet management and employee monitoring. The overall solution is a type of tracking system that is integral to modern telematics.
Key features often include:

Real-time location tracking
Remote locking and wiping
Geofencing alerts
Usage monitoring
Common uses:

Finding lost or stolen devices
Parental controls
Fleet management for businesses
Employee monitoring
Some popular options:

Find My (Apple devices)
Google Find My Device (Android)
Prey (cross-platform)
Absolute (enterprise-focused)
Device tracking becomes significantly more challenging, and often nearly impossible, when the device's data connection is turned off.
This is because;

No GPS transmission: Without a data connection, the device can't send its GPS coordinates to tracking servers.
Cell tower triangulation fails: The device can't communicate with cell towers, preventing network-based location.
Wi-Fi positioning disabled: Without data, the device can't transmit information about nearby Wi-Fi networks.
IP tracking ineffective: No internet connection means no IP address to trace.
Background services halted: Tracking apps can't run or update in the background without data.
Remote commands blocked: Users can't send remote lock or wipe commands to a device without data.
In these cases, the last known location before data was turned off becomes crucial. Some tracking methods might still work if the device reconnects briefly, but continuous real-time tracking is essentially impossible without an active data connection.
