Zinwa Q25 (also marketed as Q25 Pro) is an Android smartphone developed by the Chinese company Zinwa Technologies in 2025. The device is a modified version of the BlackBerry Classic (2014), replacing its internals with newer components. Intended both as a completed handset and as a conversion kit for existing BlackBerry Classic devices, the Q25 retains the original BlackBerry's 3.5-inch 720×720 touchscreen, QWERTY keyboard, trackpad and LED notification light but adds a 4G-capable MediaTek Helio G99 system on chip, 12 GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage, a 50 MP rear camera, NFC and USB-C, and runs on Android 14. The project reflects a broader trend of retrofitting older mobile devices as a way to reduce electronic waste and to satisfy enthusiasts who prefer physical keyboards.


== Development and concept ==
Zinwa Technologies was founded by a young Chinese hardware hacker known by the handle Zinwa. According to an interview he gave to the YouTube channel Returning Retro, he grew up using BlackBerry handsets and never took to glass‑only smartphones. Realising that countless BlackBerry Classic housings were languishing in drawers or heading for e‑waste dumps, he designed a modern motherboard that would slot into the Q20's existing shell. By reusing the chassis he avoided the high tooling costs of a new enclosure and kept the familiar hardware features that made the Classic popular, such as the physical keyboard, trackpad and headphone jack. The prototype, shown on Returning Retro, maintains the Classic's footprint while supporting 4G/LTE networks, Android 14, a microSD card slot, USB‑C and NFC.


== Hardware specifications ==
The Q25 uses a custom motherboard based on the MediaTek Helio G99 system‑on‑chip with an octa‑core CPU and Mali‑G57 MC2 GPU. It ships with 12 GB of LPDDR4x RAM and 256 GB of UFS 2.x internal storage, expandable via a microSDXC slot. The display is the original BlackBerry Classic 3.5‑inch (8.9 cm) 720×720 pixel IPS panel with a 1:1 aspect ratio. It retains the Q20's backlit QWERTY keyboard and capacitive trackpad; the trackpad functions as either a cursor or directional pad depending on user preference. A 50‑megapixel rear camera and an 8‑megapixel front‑facing camera replace the Classic's original sensors. The onboard 3,000 mAh battery is larger than the original and is charged via a USB‑C port; the device also features a headphone jack, single nano‑SIM slot, NFC support, Bluetooth, Wi‑Fi and 4G LTE connectivity, but it does not support 5G.


== Software ==
Unlike the 2014 BlackBerry Classic, which ran BlackBerry 10, the Q25 runs a near‑stock build of Android 14 with access to Google Play services. Zinwa Technologies has stated that it does not plan to offer major version upgrades beyond Android 14 but will provide security patches and minor feature updates. The developer later confirmed, however, that the bootloader is unlocked, allowing users to install their own software on the device.


== Release and availability ==
Zinwa announced the Q25 project in mid‑2025 and began accepting pre‑orders later that summer. The company offers two products: a ready‑built Q25 handset and a Q25 conversion kit for owners of the BlackBerry Classic who wish to retrofit their own devices. The assembled phone is priced at roughly US$400 while the kit costs about US$300. Ubergizmo reported that the do‑it‑yourself kit costs around US$320 and that the first 100 complete devices were scheduled to ship by the end of August 2025, with mass production targeted for mid‑September. The company also sells replacement modules such as camera boards and batteries.


== Reception ==
Early coverage of the Q25 focused on its blend of nostalgia and modern hardware. NotebookCheck and other commentators noted that the device retained the Classic's signature form factor while offering contemporary specifications like a Helio G99 chipset, 12 GB RAM and a 50 MP camera. Commentators also highlighted the inclusion of a headphone jack, NFC and USB‑C, features that many modern flagship phones have abandoned. Reviewers cautioned that the device lacked 5G support and that Zinwa did not promise long‑term software upgrades, though it committed to bug fixes and security patches.


== Successor and related devices ==
During the Q25's announcement, Zinwa Technologies confirmed that it was working on similar projects based on other BlackBerry models. The company plans to release a P26 based on the BlackBerry Passport and eventually expand to other, older models such as the Bold. These devices are expected to apply the same philosophy of reusing original housings while installing modern internals and Android.
