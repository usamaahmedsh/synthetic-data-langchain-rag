The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 (stylized as Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7) is a foldable smartphone developed and marketed by Samsung Electronics. It was officially announced on July 9, 2025, at the Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event held in Brooklyn, New York City, United States, alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Galaxy Watch 8 series.
Samsung also introduced a derivative model, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE (stylized as Galaxy Z Flip7 FE), which features a slimmer and lighter design and is equipped with a 50 MP main camera, and it is based on the full predecessor.

=== Colors and materials ===
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is available in four color options at launch: Jet Black, Blue Shadow, Coral Red, and Mint. While the first three variants are widely available through general retail channels, Mint is offered exclusively through Samsung's online store. The device features a matte glass back panel an aluminum frame.
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available in two color options: Black and White.
The available color options are summarized in the table below.


=== Main display ===
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 features a 6.9‑inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X main display with a resolution of 2520 × 1080 pixels (21:9 aspect ratio) and a pixel density of approximately 397 ppi. It supports a variable refresh rate from 1 to 120 Hz, enabling adaptive performance based on content type. The display also supports HDR10+ and is protected by Ultra Thin Glass (UTG).


=== Cover screen and FlexWindow ===
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 features a 4.1‑inch Super AMOLED cover screen, referred to by Samsung as the FlexWindow, with a resolution of 1048 × 948 pixels and a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz. Compared to its predecessor Galaxy Z Flip 6, the FlexWindow has been enlarged by approximately 2.2-inches in usable screen area, enabled in part by a 0.7 mm bezel reduction. This results in improved content visibility and expanded touch interaction zones. The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus 2. 
The FlexWindow enables access to widgets, notifications, camera previews, and selected apps—such as Google Gemini, Now Bar, and Now Brief—without unfolding the device.
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE retains the 3.4‑inch Super AMOLED cover display found in the previous generation. It supports basic cover screen features like widgets and camera previews but lacks the expanded app compatibility and AI-driven functions offered by the FlexWindow on the standard model.


== Specifications ==


=== Hardware ===
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is powered by the Exynos 2500 processor, built on a 3 nm fabrication process. It features an octa-core CPU based on the latest Cortex-X5 architecture. To maintain thermal stability during high-performance scenarios such as gaming or multitasking, the device includes a large vapor chamber cooling system.
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE uses the Exynos 2400, a 4 nm deca-core processor configured with one Cortex-X4 core, four Cortex-A720 cores, and five Cortex-A520 cores. It features the Xclipse 940 GPU, developed in collaboration with AMD, supporting hardware-based ray tracing. Unlike the standard model, the FE version uses a more compact thermal system, which may affect sustained performance during extended workloads.
Both models support both sub-6 GHz and mmWave 5G bands (only on US models), Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3 for high-speed wireless connectivity. Biometric authentication is handled via a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.
As part of its physical refinement, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is approximately 0.4 mm thinner when unfolded compared to its predecessor, Galaxy Z Flip 6, contributing to a more compact hardware profile.
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is available with 12 GB of RAM, paired with either 256 GB or 512 GB of internal storage. It utilizes UFS 4.0 storage technology for improved data transfer speeds and energy efficiency.
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE comes with 8 GB of RAM, and storage options include 128 GB, 256 GB, or 512 GB, all based on UFS 4.0. Neither model supports microSD card expansion.


=== Battery ===
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is equipped with a 4,300 mAh dual-cell battery, while the Z Flip 7 FE features a slightly smaller 4,000 mAh dual-cell battery. Both models support 25W wired charging compatible with USB Power Delivery 3.0 and Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, with Samsung stating that up to 50% charge can be achieved in approximately 30 minutes under optimal conditions.
Both models also support 15W wireless and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. The Z Flip 7 includes a larger battery than the FE model, but charging speeds are the same.


=== Camera ===
Both the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Flip 7 FE feature a dual rear camera system comprising a 50 MP wide-angle sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS) and Dual Pixel autofocus, along with a 12 MP ultra-wide sensor offering a 123-degree field of view. Supported camera features include LED flash, HDR, and panorama. Video recording is available in 4K, Full HD, and HD resolutions, with frame rates of up to 240 fps depending on the mode.
The front-facing camera is a 10 MP sensor with HDR support and 4K video recording at 30 and 60 fps.


==== FlexCam ====
FlexCam is a shooting mode that enables hands-free photo and video capture by partially folding the device, typically between 75 and 115 degrees. The mode uses the rear cameras with the cover screen acting as a live viewfinder. Although both models support this feature, the Z Flip 7's larger 4.1-inch cover display provides a broader preview area compared to the 3.4-inch screen on the Z Flip 7 FE.
FlexCam is commonly used for scenarios such as group selfies, vlogging, and video calls. While the core functionality is the same on both devices, the user experience may differ depending on cover screen size and app support.


== Software ==
The Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Flip 7 FE ship with Android 16 and One UI 8. Alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it is promised to get up to seven years of operating system and security updates, which is a policy first introduced with the Galaxy S24 series, making it the second Galaxy Z series phone to do so after the Galaxy Z6 series. Support will end on October 12, 2032.


=== Galaxy AI ===
Galaxy AI features, first introduced with the Galaxy S24 lineup, are supported on both models as part of One UI 8. Key tools include Interpreter, Chat Assist, and Generative Edit, among other available features. These features use a combination of on-device and cloud-based processing, depending on the task and language.
