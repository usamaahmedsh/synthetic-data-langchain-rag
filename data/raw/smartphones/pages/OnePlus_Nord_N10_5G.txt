It has a 4,300 mAh non-removable battery capable of up to Warp Charge 30T (30 W). The phone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 690 5G chip (8nm), with an octa-core processor (2x2.0 GHz Kryo 560 Gold & 6x1.7 GHz Kryo 560 Silver) and an Adreno 619L GPU. The phone comes with 128 GB of UFS 2.1 storage (which can be expanded via microSD) and 6 GB LPDDR4x RAM.
