The HTC One V was a smartphone designed and manufactured by HTC as part of the HTC One series which runs Android 4.0.3 with an HTC Sense 4.0 overlay. This phone was constructed from an aluminum unibody. Its design resembles the HTC Legend released in 2010. It features a 5-megapixel camera, 3.7-inch touchscreen (480×800 resolution), 512 MB RAM, a 1 GHz processor, and Beats audio. Officially announced by HTC on 26 February 2012, the HTC One V was released on 26 April 2012 in the UK.
In December 2012, HTC announced that the One V would not get an upgrade to Android 4.1. Still, in early 2013, independent ROM developers produced several ports of Android 4.1 and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean for the HTC One V, including Shpongle-Evervolv and Paranoid Android.
