The Nokia N93 is a mobile phone from Nokia, part of the multimedia Nseries. It was the most advanced camera phone from Nokia at the time of its release, and Nokia's first phone with optical zoom.
N93 was particularly marketed for its swivel design like its predecessor Nokia N90, which mimics the appearance of a conventional camcorder. The N93 improved upon camera capabilities over the N90. The phone has a 3.2-megapixel camera with 3x optical zoom, Carl Zeiss optics and 30 fps 640×480 (VGA) MPEG-4 video recording capability. It was succeeded by the Nokia N93i.


== Features ==
The Nokia N93 supports 3G (WCDMA 2100 MHz), EDGE and GSM (900/1800/1900 MHz) networks. It also has Push to Talk over Cellular (PoC), Wi-Fi (802.11b and g), an infrared port (for IrDA) and Bluetooth.

The Nokia N93's 3.2-megapixel camera has Carl Zeiss Vario Tessar optics and flash, 3x optical zoom / 20x digital zoom, digital image stabilization, close up mode, and DVD-like video capture at 30 fps in the MPEG-4 format at VGA resolution. It was also advertised for "easy" video creation and burning to DVD with Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0.
Other than the camera, Nokia N93 has a 320×240 pixels; 262,144 colors 2.4" display and direct TV out connectivity.

However despite Nokia having planned to support N-Gage 2.0 for N93 (alongside N73 and N93i), it never made it due to memory issues. Other features are a web browser, Adobe Flash Lite 1.1 preinstalled (supports Flash Lite 2.1 and Flash Lite 3.0 developer editions), Visual Radio, UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) support, Symbian application support, Java MIDP 2.0.
