== Industry reception ==
The Asus PadFone represented an innovative hybrid design that bridged smartphone and tablet functionality. According to a review in CNET (2012), the device featured a 4.3-inch Super AMOLED display with a 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor when used as a smartphone, which expanded to a 10.1-inch display with 1280×800 resolution when docked. TechRadar noted that while the concept was ambitious, battery life limitations and the high price point of approximately $1,300 for the complete system impacted its market adoption. The device ran Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, with Asus implementing custom software to manage the transition between phone and tablet modes.
