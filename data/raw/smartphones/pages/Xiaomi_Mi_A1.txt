The Mi A1 receives OS upgrades for a minimum of two years. The Android Oreo update does not bring a project Treble functionality for device-independent system updates. The device's kernel sources were released in January 2018, 4 months after its release.


=== Mi 5X ===
The Mi 5X is the Chinese market version of the Mi A1, running MIUI over Android. The 5X only differs in its software, having identical hardware to the A1.


== Release ==
The Xiaomi Mi A1 was unveiled on 5 September 2017 and was available in all of Xiaomi's markets at the time, with the exception of the People's Republic of China, where the MIUI based variant, Mi 5X, was released earlier that year.


== Reception ==
Sam Byford of The Verge described Mi A1's most distinct feature is its software that runs on stock Android and not on Xiaomi's MIUI layer. Sahil Gupta of TechRadar wrote that Mi A1's Android One certified experience along with tried and tested hardware, and dual camera capability gives you the premium feel under a budget.
The phone is described as 'giving a resurgence' to the Android One program, being the first Android One phone to be sold worldwide, and the first Android One phone made by a top-5 best-selling smartphone brand. It was also the first mid-range priced phone to feature a dual rear camera setup with a zoom lens.


== Issues ==

At the end of 2017, Android Oreo was released and created major battery draining issues on some devices.
Another issue of Android Oreo was the instability of Wi-Fi connections.
