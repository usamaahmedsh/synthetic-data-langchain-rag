The OnePlus 3T (also abbreviated as OP3T) is a smartphone made by OnePlus. It is the successor to the OnePlus 3 and was revealed on 15 November 2016.
It is an incremental update to the company's flagship phone being released only 6 months later. It features the identical Optic AMOLED display, the same Sony IMX298 rear camera sensor, and the same Dash Charge technology as its predecessor.
The OnePlus 3T is also the first phone from OnePlus to be available for immediate delivery (in Europe and North America), without long waiting times from being out of stock.


== Release ==
The OnePlus 3T was released on 15 November 2016 via a Facebook live video. It went on sale in a new Gunmetal colour with the Soft Gold option being released soon after much like the OnePlus 3. The OnePlus 3T has 6 GB of RAM, the option of 64 or 128 GB of UFS 2.0 storage, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor.
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Colette, a French high fashion, streetwear, and accessory retailer, OnePlus and Colette partnered to produce 250 exclusive limited edition black versions of the phone featuring a Colette logo at the back of the phone. This exclusive edition of the phone went on sale in Paris at a Colette store on 21 March 2017.

=== Hardware ===
The OnePlus 3T has the same metal back design, compared with the OnePlus 3, with anodised aluminium and curved edges. The device is available in two colors, a new Gunmetal (black/gray), which is slightly darker than the Graphite color used in the OnePlus 3 and Soft Gold (white/gold) which was released on 6 January 2017. A limited edition Midnight Black colored phone was available to purchase on 28 March 2017, it featured an all black backing similar to the Colette exclusive limited edition but without the logo.
The OnePlus 3T's darker aluminium backing is the only physical characteristic that allows it to be distinguished from the OnePlus 3. Users can also purchase the same protective covers in Bamboo, Rosewood, Black Apricot, Karbon and Sandstone, which takes care of the camera hump and evens it with the phone.
It features the same Optic AMOLED display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection, in the same casing of the OnePlus 3. The OnePlus 3T now comes in options for 64 GB or 128 GB of UFS 2.0 storage. The phone also features the same alert slider which users can use to quickly toggle between alert modes from silent to priority to all notifications. It includes NFC and the same fast finger scanner which can unlock the device in approximately 0.3 seconds.
The OnePlus 3T contains the same rear-facing Sony IMX298 sensor with 16 MP, 1.1 μm, f/2.0, Optical image stabilization (OIS) and Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), as the predecessor. The phone has an upgraded front-facing Samsung 3P8SP sensor with 16 MP, 1.0 μm, f/2.0 and EIS.
The phone once again has the same OnePlus quick charging capabilities named Dash Charge with the ability to gain 60% of the charge in 30 minutes. According to the company, this is accomplished by doing all the power transforming required for direct input to the battery in the power brick supplied, not within the phone itself, reducing heat on the device. Additionally, the power brick can contain larger, dedicated electronics, whereas any power processing on a phone has to use smaller and cooler equipment, reducing the speed of charging.
The phone comes with a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and a bigger 3400 mAh battery.

== Reception ==
OnePlus 3T generally received a good reception. It was especially praised for its good performance and price to quality ratio. The OnePlus 3T was considered too similar to OnePlus 3 and the increase of the front camera's megapixels was thought to be ineffective in many reviews. Many critics felt the difference was so small that OnePlus 3 owners should not upgrade to OnePlus 3T.


=== Criticism ===
XDA Developers discovered that with the launch of the Android 7.0 Nougat update, OnePlus introduced a software defeat device into the code of the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T, relaxing thermal throttling and increasing clock speeds when the phone detected that it was in a benchmark app, in order to boost benchmark scores. This came as a bit of a shock to much of the Android enthusiast community, as every major manufacturer had removed their benchmark cheating code following the massive backlash that occurred when it was originally discovered on other devices in 2013. OnePlus immediately stated that they would be removing the benchmark cheating from future software versions, and that they weren't sure how it made it into a production build. OnePlus later reversed this decision with the OnePlus 5, reintroducing the software that locked clock speeds to their maximum while in a benchmark.
