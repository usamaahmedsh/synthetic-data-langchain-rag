Series 30+ (abbreviated as S30+) is a software platform and application user interface used for some Nokia-branded and HMD-branded mobile phones. It is the main software used for Nokia feature phones succeeding Series 30 and Series 40. Earlier Series 30+ devices following its inception in 2013 use MediaTek chips and are based on MAUI software, while most devices since 2020 (including all 4G phones) are developed on Unisoc chips and run the Series 30+ interface on top of Mocor RTOS.


== Features ==


=== Compatibility ===
Many S30+ devices only support MAUI Runtime Environment (MRE) and its associated application file (.vxp) developed by MediaTek, but some later devices with MediaTek chips have included support for J2ME (Java) applications. More recent S30+ models are built on Mocor RTOS and are no longer compatible with MRE software.


=== Applications ===
S30+ contain many of the basic mobile phone features. The devices also come preloaded Opera Mini web browser and a Facebook app client.
Some S30+ based on MediaTek MAUI that support MRE applications (except Nokia 220) have an online shop for downloading new apps and games, and several S30+ devices that support J2ME applications, including a model of the Nokia 3310 3G, which ran the preceding Smart Feature OS shipped with access to Opera Mobile Store. Currently, the S30+ online shop was not featured in some devices based on Mocor RTOS due to no longer compatible with MRE/J2ME software.
Generally, Series 30+ is more limited as opposed to KaiOS, an operating system that HMD ships with certain other of its feature phones.


== History ==
Series 30+ was created for Nokia's new MediaTek based phones, having switched away from Base Band 5. It first appeared in September 2013 on the Nokia 108, and has been the main Nokia feature phone operating system after the end of the Series 30 and Series 40 platforms in 2014.

In October 2017, HMD Global released Nokia 3310 3G which (instead of Series 30+) runs on Smart Feature OS, a platform based on Mocor RTOS developed by Unisoc. Before this, in 2015 three Microsoft-branded prototype phones: RM-1181, RM-1182 and RM-1183 were reportedly developed running a prototype version of Smart Feature OS. Photos that surfaced in 2018 showed a redesigned user interface, featuring elements of the Windows 10 Mobile design language and Microsoft Account integration. Early Nokia 3310 3G units ran the same Smart Feature OS as the three Microsoft prototype phones, but featured a different user interface. This design language was later adopted by most Nokia-branded 4G phones running the successor Series 30+ platform, which is based on Mocor RTOS. This includes later models of the Nokia 3310 3G manufactured in 2019. Due to this, since 2018, Smart Feature OS name was later reused as a platform based on KaiOS, starting from Nokia 8110 4G.
Since late 2023, HMD has collaborated with CloudMosa to introduce various cloud-based widgets for feature phones using the Cloud Phone ("Cloud Apps For Feature Phone") technology. This partnership marks the first time that Nokia Series 30+ devices are capable of accessing YouTube, Shorts, TikTok, Google Sign-in Services and real-time modern web applications. The first device to support Cloud Apps on Series 30+ is the Nokia 110 4G (2023), with all devices released in 2023 onwards set to feature this capability through OTA updates. However, the Cloud Phone was not supported in Europe and China.
Since 24 April 2024, HMD launched four new 4G feature phones: Nokia 215 4G (Nokia 220 4G in China, India and Vietnam), 225 4G, 235 4G and Nokia 3210 (2024), all supporting the Cloud Phone technology. The HMD 105, 110 and HMD Barbie Phone are the first three devices that use the brand name HMD, while The Boring Phone is the only device that never use the brand name Nokia or HMD, instead use the brand name Heineken. On their specification sheets, these phones drop the name S30+ in favor of the generic Mocor RTOS name.
On 10 July 2025, a HMD-branded prototype touchscreen phone called HMD Wonka that possibility a revival of Nokia Asha series with the hardware design was similar to Nokia Lumia and HMD Skyline were reportedly developed running a modified version of Mocor RTOS for touchscreen devices. This device featuring several smartphone features, such as Wi-Fi support and have Wi-Fi hotspot, have built-in HMD Chat app, UPI payments app and Cloud Phone technology support, and uses a different graphical user interface that very similar to Android instead of the UI that firstly used in Nokia 3310 3G. When this device officially comfirmed by HMD Global as HMD Touch 4G, it had several changes compared to the prototype version, such as lock screen modified, renamed HMD Chat as Express Chat and reduced the numbers of embedded games (only Snake was still included). 
Later, on 13 July 2025, another HMD-branded prototype touchscreen phone called HMD Compass that possibility a revival of Nokia Asha series like HMD Wonka, with the hardware design was similar to Nokia Asha 501 were reportedly developed running a modified version of Mocor RTOS for touchscreen devices. This device have several features similar to the HMD Wonka but also have several differents, such as different lock screen and featuring a app called GoPlay.
