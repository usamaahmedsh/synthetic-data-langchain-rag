== Reception ==
The Vivo V50 has been praised for its slim design, vibrant display, and long-lasting battery, positioning it as a strong contender in the mid-range smartphone market. Critics have noted its camera performance, particularly in portrait photography, as a highlight due to the Zeiss collaboration. However, some reviews pointed out the use of UFS 2.2 storage instead of the faster UFS 3.1 or 4.0 as a limitation compared to competitors like the OnePlus 13R and Motorola Edge 50 Pro.


== Variants ==
Unlike previous V-series releases, Vivo did not announce a V50 Pro model at launch. However, a Vivo V50e variant was teased in India, featuring a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chipset, a 6.7-inch AMOLED display, and a 5600 mAh battery, with a launch scheduled for April 10, 2025.
