The Vilnius–Lublin Portal is a public attraction that videoconferences between separate outdoor structures in Vilnius, Lithuania, and Lublin, Poland.


== Description ==
The portal connects Vilnius, Lithuania, and Lublin, Poland, through large, public structures that use videoconference technology, with a camera showing one location on the screen of the other.


== Development ==
A similar earlier work, the Telectroscope, was in place between New York and London in 2008. Benediktas Gylys wanted his similar work to unify and develop empathy in onlookers. The project is a joint venture between the Benediktas Gylys Foundation, the Cities of Vilnius and Lublin, and the latter's Center for Intercultural Creative Initiatives. The portal took five years to develop into its final form. Engineers from Vilnius Gediminas Technical University's Creativity and Innovation Center designed the portal. It was designed as a circle to recall themes of time and from science fiction. Each portal weighs 11 tons.
The project totaled €111,000 in costs. The project had won a competition to spur tourism in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital city.
The group plans future portals from Vilnius to Reykjavík and London.


== Reception ==
A writer for The Verge likened the portal to creations from the Stargate media universe.
