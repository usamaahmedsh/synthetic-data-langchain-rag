== Reception ==
The smartphone received mostly positive feedback upon its launch because of its great battery life, CPU performance, good thermal performance, great price-to-performance ratio and a great day-to-day performance.
GSMArena states: “The Redmi Note 4(X)'s Snapdragon 625, which we consider to be the ultimate mid-range chipset for this generation, provides excellent performance with great power efficiency and thermal properties. The battery life of this phone is jaw-dropping, the MIUI experience is smooth, and the camera does well in all occasions. All these goodies come in a sturdy metal body, which adds to the already great value of the Redmi Note 4(X).” Also, in GSMArena's device review, the Snapdragon edition of the phone scored much better than the specified figures, getting a 1500:1 Contrast ratio, 484 nits of maximum luminance and excellent colour accuracy for the class.[1] 
According to AndroidAuthority: “The Redmi Note 4(X) is not perfect, but it is a well-rounded package that one wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for a budget or mid-range smartphone. Packed in a neat chassis, the smartphone performs great and is a compelling value-for-money smartphone.”
Gadgets360 also rated the phone 8 of 10, appreciating the device for its battery efficiency, good performance for the class and good thermal efficiency.
AndroidCentral also considered Redmi Note 4 (SD variant) to be one of the best smartphones one can buy in the mid-budget range, even after 6 months of launch.
TechRadar called Redmi Note 4 to be an overall impressive device overall, though lacking the X factor, getting 4/5 ratings.
Initially, upon launch, it was not received as the true successor of the Redmi Note 3 (Snapdragon variant) mostly because of the use of the Snapdragon 625 as opposed to the Snapdragon 650 in Redmi Note 3 in terms of the RAW performance of the CPU and GPU. Though perceived initially as a theoretical downgrade by media, XDA Developers also considered the device an upgrade to Redmi Note 3, citing its overall sustained performance, on par day-to-day performance and better battery and thermal performance by a good margin. The new Snapdragon 625 was well received by users as well as reviewers after using the device for a while owing to the better fabrication process, battery life and thermal efficiency of the new chipset over the Snapdragon 650.
