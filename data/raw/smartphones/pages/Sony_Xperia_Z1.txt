The Sony Xperia Z1 is an Android smartphone produced by Sony. The Z1, at that point known by the project code name "Honami", was unveiled during a press conference in IFA 2013 on 4 September 2013. The phone was released in China on 15 September 2013, in the UK on 20 September 2013, and entered more markets in October 2013. On 13 January 2014, the Sony Xperia Z1s, a modified version of the Sony Xperia Z1 exclusive to T-Mobile US, was released in the United States.
Like its predecessor, the Sony Xperia Z, the Xperia Z1 is waterproof and dustproof, and has an IP rating of IP55 and IP58.  The key highlight of the Z1 is the 20.7 megapixel camera, paired with Sony's in-house G lens and its image processing algorithm called BIONZ. The phone also comes with Sony's new camera user interface, dedicated shutter button and has an aluminium and glass unibody design.

=== Hardware ===
The Sony Xperia Z1's design is "Omni-Balance", according to Sony, which is focused on creating balance and symmetry in all directions. Xperia Z1 has subtly rounded edges and smooth, reflective surfaces on all sides, which are held together by a skeleton frame made from aluminium. The phone features tempered glass, which is Sony's own, and they claim is even tougher than Gorilla Glass, front and back, covered by shatterproof film on front and back. The aluminium power button is placed on the right side of the device. A dedicated hardware shutter key for easy access to the camera is provided on the lower right side. The location is said to make operation easier. The metallic look and positioning of the power button is inspired by luxury watch crown design. Easy access to external memory card and sim card slots are provided. The sim card can be removed easily with bare hands. The phone is available in three colours: black, white, and purple. The Xperia Z1 is thicker (8.5 mm) and heavier (169 g) and has thicker screen bezels than the Xperia Z, even though the two phones share the same screen size. Sony said that the frame had to be enlarged due to the larger than average camera sensor. The camera sensor size is 1/2.3" same as commonly are used in bridge camera. The phone is certified waterproof to 1.5 m for up to 30 minutes. The Z1 is dust resistant with an IP rating of 55 and 58. Unlike the Xperia Z, the Xperia Z1 doesn't have a flap covering its headphone jack, but maintains its waterproofing, a move welcomed by many due to the waterproofing warranty on the Sony Xperia Z being reliant on all ports being sealed. Additional less obvious connectivity includes support for USB OTG allowing for the connection of external USB devices as well as support for MHL output connection. The Xperia Z1 comes with 2 GB of RAM and Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor clocked at 2.15 GHz. It also contains a 5.0-inch Sony Triluminos and its X-Reality Engine for better image and video viewing, the display's resolution is 1920×1080 with 441 pixels per inch. The Sony Xperia Z1 has a 3000mAh battery.


=== Software ===
The Xperia Z1 was initially shipped with Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) with Sony's custom launcher on top. Some notable additions to the software include Sony's Media applications – Walkman, Album and Videos. NFC is also a core feature of the device, allowing 'one touch' to mirror what is on the smartphone to compatible TVs or play music on a NFC wireless speaker. Additionally, the device includes a battery stamina mode which increases the phone's standby time up to 4 times. Several Google applications (such as Google Chrome, Google Play, Google search (with voice), Google Maps and Google Talk) already come preloaded. Sony also radically changed its camera user-interface; it added new features, such as TimeShift and Augmented reality (AR) effects such as a walking dinosaur.

=== Camera ===

With a focus on camera, Xperia Z1 also introduces many new camera modes and apps.

Social live, developed in cooperation with Bambuser, allows users to broadcast their video live via Facebook and gets comments from their friends in real time.
Info-eye instantly gives information about the objects captured by Xperia Z1's camera.
Timeshift-burst captures 61 frames within 2 seconds, starting before the shutter button is pressed, allowing users to select the best picture. But shooting in 1080p resolution.

Creative Effect gives options for various photographic toning effects.
Sweep Panorama takes panoramic views of almost 270 degrees viewing perspective.

Although featuring similar CPU and GPU chipsets as used in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 that supports 4K@30fps and 1080p@60fps video recording, the Xperia Z1's video recording is capped at 1080p@30fps.
However, this limitation can be bypassed by applying custom third-party modifications to the device.
A gimmick in the Z1's camera software is the "Clear image zoom" feature within the “Superior Auto” mode, which is a simple lossless digital zoom enabled by a lower (8 megapixel) resolution setting on a 20 megapixel sensor.


=== Remote-controllable ===
The phone is capable of being fully remote-controlled from a computer through the free TeamViewer QuickSupport app.


== Variants ==

== Reception ==
A CNET.co.uk review liked the sleek, waterproof design, powerful core and sharp, bright screen. A Wired review by Dave Oliver thought the phone felt heavy but liked the screen, sharp image and covered expansion slot covers.
