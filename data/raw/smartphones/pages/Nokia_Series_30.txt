Nokia Series 30, often shortened as S30, is a software platform and application user interface that was previously used by Nokia for its basic entry-level mobile phones. Unlike Series 40, Series 30 phones are not capable of running Java apps and do not have Internet access for web browsing and email.


== History and features ==
Series 30 was originally developed for the Nokia DCT4 hardware platform as a replacement of Series 20 on the older DCT3. The first phones with Series 30 and DCT4 were Nokia 8310 and Nokia 6310 released in 2001. The user interface on early S30 was almost identical to S20 but had several technical improvements including GPRS support.

Nokia created Series 40 optimised for colour displays in 2002 after which Series 30 continued solely for ultrabasic (1xxx and 2xxx) monochrome phones. The Nokia 2600 became the first low-end Series 30 phone with a colour display in 2004.
Most S30 phones have only a 4-way d-pad. The Nokia 1100 and Nokia 2100 have just have a 2-way d-pad. Early basic S30 phones had just one soft key, but Nokia 1110 released in 2005 was the first to have two keys.
The last S30 devices were released in 2013, after which Nokia switched to MediaTek system-on-chips and it was succeeded by Series 30+.
