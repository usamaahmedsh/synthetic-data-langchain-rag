On January 2, 2017, Samsung unveiled the 2017 edition of the Galaxy A series, comprising three models. This move marks Samsung's first product launch since the discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7 back in October 2016. Following the unveiling, Samsung announced that they would sell up to 20 million smartphones, targeting Western and Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.


== General features ==
Newly improved features include 16-megapixel front and back cameras, an Exynos 7 Octa 7880 SoC, a 3D glass display (similar to Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S7), barometer and gyroscope sensors and IP68 certification  for water and dust resistance as well as support for Gear 360 (2017). The new design of the series are very similar to the Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge, released in March 2016. This was the last Galaxy A series to use the TouchWiz user interface, before being superseded by Samsung Experience and One UI in later models.


== Models ==


=== Galaxy A3 ===
This series' Galaxy A3 runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with TouchWiz user interface right out-of-the-box, but was updated during August 2017 to Android 7.0 Nougat and once again in February 2018 to run Android 8.0 Oreo. The smartphone features an Exynos 7870 SoC consisting an octa-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU and Mali-T830 GPU and backed by 2 GB RAM and 16 GB internal storage expandable to 256 GB via the MicroSD slot which can also be used for a second Nano-SIM. 
The device retains a non-removable battery like its predecessor and its battery is rated at 2350mAh. Its extra features similar to the features found in Samsung's 2016 flagships include IP68 water resistance, Always On Display, and 3D glass backing with Gorilla Glass 4. A new "Always On Display" functionality displays a clock, calendar, and notifications on-screen when the device is in standby. It also features an FM radio.
This handset is currently the last in the A3 series, and also the last Samsung handset to feature a screen smaller than 5" (excluding the Japan-only Galaxy Feel).
Just like its predecessors, the Galaxy A3 (2017) was not made available in the United States, China, Malaysia and India.


=== Galaxy A5 ===

This series' Galaxy A5 runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow right out of the box and runs on TouchWiz interface, but was updated during August 2017 to Android 7.0 Nougat and once again in February 2018 to run Android 8.0 Oreo. The smartphone features an Exynos 7880 SoC consisting of 8 ARM Cortex-A53 backed by the Mali-T830 GPU and sports 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB internal storage, expandable to 256 GB via a dedicated MicroSD slot that it has unlike the predecessors of the A5 (which it was placed in the second Nano-SIM slot). The device retains a non-removable battery like its predecessor, rated at 3000 mAh with fast-charging capabilities. Its extra features similar to Samsung's 2016 flagships include IP68 water resistance, Always On Display and 3D glass backing with Gorilla Glass 4. A new "Always On display" functionality displays a clock, calendar and notifications on screen when the device is in standby.
Unlike its predecessors, the Galaxy A5 (2017) was not released in the United States. However, the Galaxy A5 (2017) was going to be sold in Canada, unlike the 2016 edition.


=== Galaxy A7 ===
This series' Galaxy A7 runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out-of-the-box and runs on Grace UX interface (and upgradable to Android 7.0 "Nougat" and Android 8.0 "Oreo" with Samsung Experience 8.1 and 9.0 respectively). The smartphone features an Exynos 7880 SoC consisting of 8 ARM Cortex-A53 backed by the Mali-T830MP3 GPU and sports 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage, expandable to 256 GB via a MicroSD card slot. Unlike the previous version of the A7, it has a dedicated MicroSD card slot allowing both a second SIM Card in dual SIM models and MicroSD card to be used at the same time.
The device retains a non-removable battery like its predecessor, rated at 3600mAh with fast-charging capabilities. Its extra features, similar to Samsung's 2016 flagship's, include IP68 water resistance, Always-on Display, and 3D glass backing with Gorilla Glass 4. A new "Always On display" functionality displays a clock, calendar, and notifications on-screen when the device is in standby. The Galaxy A7 2017 received the latest and last Android 8.0 Oreo update in 2018.
Unlike its predecessors, the Galaxy A7 will not be coming to the United States, Western and Central Europe as well as Caucasus countries and China. While Samsung Galaxy A7 (2015) had broader availability in Europe, this model was never sold in that region because it was being deemed too expensive and also due to near-direct competition against Samsung Galaxy S7. Samsung will instead sell the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) and Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) to these countries instead.


=== Custom ROMs ===
The Galaxy A5 and A7 allow for bootloader unlocking and custom ROMs installs, and as a result the phone can be upgraded to Android 11 with the degoogled iodéOS.


== Critical reception ==
Svet Kompjutera praised A3 and A5's build quality and performance, noting that the difference in speed between the two is not great in everyday usage. A5's camera was assessed as above-average in the market segment. The price of A5 was judged as reasonable, but A3's price was seen unfavorably.
