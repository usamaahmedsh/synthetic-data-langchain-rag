Samsung Galaxy (Korean: 삼성 갤럭시; branded in Japan from 2015 to 2023 only  as Galaxy) is a series of computing devices, designed, manufactured, and marketed by Samsung Electronics since 29 June 2009. 
The product line includes the Galaxy S series of high-end smartphones, the Galaxy Z series of foldable smartphones, the Galaxy A, M, and F series of mid-range and budget smartphones, the Galaxy Tab series of tablets, and the Galaxy Watch series of smartwatches. The Galaxy TabPro S is the first Samsung Galaxy-branded Windows 10 device that was announced at CES 2016. In 2020, Samsung added the Galaxy Chromebook 2-in-1 laptop running ChromeOS to the Galaxy branding lineup. The Samsung Galaxy XR, first released on 21 October 2025, is one of the first major extended-reality devices to feature the Android XR operating system.
Samsung Galaxy devices come with a user interface called One UI (with previous versions being known as Samsung Experience and TouchWiz).
The Samsung Galaxy series is noteworthy for its pioneering role in bringing Android into mainstream popularity beginning in the early 2010s and still having popularity to this day with their high-quality smartphones.


== History ==
The Samsung Galaxy was launched in June 2009 as Samsung's first Android powered device. At the time, the brand's flagship smartphone was the Samsung Omnia and its successor, powered by Windows Mobile. Omnia had been the second full-touch Samsung device running the TouchWiz user interface (after the Tocco), but the Galaxy had an unmodified Android interface; the TouchWiz UI made its way to the Galaxy series with the Galaxy S. The Galaxy S and its successor Galaxy S II became very successful, eclipsing the company's other lines and operating systems. During the decade, the Galaxy phones "became the company's most-praised products [and] also were among the best-selling smartphones in the world."

== Software ==

Samsung Galaxy smartphones run the Android operating system under the Google Mobile Services platform, however Samsung and third-parties have bundled various other software in them too. The TouchWiz interface was used until 2017, replaced by Samsung Experience. This was then replaced by One UI in 2019.
The company has created many apps and services under the Galaxy brand specifically for these devices - many of which come preloaded - including the Galaxy Store which provides apps and customizations. Since late 2019, several Microsoft apps like Outlook also come preloaded on Galaxy as a result of a Samsung-Microsoft partnership.


=== Security ===
Samsung has been caught quietly installing an Israeli bloatware application known as AppCloud in its phone lineup, in particular, the West Asian and North African regions. This app is known for collecting large amounts of sensitive personal data, without a chance to opt-out or uninstall the app without achieving root access due to it falling under the system app umbrella. This process of gaining root access would trip the Samsung Knox E-fuse and void the warranty in the event this is achieved by use of bootloader unlocking, which has recently become impossible on all Samsung devices running OneUI 8 or above, as the code for unlocking the bootloader has been completely stripped from not only the settings app, but also the bootloader itself. 


=== Interoperability ===

Samsung have made several tools for making various Galaxy devices like phones, tablets and watches, work closer together. Samsung Flow is a feature allowing content to be synced with a PC, such as notifications, replying to messages and authenticating from a PC, and sharing content. It was announced in November 2014, released in a preview form in May 2015 and final released in May 2016. Microsoft's Phone Link also comes on Galaxy smartphones since 2019.
Another feature named Multi Control allows controlling of a Galaxy smartphone with a Galaxy Book keyboard and mouse, and drag and drop files between them. Device Control is another feature in the quick panel that can control SmartThings and other devices.

=== Region locking and CSC codes ===
Starting from the Galaxy Note 3, Samsung phones and tablets contained a warning label stating that it would only operate with SIM cards from the region the phone was sold in. A spokesperson clarified the policy, stating that it was intended to prevent grey-market reselling, and that it only applied to the first SIM card inserted. For devices to use a SIM card from other regions, one of the following actions totaling five minutes or longer in length must first be performed with the SIM card from the local region:

Make calls on the phone or watch from the Samsung Phone app
Use the Call and Text on Other Devices feature to make calls
With the launch of the Galaxy S8 series in 2017, that process has changed. Due to the fact that many variants use a Multi-CSC, it will only work with SIM cards from the same CSC group. For example, an AT&T SIM card will not work on cellular-based Galaxy devices sold in Europe and other countries.

== Over the Horizon ==

"Over the Horizon" is the trademark sound for Samsung smartphone devices, first introduced in 2011 on the Galaxy S II. It was composed by Joong-sam Yun and appears as music in the music library of most Samsung phones released since 2011. Prior to 2011, "Beyond Samsung" served as Samsung's trademark music track, while "Samsung Tune" was used as the default ringtone. The sound appears as the default ringtone, as well as the sound when the phone turns on or off (a snippet is used), and as a notification sound. While the basic composition of the six-note tune has not changed since its inception, various versions of different genres have been introduced as the product line evolved.
While the first two versions were created in-house at Samsung, later versions were outsourced to external musicians. The sound has been covered by various popular artists who have released their own arrangements and remixes of the song, such as Quincy Jones, Icona Pop, Suga of BTS, and various K-pop artists. In Samsung's U.S. registration of the trademark for the sound, it is described as "the sound of a bell playing a B4 dotted eighth note, a B4 sixteenth note, an F#5 sixteenth note, a B5 sixteenth note, an A#5 eighth note, and an F#5 half note".
