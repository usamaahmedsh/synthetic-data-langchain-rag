=== Hardware ===
The Redmi Go has several similarities with the 4A and 5A. All three phones have the same display and processor, however, the Redmi Go has less RAM, less storage and a lower-resolution camera. The dimensions and battery size are also identical to that of the 5A. A polycarbonate unibody construction is used, and black and blue color options are available. It lacks USB-C and instead relies on an older MicroUSB port. Neither a fingerprint sensor nor facial recognition are present.


=== Software ===
The Redmi Go runs on Android 8.1 "Oreo" Go Edition and does not use MIUI unlike other Redmi phones.


== Reception ==
Gadgets360 gave the Go a 7/10, praising the device's affordability, design and battery life, while criticizing the cameras as well as the limited RAM and storage.
