The T-Mobile myTouch or myTouch series is a product line of private label smartphones manufactured by HTC, LG and Huawei sold and marketed in the United States by T-Mobile USA under the T-Mobile brand. Each phone in the series runs a version of the Android software stack.
The T-Mobile myTouch 3G is a version of the HTC Magic, but the T-Mobile myTouch 3G Slide and the T-Mobile myTouch 4G are both unique to T-Mobile USA.
The myTouch series has thus far included simultaneous marketing of slider-keyboarded and keyless versions of otherwise similarly equipped models.
