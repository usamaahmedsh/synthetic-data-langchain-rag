The Microsoft Lumia 535 is an entry-level smartphone developed by Microsoft Mobile that runs the Windows Phone 8.1 OS and is upgradable to Windows 10 Mobile. The phone features a 5-inch display.

== Reception ==
Jim Martin from PC Advisor wrote: "We're fans of Windows Phone 8.1 but the Lumia 535 compromises in too many areas to make it a bargain at £100. You're better off with a Motorola Moto E or – if you want 4G – the EE Kestrel."
Katharine Byrne from Expert Reviews wrote that "Microsoft's Lumia 535 is well-built, but poor battery life and a fussy touchscreen makes it frustrating to use."
According to Microsoft, the Lumia 535 became the best-selling mid-range smartphone in Pakistan.


== Issues ==
Since the release, users have detected numerous problems regarding the phone's touch screen. Microsoft has stated that these problems are caused by a software bug and released an update in January 2015 to fix it. Another update in March partially fixed the issue and users who are still experiencing the issue are advised to contact Microsoft Care.
