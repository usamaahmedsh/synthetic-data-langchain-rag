David Pierce of The Verge in his review wrote: "There are things to like about the Titan II, but it has two fatal flaws: an operating system that’s still a cycle behind... and the competition. If you're in the market for a smartphone, be sure Windows Phone is the OS you need. At the moment it’s still in its infancy, and well behind iOS and Android in some key areas."
Brad Molen of Engadget in his review wrote: "Overall, we have very few qualms with the HTC Titan II. Despite its clumsier design, it certainly has more to offer than its predecessor, which was already considered a great phone when it was released on AT&T a scant five months ago (six months if you count the European launch). But is there any reason to fork out $200 for a Windows Phone that has roughly the same feature set as the less expensive Nokia Lumia 900, which is getting subsidized beyond our wildest dreams? Unless you're a camera enthusiast, we think your money could be put to better use elsewhere."
