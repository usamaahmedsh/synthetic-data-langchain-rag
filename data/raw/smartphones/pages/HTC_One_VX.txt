The HTC One VX is an Android smartphone designed and manufactured by HTC. Released on November 16, 2012, by AT&T, it is a mid-range device carrying design traits from the remaining One series devices (such as the One X).


== Inside ==
The One VX is equipped with Google's operating system Android version 4.0, also called Ice Cream Sandwich. Layered on top of the standard Android interface is a graphical shell from HTC called HTC Sense UI. This is already the fourth version of the graphics shell and has been completely redesigned as was actually intended, to make everything look as spacious as possible. The phone also features Beats Audio, a technology that should make sound better.
