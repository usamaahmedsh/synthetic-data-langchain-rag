== Products ==
Products in Leadtek's Computer Group include 3D graphics accelerators (of the NVIDIA GeForce line, mainstream and workstation-class). Currently, Leadtek's product lines are covering computer gaming graphics cards, workstation graphics cards, AI software and hardware, AI cloud supercomputing workstations, desktop virtualization Zero Client/Thin Client, smart medical/health care, school research and big data.
In 2019, Leadtek acquired the world-renowned oximeter brand Alvital. Through non-invasive, fast, and accurate measurement of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate, its oximeters gained recognition and were purchased by governments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The brand also obtained international medical certifications, including FDA (USA), PMDA (Japan), and TFDA (Taiwan), aiding countries severely affected by COVID-19. This contributed to a gradual increase in Leadtek's revenue from its medical business in recent years. In 2023, Leadtek launched a home sleep monitoring service, offering market-oriented solutions and sleep screening services to address the needs of individuals with insomnia. This initiative aims to solve the pain points of the insomnia population, further expanding Leadtek's footprint in the healthcare market.
