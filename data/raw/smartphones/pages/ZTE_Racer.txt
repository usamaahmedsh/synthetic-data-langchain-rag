== Reviews ==
The ZTE Racer was targeted at the relatively small-budget Android market, and at a £99 introductory price was a good competitor with plentiful features, wireless connectivity, good still camera quality, great battery life and FM radio. The downsides of the device are the resistive touch-screen, bad resolution, screen viewing angles, general build quality and camera video quality being the main criticism of the device.
