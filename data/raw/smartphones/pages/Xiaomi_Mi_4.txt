The Xiaomi Mi 4 (Chinese: 小米手机4) is a smartphone developed by the Chinese electronics manufacturer Xiaomi for its high-end smartphone line, and was released in August 2014. Xiaomi held an event to formally introduce the high-end phone, and its complementary smart-accessory, the Xiaomi MiBand, during the Xiaomi New Product Launch Event 2014 on 22 July 2014.
Similar to the principle of the Xiaomi Mi2, the Mi 4 is a highly revamped version of its predecessor, the Xiaomi Mi3. The phone is of a different design to its predecessor. It was also released slightly before the new MIUI 6, which was introduced in August 2014.
Reception towards the device was generally positive, though there were still a high amount of negative feedback from users of Apple's iPhone due to its similar design and quality. Some media companies hailed it to be one of the best smartphones available in the market due to its high-end hardware which is sold at a lower price compared to competitor smartphones. However, others criticized it for being too similar to Apple's iPhone 5S.

=== Operating system and software ===

The Xiaomi Mi 4 ships with MIUI V5 (upgradable to MIUI V10), Xiaomi's variant of the Android operating system. The user interface of MIUI is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the Android operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to the movement of the device such as rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode). The device includes an updater application that allows it to update its OS to the latest version of MIUI available to it.
