== Censorship ==
In September 2021, the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence recommended against purchasing or using Chinese mobile phones. It asked that the existing phones should be thrown away after the defence ministry's National Cyber Security Centre found that Xiaomi devices have built-in censorship capabilities that can be turned on remotely. Xiaomi phones sold in Europe had a built-in ability to detect and censor terms such as "Free Tibet", "Long live Taiwan independence" or "democracy movement". This capability was discovered in Xiaomi’s flagship phone Mi 10T 5G. The list of terms which could be censored by the Xiaomi phone's system apps, including the default web browser, in September 2021 includes 449 terms in Chinese and the list was continuously updated.
The National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania also reported that the phone sends usage data to a server in Singapore.
