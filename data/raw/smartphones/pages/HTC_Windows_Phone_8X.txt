Chuong Nguyen from Gotta Be Mobile in his review wrote: "From a hardware perspective, HTC has done a great job creating a minimalist and modern design. It’s the software still that may be the big barrier for Windows Phone adoption as the platform still trails behind popular rivals iOS and Android in some key areas, including search, voice commands, and voice-guided navigation." and "And while the software is more refined, it just seems that Microsoft is just catching up to rivals, but with Windows Phone 8, it’s still clear that the platform still hasn’t fully caught up quite just yet."
Phil Lavelle from TechRadar wrote: "The HTC 8X promised so much on paper and the excitement leading to it arriving was building up for us. Yet when it arrived, we found it to be a mediocre handset and this is the best of the two WP8 phones HTC is launching. Which means it's not even the best value."
Myriam Joire from Engadget wrote: "Yes, the 8X is a fantastic ambassador to Windows Phone 8, but after using it for several days, we're longing for a similar phone from HTC running Android -- at least until a stronger app ecosystem develops for Microsoft's latest mobile OS."
The HTC 8X won a Red Dot Product Design award in 2013. Prof. Dr. Peter Zec, initiator and CEO of the red dot design award, said: “HTC’s Windows Phone 8X and 8S not only demonstrated an extraordinary design quality, but also showed that design is an integral part of innovative product solutions. We are pleased to award the ‘red dot’ to HTC.”
Some reviewers noted some problems. The phone reboots randomly, which was supposed to be solved after the "Portico" update, but after the update it sometimes continues rebooting randomly. The color coating also peels off revealing a smooth undercoat.


== Windows 10 ==
Despite earlier rumours, it is confirmed that the HTC Windows Phone 8X will not be upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile.
