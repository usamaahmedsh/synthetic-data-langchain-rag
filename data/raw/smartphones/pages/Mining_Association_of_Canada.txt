Canada's mining sector is the world's top producer of potash and ranks among the top five producers of various minerals, including aluminum, cobalt, diamonds, fluorspar, gemstones, gold, indium, niobium, palladium, platinum, tellurium, titanium concentrate, and uranium.
The 60 different minerals and metals that Canada's mining industry produces are essential raw materials for everyday products and advanced technologies that support the shift to a low-carbon economy.
