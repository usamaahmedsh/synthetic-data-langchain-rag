=== Cross-promotion ===
The AdDuplex cross-promotion platform allows developers to gain more exposure by helping each other. For each 10 ads one shows in his app, his ad will be displayed 8 times in other apps on the network. The platform supports different formats, including text, image banners and full-screen (interstitial) ads.


=== Advertising campaigns ===
AdDuplex enables developers to run targeted paid ad campaigns to acquire new users. Self-service client area puts advertisers in control of their spending, performance and other metrics of the campaign.


=== Direct campaigns ===
AdDuplex Direct provides a list of well performing Windows Store apps and games. It enables developers and advertisers to concentrate on cooperation.


== Fill rate ==
AdDuplex provides content to users. This is extremely important for developers who already monetize their apps with in-app advertising. AdDuplex is often set up as a fallback to other ad networks. Generally, whenever the ad space is not being monetized by other ad networks, the app receives free promotion on AdDuplex.
