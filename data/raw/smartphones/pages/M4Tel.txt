In April 2012, M4Tel was founded with the objective of being the first mexican firm to develop and sell smartphones. 
In 2017, M4 shifted its business from smartphones to focus on new devices for wireless internet and the Internet of Things. M4 entered the electronics market with the M4 MiFi Freedom, a portable modem of versatile size capable of connecting up to 10 users simultaneously.
In 2018, M4 and MediaTek presented the new B2 and B3 smartphones, intended to compete with big brands in the mid-range market in Mexico.
The company ceased to exist between 2020 and 2021, given its inactivity on all the company's official social media accounts.
