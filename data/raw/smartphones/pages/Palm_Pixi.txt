The Palm Pixi and Palm Pixi Plus are multimedia smartphones, developed by Palm. The original Pixi was announced on September 8, 2009, on Palm's official blog and was released on November 15, 2009, on the Sprint carrier network in the U.S. It was viewed as a successor to the Palm Centro and was Palm's second webOS device, after the Palm Pre.
The phones were considered the smallest "smartphones" on the market and are able to browse the internet, access Facebook and other social media sites, as well as online banking.
The Pixi Plus was announced at CES in 2010. The Plus versions include Wi-Fi and the ability to act as a 3G Mobile hotspot (sometimes known as MiFi). This phone was released January 7, 2010, for the Verizon Wireless carrier network, and subsequently for AT&T Mobility, and was released on May 28, 2010, for O2 in the United Kingdom.
The HP Veer is considered to be the successor to the Palm PIxi and Pixi Plus, after Palm was purchased by HP.
