The Samsung Galaxy A72 is a mid-range Android-based smartphone developed and manufactured by Samsung Electronics. The phone, announced alongside the Galaxy A52 at Samsung's virtual Awesome Unpacked event on 17 March 2021, serves as the successor to the Galaxy A71. The Galaxy A72 retains many of the features of its previous iteration, but also includes an upgraded 5,000 mAh battery, IP67 water and dust resistance, and the inclusion of an 8 MP telephoto camera. Unlike its predecessor, the Galaxy A72 doesn't have a 5G variant (a 5G A7x model would later return to its successor).
