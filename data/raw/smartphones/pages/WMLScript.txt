WMLScript is a procedural programming language and dialect of JavaScript used for WML pages that is part of the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP).
WMLScript is a client-side scripting language and is similar to JavaScript. Similarly to JavaScript, WMLScript is used for tasks such as user input validation, generation of error messages, and other dialog boxes.
WMLScript is based on ECMAScript (European Computer Manufacturers Association Script), which is JavaScript's standardized version. Thus, the syntax of WMLScript is similar to JavaScript, but not fully compatible. WMLScript does not have objects or arrays like Javascript does. It does allow the programmer to declare and include external functions from other scripts. WMLScript is optimised for low power consumption and is a compiled language.
