The Sony Ericsson P1 is a mobile phone and the successor of the P990. It was the last of the Sony Ericsson "P" Smartphone series, introduced in 2002 with the Sony Ericsson P800 and it integrates many of the hardware features of its predecessor the P990 in the form factor of the M600. It was announced on 8 May 2007. There is a Chinese version of P1 called P1c. Compare with P1/ P1i, P1c lacks of 3G, thereby using EDGE which is much slower but more available especially in the US and parts of Europe.
The phone uses the UIQ 3.0 software platform, which is based upon Symbian OS 9.1. It is slightly thicker than the M600 as a result of the new hardware features, but this is reportedly largely indiscernible. It is nonetheless considerably thinner than the P990 (25% smaller - as the official press review states).


== Key improvements ==
While the phone used the same Nexperia PNX4008 processor as its predecessor, the included RAM was doubled to 128 MB, resulting in significantly more free RAM after boot-up. As a result of its increased RAM, the P1's multitasking performance was far more stable than that of the first series of UIQ 3 phones from Sony Ericsson (P990, M600 and W950). The boot speed, when compared to the P990, is also discernibly faster.
The P1 uses the form factor of the M600 and consequently shares its screen size of 2.6 inches, making it 0.2 inches smaller than its predecessor. However, due to the new transflective layer on its LCD display, legibility under direct sunlight has been improved on the P1. This addresses a common problem faced by owners of the P990.
The phone has 256 MB of built-in flash memory; twice as much as its predecessor, with 160 MB available to the user. The phone also supports expansion using  Memory Stick Micro slot cards, up to 16 GB in size.
