Huawei Mediapad M5 is a series of tablets designed and marketed by Huawei, comprising three models: an 8.4 inch model, a 10.8 inch model, and a 10.8 inch Pro model. Each model came with a Wi-Fi version and a Wi-Fi+LTE version.
For the larger variant, Huawei also includes a desktop mode which allows the user to switch the mobile interface to a traditional desktop interface, by pairing with a keyboard accessory that allows it to work like a laptop.
The Huawei Mediapad M5 is a compact, high-performance Android tablet released to the market in 2018, filling the market gap after Sony's exit from the tablet market.
In 2020, the next M6 model was released based on the 7 nm Kirin 980.
The M5 has a USB-C port, however it supports USB 2.0, not USB 3.0, so it does not support HDMI over USB. It does support screen mirroring.
