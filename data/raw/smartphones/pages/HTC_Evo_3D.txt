The HTC Evo 3D is a 3D-enabled Android smartphone developed by HTC, released exclusively in the United States through Sprint, and was re-released as a pre-paid smartphone by Virgin Mobile in May 2012 as the HTC Evo V 4G. A variation of Sprint's flagship HTC Evo 4G, the device is distinguished by its pair of 5 MP rear cameras, which made the Evo 3D the first cell phone to do so, which can be used to take photos or video in stereographic 3D, which can be viewed on its  autostereoscopic display without the need for 3D glasses. Several GSM variants are also available in Canada, Europe and Asia.


== History ==
Sprint announced the HTC EVO 3D during its CTIA in Orlando, Florida, in March 2011.
In June 2011, Sprint officially announced that the HTC Evo 3D would be available on June 24, 2011.
On May 31, 2012, shortly after the release of its successor, the HTC Evo 4G LTE, Sprint's prepaid service Virgin Mobile re-released the Evo 3D as the Evo V 4G, as its first phone to use Sprint's WiMAX network. The Evo V 4G is identical to the Evo 3D, except that it ships with Android 4.0.3 and the Sense 3.6 interface instead of Sense 3.0 and Android 2.3. The new software also became available for the Evo 3D on Sprint as an update.
