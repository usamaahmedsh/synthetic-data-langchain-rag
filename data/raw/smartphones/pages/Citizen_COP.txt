=== Help Me (SOS) ===
This function lets the user send a SOS message for instant Help in emergency situations. The user needs to save up to four trusted contacts, who can be alerted through a SOS message sent via the App in case of emergency. On clicking 'Help Me' button, the application sends an auto generated message along with the real-time GEO location of the user. It also reports the same information to police control room to help them initiate quick action.
