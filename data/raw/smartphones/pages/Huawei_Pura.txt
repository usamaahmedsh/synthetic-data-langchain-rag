The Huawei Pura (formerly the Ascend P series and P series) is a series of high-end and medium-range smartphones produced by Huawei, based on its proprietary HarmonyOS mobile operating system (Android-based prior to US sanctions and trade war in 2019). The P series was formerly marketed as part of Huawei's larger Ascend brand, and some models were called P smart.
Under the company's current hardware release cadence, Pura series phones are typically directed towards mainstream consumers as the company's flagship smartphones, refining and expanding upon technologies introduced in Mate series phablet devices (which are typically positioned towards early adopters). The Pura series has featured a strong emphasis on camera functionality; since 2016, and beginning with the Huawei P9, Huawei has been in a co-engineering partnership with the German optics manufacturer Leica.
On April 15, 2024, Huawei rebranded its P series as the "Pura series", starting with the Pura 70.
