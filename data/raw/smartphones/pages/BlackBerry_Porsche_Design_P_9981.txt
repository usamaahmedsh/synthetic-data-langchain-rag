The BlackBerry Porsche Design P'9981 is a bar-style smartphone developed by Research In Motion and Porsche Design, announced together on October 27, 2011 in Dubai. It was a variant of the latest model of the BlackBerry Bold 9900, sharing all of its internal hardware components. Porsche Design changed the aesthetics of the Bold by adding a metal QWERTY keyboard laid across four straight rows that were set into the steel frame, each row of keys divided by a space, along with custom menu buttons.
It shared, with the BlackBerry Bold 9900, the same Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8655 CPU clocked at 1.2 GHz, 768 MB of RAM, a 2.8-inch (71 mm) TFT multi-touch capacitive touchscreen (built on 88μm pixel) with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels, and the same 5.0-megapixel EDOF rear camera capable of 720p video recording, and an LED flash. The major difference was the exterior case, which included a unibody stainless steel frame and leather rear door.
It runs BlackBerry OS 7 and featured a custom user interface, modified by Porsche Design. Aside from this, the software contained within the device itself is identical to software on the Bold 9900.
