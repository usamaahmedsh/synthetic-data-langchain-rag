The Nokia 9210 Communicator is the third-generation Communicator series mobile phone produced by Nokia, announced on 21 November 2000 and released in June 2001. It greatly improved on the second-generation Nokia 9110 Communicator, providing a colour main screen and using an ARM processor. It is one of the few mobile phones able to send and receive fax.
It was the first device to run on the Symbian OS platform, version 6, succeeding version 5 of EPOC. It also introduced Nokia's Series 80 interface, which was the result of Symbian Ltd.'s 'Crystal' design.
It is used as a normal though bulky mobile phone in closed mode; when it is flipped open it can be used like a very small notebook computer with a 640 × 200 screen. The earpiece and microphone are located on the back so one must hold it with the front screen and keypad facing out to make a call. The phone also has speakerphone functionality.
The 9210 Communicator's success helped Nokia overtake both Palm and Compaq to become the leading 'mobile data device' vendor in Western Europe in the third quarter of 2001, when it had a 28.3 percent share in the market.

== Replacement models ==
Nokia replaced the 9210 in first quarter of 2005 with:

Nokia 9500 – has additional features (Wi-Fi and camera) but is smaller 148 mm × 57 mm × 24 mm) and lighter (222 g), and has an updated Symbian Series 80 operating system.
Nokia 9300 – is smaller (132 mm × 51 mm × 21 mm) and lighter (167 g) than Nokia 9210, with similar features and the same operating system as the Nokia 9500.
Both new models include other improvements such as: EDGE, colour external displays and Bluetooth.


== Legacy ==
The phone received a resurgence in interest in the 2010s when it was pointed out that a scene in the music video for "Dilemma" by Nelly featuring Kelly Rowland shows Rowland's character typing a text message in her Nokia 9210 using a spreadsheet application. Nelly naively defended the use of the application in an interview with Australian talk show The Project in November 2016, explaining that it was used during the time despite eventually becoming outdated. In subsequent interviews, Rowland admitted to not knowing what Microsoft Excel was, which elicited a response from the application's official Twitter account.
