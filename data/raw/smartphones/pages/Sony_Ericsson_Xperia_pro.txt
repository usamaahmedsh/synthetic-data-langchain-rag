The Sony Ericsson Xperia pro is an Android smartphone from Sony Ericsson which was launched in October 2011. The Xperia Pro has a 3.7-inch (94 mm) capacitive touch-screen, slider keyboard, smart phone with mobile BRAVIA engine which optimises the picture and runs at a resolution of 854×480 pixels, a 1 GHz Snapdragon processor, an 8.1 mega-pixel camera, a dedicated Two-step camera key, USB host port, HDMI-out, 512 MB of onboard RAM, and an 8 GB microSD card (expandable up to 32 GB with Android 2.3; up to 256 GB with Android 4.04). The Sony Ericsson Xperia Pro is available in black, silver, or red.


== Overview ==
The Xperia Pro comes pre-installed with the Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) operating system. As of June 2012, Sony Xperia Pro users can upgrade their phone through Sony Update to Android 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich).
A number of users have, after upgrading to Android 4.0.x Ice Cream Sandwich, encountered a problem with the QWERTY physical keyboard being changed to AZERTY format and vice versa. This issue has been resolved as of 1 September 2012.
It has one front-facing camera, one rear camera with flash, and a back-lit, sliding, qwerty keyboard – just like other Xperia pro variants.
The display features a Sony Mobile BRAVIA Engine which allows users to view pictures and video on the 3.7" Reality display.
It also features an Exmor R sensor that allows for the capture of high definition movies and stills in low lit areas, which can then be shown in HD on a TV via the HDMI connector.


== Reception ==
The Xperia Pro was first revealed on 13 February 2011, a day before MWC 2011, along with Xperia Play and Xperia Neo.
