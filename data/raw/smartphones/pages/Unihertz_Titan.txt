The Unihertz Titan is a family of rugged smartphones with physical QWERTY keyboards produced by the Chinese company Unihertz. The series began in July 2019 as a crowdfunded device and has since been expanded into several models. Although unrelated to BlackBerry devices, the Titan line has drawn interest from some former BlackBerry users after the Canadian company discontinued its own smartphones and server infrastructure in early 2022. Every Titan variant combines a hardware keyboard with either a square or narrow touchscreen and runs the Android operating system.


== History ==
Unihertz unveiled the original Titan through a Kickstarter campaign on 30 July 2019. The technology site PhoneArena reported that the project’s US$100,000 funding goal was met within minutes and that early backers were promised delivery by December 2019. The handset weighed about 303 g, measured almost 17 mm thick and paired an “ergonomically designed” keyboard with a 4.5‑inch 1:1 display (1,400 × 1,400 pixels). The Next Web described the prototype as using a MediaTek Helio P60 system‑on‑chip, 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, shipping with Android 9.0, and including a 6,000 mAh battery, USB‑C port and IP67 dust/water resistance.
In 2021 Unihertz introduced the Titan Pocket, a smaller handset with a 3.1‑inch 716 × 720 display and the same Helio P70 processor. Forbes characterised it as a “throwback” measuring 5.22 × 2.88 × 0.66 inches (133 × 73 × 17 mm) and weighing 215 g, with 6 GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage, a 4,000 mAh battery and microSD expansion. The phone shipped with Android 11 and its keyboard offered trackpad-like scrolling as well as a programmable red side button. Reviewers praised its productivity features but found the small screen awkward for multimedia viewing.
A thinner variant, the Titan Slim, launched via Kickstarter in May 2022. Android Police reported that the Slim uses a MediaTek Helio P70 SoC with 6 GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal storage (without microSD), features a 4.2‑inch 768 × 1,280 LCD and a four‑row keyboard with an integrated fingerprint sensor, and runs Android 11. It includes a 48 MP rear camera, 8 MP front camera, dual‑SIM capability and a 4,100 mAh battery with 10 W charging, and weighs 204 g. Critics appreciated its protective accessories but criticised its small screen, lack of 5G support and outdated software.
The Titan 2 was announced in 2025 as Unihertz’s first 5G keyboard phone. TechRadar reported that the Titan 2 features a 4.5‑inch 1:1 display (1,440 × 1,440 pixels) supplemented by a 2‑inch rear display, dual programmable side buttons and a redesigned keyboard with capacitive gestures. Powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor, the handset includes 12 GB of LPDDR5 RAM, 512 GB of UFS 3.1 storage, a 5,050 mAh battery with 33 W charging and dual nano‑SIM support. The camera array comprises a 50 MP main sensor, 8 MP telephoto lens and 32 MP front camera. Android Police reported that the phone weighs 235 g, measures 137.8 × 88.7 × 10.8 mm and will ship with Android 15 to Kickstarter backers in October 2025, calling it “the best keyboard phone since the demise of BlackBerry”.
