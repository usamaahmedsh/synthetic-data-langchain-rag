The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the sixteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks. The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022, and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16. Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022. Along with the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are the last iPhones to feature the Lightning port, as their successors, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus (announced on September 12, 2023), use a USB-C port, per European Commission regulation.
The iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13. Instead, Apple returned to a larger model with the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple had not introduced a "Plus" model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. Both iPhone 14 models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro models) sold in the United States, ended support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 not to come with a discrete SIM card reader, requiring activation by way of eSIM.
To comply with mandates, the iPhone 14 models, along with the iPhone SE (third generation), were discontinued in the European Union in 2024, completing the iPhone's transition from a Lightning connection to USB-C. The iPhone 14 models alongside the iPhone SE (third generation) were later discontinued worldwide on February 19, 2025, following the unveil of the iPhone 16e.


== History ==
The iPhone 14 was originally rumored to come with 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch display size options. However, when the iPhone 14 was unveiled, no smaller display option was available. This may have been due to underwhelming sales of the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini. Instead, a larger 6.7-inch display size option was added to the lower-priced iPhone 14 lineup. The new 6.7-inch variant of the iPhone 14 was named "iPhone 14 Plus", rather than "iPhone 14 Max", which was predicted by previous rumors.
The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus were officially announced at Apple's "Far Out" event, along with the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), Apple Watch Ultra, AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and an update to Apple Fitness+ via a virtual press conference filmed at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022.
Apple started taking pre-orders on September 9, with general availability from September 16 for the iPhone 14 and October 7 for the iPhone 14 Plus.


== Design ==

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have an identical design to the iPhone 13, although the US models do not have a physical SIM tray.
The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and Product Red. Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. The yellow color option was added on March 7, 2023.
The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, along with the iPhone SE (3rd generation) are the final iPhone models to feature the Product Red color option.


== Hardware ==
iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in three internal storage configurations: 128, 256, and 512 GB. Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the previous iPhone 13 and 13 mini models' 4 GB of RAM. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same IP68 rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.


=== Chipset ===
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a 5-nanometer Apple-designed SOC, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have a newer A16 Bionic.
The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is identical to the A15 in the previous year's iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max, which has more memory (6 GB RAM) and an additional GPU core compared to the A15 in the non-Pro iPhone 13 models (4 GB RAM).
The iPhone 14 was the first flagship model since the 2008 iPhone 3G to have a chip that was unchanged from the previous year. The Verge's Mitchell Clark attributed the unchanged chip to an attempt to maintain costs during the ongoing chip shortage and inflation surge. Clark also said the A15 "still outperforms the latest chips from Qualcomm and Google in most benchmarks", though the older chip may lead to the iPhone 14 receiving fewer updates, similar to what happened with the iPhone 5c from 2013.


=== Display ===
The iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 14 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2778 × 1284 pixels and a pixel density of around 458 PPI. Both models have typical brightness of up to 800 nits, and a max brightness of up to 1200 nits.


=== Cameras ===
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature the same dual-cameras system: one front-facing camera (12MP f/1.9), and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.5) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera, with the wide and front-facing cameras having a faster aperture than the iPhone 13. The front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.
The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.
The camera app contains Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at 30 fps and 60 fps.
An "Action mode" feature was added to extend the electrical video stabilization. When activated, a smaller crop of the image sensor is read out for video recording. While reducing the field of view, a wider area around it can be used as buffer against shakes. The area read out from the image sensor is moved between frames to counteract hand movements.


=== Battery ===
The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13. According to Apple, the iPhone 14 (3,279 mAh) can provide up to 20 hours of video playback, 16 hours of streaming video playback, and 80 hours of audio playback. Its predecessor, the iPhone 13 (3,240 mAh), is rated for up to 19 hours of video playback, 15 hours of streaming video playback, and 75 hours of audio playback. The larger iPhone 14 Plus (4,325 mAh) variant provides up to 26 hours of video playback.


== Software ==

The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus originally shipped with iOS 16. The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard was added to the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus with the update to iOS 17.2. The latest version of iOS, iOS 26 is compatible with the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.


== Specifications ==


== Satellite connectivity ==
Apple's new Emergency SOS via satellite service for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models uses the spectrum in L and S bands designated for mobile satellite services by ITU Radio Regulations. When an iPhone user makes an Emergency SOS via satellite request, the message is received by an orbiting satellite operated by Globalstar. The satellite then sends the message down to ground stations located across the globe.
As of November 2022, Globalstar operates a constellation of 25 satellites in low Earth orbit, with plans to enhance this in the future via its partnership with Apple.
The service became available to US and Canada on November 15, 2022, and to the UK, Germany, Ireland, and France on December 13, 2022. From May 15, 2023, the service became available in Australia and New Zealand. However, it is not the first mobile phone to combine both cellular and satellite connectivity.


== Criticism ==


=== Crash Detection false positives ===

Crash Detection is a feature built into the iPhone 14 that is designed to detect severe car crashes and automatically initiates an emergency phone call 20 seconds after it is detected unless the user cancels it. Since its release, there have been many reports saying that the feature was automatically turned on during rollercoaster rides, due to the fact that the rides suddenly stop after going at high speeds, as happens in a car crash.
Emergency dispatchers have received many false alarm calls from iPhone 14 and Apple Watch users who have been skiing safely. In Colorado, a wave of false 9-1-1 calls led Aspen Mountain to advise device owners to upgrade their operating systems or disable the feature. In Japan's Hida Mountains, emergency dispatchers reported 134 false emergency calls, more than 14% of the total emergency call volume, between December 16, 2022, and January 23, 2023, attributed to Crash Detection triggering while an iPhone 14 owner was skiing.


=== Repairability ===
While the iPhone 14 was originally lauded for its innovative new hardware design and recommended by iFixit, concerns over software limitations on parts not authorized by Apple caused iFixit to decrease their evaluation to a 4/10 or "not recommended" in September 2023.
