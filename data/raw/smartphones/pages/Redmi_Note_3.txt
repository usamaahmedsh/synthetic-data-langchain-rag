The Snapdragon variants are powered by the Snapdragon 650 system-on-chip with a hexa-core CPU consisting of a high performance cluster with 2x 1.8 GHz ARM Cortex-A72 cores and a high efficiency cluster with 4x 1.6 GHz ARM Cortex-A53 cores, and an Adreno 510 GPU. The phone comes with 2 GB or 3 GB of RAM and 16 GB or 32 GB of eMMC 5.0 internal flash storage.
Another notable difference between the MediaTek and Qualcomm variants of the phone is the rear-facing camera; there is a 13 MP camera sensor on the MediaTek variant whereas this is upgraded to a 16 MP sensor on the Qualcomm variants. There is also a 5 MP front-facing camera on all variants.
All variants of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 include a 5.5 in (140 mm) 1080p display with 1080x1920 pixels resolution and 403 ppi pixel density. The Snapdragon variants use a special display technology known as 'Sunlight Display' in which the phone detects the ambient light and makes pixel-level adjustments in order to improve legibility under the sunlight. The phone also features a blue light filter for low light (night) reading.
Another notable feature of the phone is the presence of a fingerprint sensor at the back. It can also be used for taking photos via the front-facing or rear-facing camera. The phone has a 4050 mAh Li-Po non-removable battery.


==== Connectivity ====
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 has Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, thus supporting both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The MediaTek variant supports two SIM cards while the Snapdragon variants have a SIM card and a microSDHC/SIM card hybrid slot; the microSDHC slot can also be used as a secondary SIM card slot.


=== Software ===
The Snapdragon variant (kenzo) runs on an Android based MIUI 7 OS which was updated to MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0 and then to MIUI 10. Many custom Android ROMs are available for this device; notable examples are MIUI 9 based on Android 7.0, CyanogenMod 13 and 14 (based on Android Marshmallow and Nougat, respectively), Lineage OS 13, 14, 15, Resurrection Remix OS 8.6 (based on Android 10) and an unstable port of Sailfish OS.

The Redmi Note 3 Special Edition (kate) came with MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0 which can be updated to MIUI 10.
Although both of the Snapdragon-based variants (kenzo and kate) are similar with their ROMs, their firmware aren't compatible with each other and installing the wrong one may brick the device.
