The HTC Inspire 4G is the first smartphone available on AT&T Mobility branded as "4G". It was first announced at CES in January 2011 and was released in February 2011. The Inspire 4G is a variant of the HTC Desire HD that was sold in Europe so the Inspire has the same design and similar specifications except that the Inspire supports AT&T's HSPA+ 4G network.


== Hardware ==
The Inspire features a 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and an 8 MP camera and dual LED flash, in-camera editing, live picture effects, and a 720p camcorder to capture HD video. It has a 4.3-inch class (480×800) WVGA (16M Colors) TFT capacitive touchscreen covered by Gorilla Glass, a special crack and scratch resistant material made by Corning with multi-touch input support.
The HTC Inspire 4G has 768 MB RAM and 4 GB of internal flash memory data storage. There is also a single microSDHC slot, which can accept a microSDHC card with a capacity of up to 32 GB of data storage.


== Software ==
The Inspire launched with Android 2.2.1 Froyo with the custom HTC Sense 2.0 skin as the user interface. The OS was later updated on 8 August 2011 to Android 2.3.3 with Sense 2.1 and again on 31 July 2012 to Android 2.3.5 with Sense 3.0.
In May 2011, AT&T issued an update allowing unknown sources to be installed, which allows users to sideload applications. On 25 July 2011 AT&T issued Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread, HTC Sense 2.1, and various fixes to the phone.
On 31 July 2012 HTC released software update 3.20.502.52 OTA. New features included: Android 2.3.5, HTC Sense 3.0, Task Manager, and AT&T Address Book. Fixes/Updates included: Call optimization improvements, improved security functionality, SMS/MMS contact display fix, background data use improvement, and slightly longer battery life. This was the last official update for the phone's operating system. In March 2013, AT&T issued a security update for various HTC and carrier applications used in the previous software update.
In the xda-developers forum, user software is available for the device with Android 4.4.4 via Cyanogenmod 11.


== HSUPA issues ==
Original specs pointed out the existence of HSUPA to enhance the upload speeds under the 3G network, but as early adopters inquired about slow upload connections, AT&T replied that the Inspire 4G is not HSUPA capable. However, the Inspire 4G is fully capable of HSUPA, but it was disabled by AT&T for unknown reasons. By 30 April 2011 AT&T issued an over the air (OTA) update enabling HSUPA for the HTC Inspire 4G.
