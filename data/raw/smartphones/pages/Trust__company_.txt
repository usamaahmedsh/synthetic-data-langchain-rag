== Sports sponsorship ==
Dutch F1 driver Jos Verstappen used his strong Dutch links to gain sponsorship for the Minardi F1 Team in 2003 when Trust became one of the team sponsors.
That sponsorship was moved to Jordan Grand Prix in 2004 when Verstappen was on the verge of a race seat with the team. Trust had a sponsorship agreement with Spyker F1 as the team started to bring in Dutch sponsorship. Trust was the head sponsor of the Arden International team, which competed in the GP2 and GP2 Asia series, and previously in Formula 3000. Because of the sponsorship, the team has been dubbed Trust Team Arden.
Trust also sponsored Minardi Team USA in the 2007 Champ Car World Series for much of the season but ended their sponsorship at the end of the season after the team stopped competing at the end of the year due to the unification of Champ Car and Indycar. Trust sponsored Red Bull Racing in 2009, both Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber had the Trust name visible on the chin bar of their helmets.
