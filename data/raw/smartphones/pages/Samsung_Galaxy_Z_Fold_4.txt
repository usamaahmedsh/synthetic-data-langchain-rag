The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 (stylized as Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4, sold as Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 in certain territories) is a foldable smartphone that is part of the Samsung Galaxy Z series. It was announced at the August 2022 edition of Galaxy Unpacked alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 4. It was released subsequently on August 25, 2022, as the successor to the Galaxy Z Fold 3.


== Specifications ==


=== Design ===
The Z Fold 4's outer display and back panel use Gorilla Glass Victus+, whilst the foldable inner display is made of Samsung's proprietary "Ultra-Thin Glass" with two protective PET plastic layers covering it, the top of which is a replaceable screen protector.
The Z Fold 4 has an IPX8 ingress protection rating for water resistance, with dust resistance not being rated. The outer frame is constructed from aluminum, marketed as 'Armor Frame' by Samsung.
The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 is available in four colors: Phantom Black, Beige, Graygreen and Burgundy.


=== Hardware ===
The Galaxy Z Fold 4 has two screens: its 6.2-inch external cover display and its foldable 7.6-inch inner display featuring support for the S Pen Pro and the S Pen Fold Edition, with both running at 120 Hz and including support for variable refresh rate to help maximize power efficiency. 
Compared to the prior generation Z Fold 3, the inner display now has a slightly more square aspect ratio (~6:5 vs ~5:4) due to the external cover display being made moderately wider by about +3 mm; along with both it and the actual phone itself being made ever so slightly shorter. Both of these changes end up combining for a notably wider and thus closer to "traditional phone shaped" ~23.1:9 aspect ratio on the external cover display when it's folded, as compared to the Fold 3's notably narrower ~24.5:9.
The device has 12 GB of RAM, and either 256 GB, 512 GB or 1 TB of UFS 3.1 flash storage, with no support for expanding the device's storage capacity via micro-SD cards.
The Z Fold 4 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1.
The device's included battery is a 4400 mAh dual-cell unit that fast charges via USB-C up to 25 W, or via wireless charging up to 15 W. 
The Z Fold 4 features three rear cameras, including a 50 MP wide-angle camera, a 12 MP ultra-wide camera, and a 10 MP telephoto camera. The wide camera shares its sensor with the S22 and S22+, replacing the previous 12 MP sensor, and the telephoto camera has been upgraded from 2x to 3x optical zoom. It has two front-facing cameras, with a 10 MP camera on the cover display and a 4 MP under-display camera on the right half of the inner display, which now has a less visibly apparent display covering with almost double the pixel density of the previous model.


=== Software ===
The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 ships with Android 12L based One UI 4.1.1. They enabled a couple of new “Labs” features for multi-window fans. With these new options enabled, users can now swipe the corner of an app inward to enable Pop-Up View. They can also swipe from the edges of the screen using two fingers to enable multi-window mode on the fly. Samsung has promised 4 Android OS upgrades (till Android 16) and 5 years of security updates (till 2027). One UI 5.0 was released on 7 November 2022. Even the Galaxy Z Fold 4 is getting the stable Android 13 update in the country with firmware version F936NKSU1BVK5. These new updates also bring the November 2022 security patch to the devices to fix close to four dozen security vulnerabilities.
The One UI 6 update based on Android 14 began rolling out to all Z Fold 4 devices on 16 December 2023. This was later followed by One UI 6.1, which mainly includes new AI-based features that are exclusive to this and later generations of the Galaxy Z series.
The One UI 7 update based on Android 15 began rolling out to all Z Fold 4 devices on 2 May 2025.
