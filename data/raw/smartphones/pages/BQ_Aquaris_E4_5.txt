The BQ Aquaris E4.5 is an Android smartphone from the Spanish manufacturer BQ that was released to market in June 2014 as a budget dual-SIM phone. The device shipped with Android versions starting from v4.0 and can be updated to Android 4.4.2 (KitKat). BQ elected not to skin the operating system and as such it retains the unmodified "Google Experience".


== Ubuntu Edition ==
The Aquaris E4.5 is notable for being the first commercially available phone to carry the Ubuntu Touch mobile operating system.
On 9 February 2015, BQ in partnership with Canonical launched the BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition and it began a gradual release in the European Union through a series of online flash sales.
BQ would later follow a similar pattern with the Aquaris E5, releasing it first with Android and then with Ubuntu Touch.
