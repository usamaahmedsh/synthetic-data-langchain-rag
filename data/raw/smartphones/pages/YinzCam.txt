In July 2009, Pittsburgh City Councilman Bill Peduto, with the support of Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, announced their intention for the city of Pittsburgh to become the most tech-friendly city in the United States. A number of Pittsburgh technology firms and personalities were present at the announcement, including Priya Narasimhan. By August 2009, YinzCam had produced iBurgh, an iPhone application to allow citizens to report complaints to the city's departments via smartphone. The app sends complaints, coupled with photos and Global Positioning System data to city departments. It was the first iPhone application to permit such complaints to municipal authorities.
In February 2010, YinzCam developed a follow-up program, CityZenMobile, to allow crowd-sourcing of road conditions. It was released amid the February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard that left much of Pittsburgh impassable.
