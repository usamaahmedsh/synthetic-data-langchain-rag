== History ==
Hopin was founded in 2020 by Johnny Boufarhat. Its platform allowed meeting participants for conference attending and networking online, exchange virtual business cards, and get a summary of their connections after an event. It become increasingly popular in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Hopin raised over $1 billion in funding from various investors, including Accel, IVP, Coatue Management, Northzone, Salesforce Ventures, and others. Its peak valuation was $7.8 billion in August 2021. 
The company made several rounds of layoffs in 2022 as demand for online events shrank and in-person events resumed.
In August 2023, following a share buyback for shareholders of over $500M+, the company sold its events unit assets—including its technology, customers and engineering and product teams—to RingCentral for $15–50 million. Boufarat stepped down as CEO. The company continued to operate its live-streaming and video hosting products Streamyard and Streamable. The company's valuation was approximately $400 million.
In February 2024, Hopin moved its headquarters to the United States and closed its UK Corporate entity. Hopin was acquired by Bending Spoons in April 2024.
