The Moto G is an Android smartphone developed and manufactured by Motorola Mobility, at the time a subsidiary of Google. Released on 13 November 2013, the phone was initially aimed at emerging markets, although it was also available in developed markets as a low-price option.
After six months on the market, the Moto G became Motorola's best-selling smartphone ever, and was the top selling phone in Mexico and Brazil.
The Moto G was succeeded by the second generation Moto G in September 2014.


== Specifications ==
The phone features a 4.5 inch LCD IPS screen and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor clocked at 1.2 GHz, paired with the Adreno 305 GPU running at 450 MHz clock speed. The original operating system was Android 4.3 "Jelly Bean", with later updates to 5.1 "Lollipop".
The phone is closely related to the Moto X that was released three months prior and look similar, although there are some key differences. The Moto G is not able to have active notifications, quick capture, and touchless control like the Moto X due to the Moto X using a special processor that would be cost-prohibitive for the Moto G. In addition, the Moto G has a removable back cover so that users can customize the phone, instead of the Moto X's sealed back that is held on with an adhesive.
The original Moto G did not use the LTE network because the standard had not been adopted in emerging markets at that time. On 13 May 2014, Motorola unveiled an updated variant of the phone, the Moto G LTE, which added LTE capability, a gyroscope, and a MicroSD card slot. By January 2015 the Android 5.0.2 "Lollipop" OTA update started rolling out and in September 2015, version 5.1 rolled out in India. As of March 2015, Motorola has been slowly upgrading handsets. Motorola started releasing the 5.1 update for Google Play Edition on April 2, 2015. In the United Kingdom, the 5.1 update started on June 12, 2015.
