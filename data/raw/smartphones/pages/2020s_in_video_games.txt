The 2020s is the sixth decade in the industry's history. The industry remains heavily dominated by the actions of Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, but it remains unforeseen how their dominance will be affected by cloud gaming and the smartphone and tablet market. Virtual reality headsets are expected to become more popular over the course of the decade. The industry was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ninth generation of video game consoles went on sale, beginning with the Xbox Series X and Series S and the PlayStation 5. Notable games released in the 2020s included Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Doom Eternal, Final Fantasy VII Remake, The Last of Us Part II, Ghost of Tsushima, Fall Guys, Hades, Genshin Impact, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Cyberpunk 2077, It Takes Two, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Resident Evil Village, Metroid Dread, Valorant, Forza Horizon 5, Horizon Forbidden West, Elden Ring, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Stray, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Cult of the Lamb, God of War Ragnarök, Sonic Frontiers, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Hi-Fi Rush, Resident Evil 4 (2023), The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Mortal Kombat 1, Street Fighter 6, Baldur's Gate 3, Starfield, Super Mario Bros.

== Consoles of the 2020s ==


=== Eighth generation consoles (2012–present) ===

The eighth generation of video game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, remain in widespread use. Cloud gaming services like Google Stadia and Amazon Luna are also part of the eighth generation. The Xbox One and Nintendo 3DS were both discontinued in 2020 with the Stadia also shutting down in 2023.


=== Ninth generation consoles (2020–present) ===

The ninth generation of video game consoles has begun in the 2020s, with the release of the Xbox Series X and Series S and PlayStation 5 in 2020. The ninth generation offers faster computation and graphics processors, support for real-time ray tracing graphics, output for 4K resolution, and in some cases, 8K resolution, with rendering speeds targeting 60 frames per second (fps) or higher. Internally, both console families introduced new internal solid-state drive (SSD) systems to be used as high-throughput memory and storage systems for games to reduce or eliminate loading times and support in-game streaming. Standalone virtual reality headsets have also emerged with new entries in the Meta Quest line, HTC Vive XR Elite, and Apple Vision Pro all being introduced in the decade. The Nintendo Switch 2, a successor to the Switch, was released in most territories on June 5, 2025.


== History ==

At the beginning of decade many events were severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 through 2022. One early example in 2020 was the cancellation of that year's edition of E3. Summer Game Fest would emerge as a successor to E3, as the brand was retired in 2023. Competitive gaming continued to gain mainstream appeal in the decade as the IOC announced the creation of the Olympic Esports Games and Saudi Arabia held the 2024 Esports World Cup. There were setbacks however, as both the Overwatch League and MLG ceased operations.


=== 2020 ===

The COVID-19 pandemic—which saw rapid spread in 2020—significantly impacted the video game industry. Most video game development studios shifted to remote work in order to continue production through pandemic lockdowns. Many games were delayed as a result of changed working conditions, though delays increased in the years following. The lockdowns also caused increased interest and participation in online gaming, player spending on microtransactions, viewership of video game live streaming, a general spike in video game sales, and served as an introduction to video games as a whole for many. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended video games as both a distraction from the pandemic and a method to connect with friends and family while practicing social distancing, and roughly half of those who play video games reported increased playtime during the pandemic and considered the activity a source of stress relief and distraction. Games such as Animal Crossing: New Horizons were praised for offering an "escape" from the pandemic, and the rises in popularity for games such as Among Us were credited to the pandemic shutdowns.
