== Reception ==
Overall, initial reviews of the Honor 9 were positive, averaging 8.8 out of 10. Android Authority's Gary Sims gave the phone a rating of 8.7 out of 10, and wrote in his review summary: "The Honor 9 certainly ticks a lot of the right boxes: great performance, dual cameras, sleek design, and an IR blaster! The only downsides are the lack of toughened glass over the display and the slippery nature of the build materials." Andy Boxall of Digital Trends wrote the following as a summary of his review: "The Honor 9 impresses so much, it's a strong contender for one of the best reasonably priced smartphones available." PC Magazine's Thomas Newton assigned the Honor 9 a rating of 4 out of 5, meaning "excellent". Swedroid offered its recommendation and rated the phone 8.3 out of 10 overall.
Jessica Murgia of AndroidPit, Dominic Preston of TechAdvisors, James Peckham of TechRadar, and ZDNet's Sandra Vogel each rated the phone 4.5 out of 5. Preston's summary read, "The Honor 9 is an undeniably impressive phone for an unmatched price right now. In performance terms, it's nipping at the heels of the year's top flagships, and only lacking flashy features like waterproofing or a bezel-less screen. It looks great, it runs fast, and it costs less than £400. We're sold." Summarizing his review, Peckham wrote, "The Honor 9 offers a lot of what the high-end flagship phones do right now, but for a much lower price. There's no exciting, headline-grabbing feature here, but a great design, fantastic performance and lots of nice touches make this an all-round impressive and affordable phone." Vogel also gave a rating of 8.9 on a 10-point scale, meaning "outstanding".
Android Central's Alex Dobie called the Honor 9 the "best phone for less than £400". He gave the phone the "Choice Award" and wrote, "The Honor 9 isn't perfect, but it is a great all-rounder that makes high-end performance and design more affordable than ever before." Stuff rated the Honor 9 five out of five stars and said, "High-end hardware at a middleweight price makes the Honor 9 one of the best phone deals around." TechRadar recommend the Honor 9, which won in the "Best Mid-range Phone" category at the 2017 T3 Awards.
