LG K10 (2017) has a redesigned form factor with a rear-mounted power button/fingerprint sensor, though it has a similar 5.3" 720p display with the previous incarnation and different internal hardware variants depending on the region. The M257 version, sold by Cricket Wireless has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 system-on-chip with a 1.4 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU and an Adreno 308 GPU; other models use the MediaTek MT6750 system-on-chip with an octa-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU comprising a four-core cluster clocked at 1.5 GHz and another four-core cluster clocked at 1.0 GHz and an ARM Mali-T860 MP2 GPU. All models have 2 GB of RAM.
LG K10 (2017) model has 16 GB of internal storage with 9 GB of usable space; the internal storage is expandable up to 2 TB using a microSD card. It has a 2800 mAh battery, compared to the predecessor's 2100 mAh battery. Some models have a fingerprint sensor embedded on the power button at the rear, NFC, and/or dual-SIM.


=== Software ===
LG K10 (2017) runs on Google's Android 7.0 Nougat with LG's user interface. The software supports knock-on gesture, allowing to unlock the phone by tapping on the display. In 2018, it has received Android 8.1.0 Oreo update in India.
The built-in panic button is a key selling point in South Asia, in response to Indian legislation requiring mobile phones sold in the country to have an alarm feature built in following controversy over incidents such as the 2012 Delhi gang rape.
