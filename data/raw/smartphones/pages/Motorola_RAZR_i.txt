The Motorola RAZR i (XT890) is a smartphone designed by Motorola Mobility. It was officially announced on 18 September 2012 in London, UK.
The RAZR i is the first smartphone by Motorola to feature an Intel Atom "Medfield" processor/SOC of the x86/IA-32 architecture, running a x86 port of the Android operating system. It is also the first smartphone with a CPU clocked at 2.0 GHz in its stock configuration. Externally, it looks identical to its sibling Motorola RAZR M launched two weeks earlier in the US, with which it also shares many of its specs. The RAZR i is an almost identical edition except it has an Intel Atom Z2460 processor., which gives it more processing power and imaging power; although it lacks LTE support. Initially it was reported that it does not fully support many high-end apps and games designed for ARM processors until these apps or games are ported and recompiled for Intel compatibility. However, Intel developed a binary emulator called Houdini that is present on the RAZR i, to allow ARM code to run on x86 architecture. A test showed that the RAZR i was able to run most ARM Android apps thanks to the background emulation, but that a few apps would still not function.
A special China-only version of the smartphone, the RAZR i MT788 was announced in November, 2012.
The GPU in the RAZR i's Intel Atom Z2460 processor is a PowerVR SGX540, a faster-clocked version of the same GPU as in the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and many older smartphones such as the original Samsung Galaxy S. While the RAZR i's raw CPU processing power can be excellent for tasks such as web browsing, its GPU can be considerably slower than the RAZR M, which uses a Snapdragon S4 CPU featuring an Adreno 225 GPU. This may be alleviated somewhat by the Atom Z2460 being capable of providing much greater memory bandwidth, which has traditionally been a severe performance-constraining factor in ARM-based chips.
Despite being the first product from a "multi-year, multi-device" partnership between Motorola and Intel, no other Intel-powered Motorola smartphone was ever released afterwards.
