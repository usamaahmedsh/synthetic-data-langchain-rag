=== Push to Talk Plus (PoC+) ===
Push to Talk Plus, also known as PoC+, is an application that uses a method of conversing on half-duplex communication lines, including two-way radio, using a momentary button to switch from voice reception mode to transmit mode. It uses a service option for a cellular phone network which permits subscribers to use their phone as a walkie-talkie with unlimited range. One significant advantage of PoC+ is that it allows a single person to reach an active talk group with a single button press; users need not make several calls to coordinate with a group.


=== Smartface Platform ===
Smartface Platform is drag-and-drop cross-platform mobile application development and management tool and first released in 2006. Smartface Designer, the component of Smartface Platform enables visual development of mobile applications with drag-and-drop actions and interactive wizards.
