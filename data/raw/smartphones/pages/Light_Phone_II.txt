The Light Phone II is a minimalist mobile phone developed by Light
, a Brooklyn-based startup known for designing technology “to be used as little as possible.” It is the successor to the original 2017 Light Phone (1st generation), offering a few more features while maintaining a stripped-down philosophy. The Light Phone III is the successor to the Light Phone II, adding cameras, a fingerprint sensor, and an AMOLED screen. The Light Phone II features a matte black or light gray design with a 2.84-inch monochrome E Ink touchscreen and no cameras, and it includes a 3.5 mm headphone jack for audio. Unlike modern smartphones, it deliberately omits an application store, web browser, email client, or social media apps. At launch, the phone’s only built-in tools were calling, texting, and an alarm clock. The device is intended as an alternative or companion for those seeking a digital detox from full-featured smartphones.
The Light Phone II is a 4G LTE-capable device that was first announced in March 2018 and developed through a crowdfunding campaign. It was positioned as a stand-alone “anti-smartphone,” unlike the credit-card-sized Light Phone (1st Gen), which served only as a secondary phone for calls. Light launched the Light Phone II via an Indiegogo campaign that raised over $3.5 million from backers by 2019. After some delays and design adjustments during development, the first Light Phone II units began shipping to backers in September 2019, with general sales at a launch price of about $350. As with its predecessor, the device is marketed as a “phone away from phone” or minimalist daily driver—providing only essential functions and encouraging users to reduce screen time and constant digital engagement.


== History ==
The Light Phone II’s development was funded through an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign launched in early 2018. The campaign was highly successful: Light reached $600,000 in contributions within the first 10 hours and went on to raise over $3.5 million from more than 10,000 backers.
This strong response, along with $8.4 million in seed investments from firms like Foxconn and notable angel investors, signaled significant interest in a feature phone that could liberate users from smartphone addiction.
Originally, the company aimed to ship the Light Phone II by April 2019, but the complexity of developing new hardware and software forced several delays. Light shared regular progress updates with backers, and at one point had to revise the design: early prototypes in mid-2018 revealed that the E Ink display’s color did not match the casing, and that certain promises (like an aluminium body and USB-C port) were impractical for the final device.
The production model ended up using a sturdy plastic chassis instead of aluminum and a Micro-USB charging port, and it also had a slightly thicker profile to accommodate a larger battery for adequate life. Some backers expressed disappointment at these changes during development, although many remained supportive of the company’s transparency during the process.


== Design and features ==
The Light Phone II has a black-and-white E Ink Carta display, measuring 2.84 inches diagonally. Its matte plastic casing and compact form factor reflect its low-profile aesthetic. The phone weighs 78g and charges via a Micro-USB port.
Its interface is built around a vertical list of "tools"—such as Phone, Messages, Alarm, and Settings—navigable by touchscreen. Later LightOS updates added features including Notes, Calculator, Music Player (MP3), and a basic navigation tool called “Directions.”
Unlike typical smartphones, the Light Phone II does not support app downloads, web browsing, or email. Its design philosophy centers around digital minimalism and reducing screen time.


== Software ==
The Light Phone II runs LightOS, a proprietary operating system developed by Light, based on Android. It uses a heavily customized interface and blocks access to the Google Play Store and third-party apps.


== Reception ==
Reception of the Light Phone II was mixed. Reviewers praised its concept and aesthetic, but many noted limitations in usability, particularly around slow performance and lack of features. TIME named the Light Phone II one of the 100 Best Inventions of 2019.
Critics praised the Light Phone II’s minimalist concept as a way to curb smartphone overuse, but reviewers noted drawbacks such as a sluggish interface and the difficulty of typing on its small screen.


== Legacy ==
Despite its narrow market appeal, the Light Phone II played a significant role in popularizing the concept of digital minimalism in personal technology. It is frequently cited alongside devices like the Punkt MP02 and Mudita Pure as a leading example of “dumb phones” aimed at reducing digital dependency. Light continued to evolve the platform with the release of the Light Phone III in 2025, adding a camera and faster hardware while retaining the same minimalist ethos.
