SnipSnap is a mobile coupon app founded in Philadelphia. It allows users to photograph a printed coupon to find or create a mobile coupon, which can be redeemed in-store.


== Overview ==
The app scans the text, images, logos, and barcodes within a photograph of a coupon to parse out all of the structured coupon content dynamically. The app uses some of this information to power features such as expiration-date reminders, location-based notifications (utilizing the store name, as well as the location of the phone), and scanable barcodes. 
SnipSnap makes money through both targeted and affiliate offers. Depending on a user’s past habits and SnipSnap’s partnerships, companies, like Babies ‘R Us, can push coupons that look just like any other user-clipped coupon. For every “snip” of one of these coupons that results in an actual purchase, SnipSnap will get a kickback.
Mobile Commerce Daily says SnipSnap also works with retailers to manage location-based and "geo-conquesting" campaigns. The company has also begun promoting coupon content outside its mobile apps, and via third-party social media sites, mobile apps, and ad networks.


== Background ==
SnipSnap, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was founded by Ted Mann in September 2011, after Mann left his job at Gannett to start the company. It was incubated at DreamIt Ventures, a startup accelerator program in Philadelphia. It has investors, including venture capital firm MentorTech Ventures, and Michael G. Rubin (co-founder of GSI Commerce). The company has raised $1.5 million in seed funding. In November 2013, Valpak announced a partnership to syndicate all its coupon content to SnipSnap.
