== Variants ==


=== G7 ===
The G7 carries some of the special features of the Plus, while also being on par with the budget G7 Play in other departments. It features a single small notch on the top of the display for the front-facing camera, this does mean it doesn't carry a front facing flash like the G6 did.


=== G7 Play ===
The G7 Play is the least expensive variant of this generation. It has the widest notch in comparison with the other variants, and this means it is the only one with front facing flash. Moto boasts that it has a 60% performance increase compared to the last generation. In the previous generation, its selling feature was the largest battery capacity, 4000 mAh. However, this has been reduced to 3000 mAh. In contrast with other variants, it runs a 32-bit version of the Android operating system.

=== G7 Plus ===

The Plus has not seen many changes from the previous generation. The largest would be the notch and the lack of a front-facing camera LED flash. It can now also charge at 27 W instead of 15 W using the TurboPower Charger, it has stereo speakers, optical image stabilisation and Bluetooth 5.0, however it also has a reduced battery capacity of 3000 mAh instead of 3200 mAh.


=== G7 Power ===
The last-generation G6 Play had a large battery and less powerful specifications, however the G7 Power took this role. The other three models have a 3000 mAh battery, the Power has 5000 mAh. The other specifications fall between those of the G7 Play and G7.

Some specifications such as wireless technologies and storage will vary between regions. Previously only the Play had its fingerprint scanner on the rear. Due to the larger screen, the fingerprint scanner is now located on the rear of all the phones. Additionally, all G7 variants now have a cutout, or notch, at the top of the screen.
