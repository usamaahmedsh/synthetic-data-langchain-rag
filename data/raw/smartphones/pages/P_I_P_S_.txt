P.I.P.S. is a term (recursive acronym) for Symbian software libraries, and means "P.I.P.S. Is POSIX on Symbian OS". It is intended to help C language programmers in migration of desktop and server middleware, applications to Symbian OS based mobile smartphone devices.


== Software libraries ==
The PIPS software libraries provides C and C++ application programming interfaces in standard C libraries such as

POSIX
libc – The "C Standard Library" with system APIs mapped to Symbian OS APIs for better performance
libm – A mathematical library
libpthread – Implements POSIX-style threading support in terms of the underlying Symbian OS thread support
libdl – Implements POSIX-style dynamic linking which extends the dynamic loading model of Symbian OS
LIBZ
libz
OpenSSL
libcrypt
libcrypto
libssl
GNOME
libglib


== Limitations ==
The P.I.P.S. environment does not support true signalling. Basic signal support is emulated using threads.


== Extensions and successors: Open C and Open C++ ==
Open C and Open C++ are extensions by Nokia of P.I.P.S. In contrast to mere P.I.P.S., they were only for Series 60 phones.


== Naming ==
The name was the result of an internal competition in the Symbian Developer Marketing department, organised by Bruce Carney (Developer Marketing) and Erik Jacobson (Product Manager). The full-stops were inserted by Symbian's Legal department to ensure there were no trademark or copyright infringements.
