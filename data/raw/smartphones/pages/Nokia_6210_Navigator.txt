The Nokia 6210 Navigator is a mobile phone made by Nokia that is a successor to Nokia 6110 Navigator. It was announced on February 11, 2008 and had been available from July 2008. It runs on Symbian OS v9.3 with a S60 3rd Edition FP2 user interface.
The Nokia 6210 Navigator is the third phone in the Navigator series to be released by Nokia. The Nokia 6210 Navigator includes pre-loaded navigation maps with a free navigation license for 6 months. It is also the company's first device with a built-in magnetic compass.
It was succeeded by the Nokia 6710 Navigator.


== Accelerometer ==
The 6210 Navigator includes a built-in accelerometer. This was originally only used for video stabilization and photo orientation (to keep landscape or portrait shots oriented as taken).
Nokia Research Center has allowed an application interface directly to the accelerometer, allowing software to use the data from it. Nokia has released an application to demonstrate this.
Third-party programs have been created, including software that will automatically change the screen orientation when the phone is tilted, programs that simulate the sounds of a Star Wars lightsaber when the phone is waved through the air, allow you to mute the phone by turning it face-down, and many more.
