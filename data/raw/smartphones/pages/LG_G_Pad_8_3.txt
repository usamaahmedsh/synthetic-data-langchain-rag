The LG G Pad 8.3 (also known as LG G Tab 8.3) is an 8.3-inch (21 cm) Android-based tablet computer produced and marketed by LG Electronics. It belongs to the LG G series, and was announced on 4 September 2013 and launched in November 2013. Unlike its predecessor which had an 8.9-inch (23 cm) screen, the G Pad 8.3 has a smaller 8.3-inch (21 cm) screen.
