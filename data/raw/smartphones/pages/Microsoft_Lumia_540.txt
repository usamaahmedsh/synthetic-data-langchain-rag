The Microsoft Lumia 540 is a low-cost smartphone from the Microsoft Lumia family.
Unlike its predecessor, the Lumia 540 is equipped with a 720p display, but otherwise has internal specifications similar to earlier devices in the Lumia 5xx series. It comes pre-installed with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2 (with Lumia Denim firmware), and is upgradable to Windows 10 Mobile.
