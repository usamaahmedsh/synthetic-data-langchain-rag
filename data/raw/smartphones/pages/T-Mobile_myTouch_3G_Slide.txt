The T-Mobile myTouch 3G Slide is a smartphone designed and manufactured by HTC, and sold by T-Mobile USA. HTC's name for the device during development was Espresso. The T-Mobile myTouch 3G Slide was unveiled by T-Mobile USA on May 4, 2010, pre-orders began May 23, 2010 and the device went on sale June 2, 2010.


== Software ==
The 3G Slide was released running Android 2.1. It was announced that the device will be upgradable to version 2.2 ("Froyo"), which will include WiFi sharing and WiFi calls, as well as other features. In early April 2011, HTC released the Android OS 2.2.1 ("Froyo") update file. This update was made in a downloadable client for Windows users only. This new update will include optimizations and native support for the new Adobe Flash Player 10.1. However, the full player will only be available on processors of ARMv7 design and newer. Other new features include myModes, a profile-management feature that can also integrate with location and time info. The device also runs a customized version of HTC Sense called "HTC Sense: Expresso" created by T-Mobile.


=== Genius button ===
"Genius" is a custom voice command and text-to-speech system powered by Dragon Dictation technologies. The button replaces, and is in the location of, the search button previously on the myTouch 3G.


== Hardware ==
The myTouch 3G Slide features a 3.4 inch, 320x480 pixel HVGA-resolution TFT capacitive multi-touch enabled LCD screen. The device is built around a 600 MHz Qualcomm MSM7227 processor which incorporates a built-in GPU.

Powering the device is one standard 1300mAh lithium ion battery.
