Sony Ericsson Xperia Neo is an Android smartphone by Sony Ericsson, superseding the Sony Ericsson Vivaz, released in 2010 and preceding the Sony Xperia P, released in 2012. It was launched in early 2011, although due to supply chain disruptions from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, it was delayed until fall 2011 in most markets. During its development it was codenamed Hallon.


== Hardware ==
The Xperia Neo has many of the same features found in the Xperia Arc and the Xperia Play including the mobile Sony Bravia engine and an 8-megapixel camera capable of recording 720p high-definition video. It also features a front-facing VGA camera - excluded from the Xperia Arc - which allows for video chat.


== Reception ==
Generally, the phone has received positive reviews from sites such as GSMArena, being praised for its camera and Android operating system as opposed to the Symbian equivalent used for the Vivaz.


== Software ==
The phone shipped with Android 2.3 and an official update to Android 4.0 was made available in May 2012. Sony Ericsson, by then going under the name Sony Mobile, did not make any higher Android version updates available for the Xperia neo. Unofficial updates up to Android 4.4 are available.


== Xperia Neo V ==
A similar model named Xperia Neo V was released in October 2011. Unlike the Xperia Neo, it has a 5-megapixel camera without Exmor R. Sony Ericsson has stated that it is due to a shortage of 8-megapixel camera sensors. The other specifications are exactly the same.
