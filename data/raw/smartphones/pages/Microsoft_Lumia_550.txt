== Reception ==
Michael Allison of MSPoweruser criticized the Lumia 550 for having lower specs than its predecessor, such as an inferior 5 MP camera that lacks a wide angle lens, missing functionality and a shorter battery life, making it uncompetitive with similar phones in its price range.
Sean Cameron of Techradar gave the Lumia 550 3 stars out of 5, praising its screen, camera and speakers, but criticizing the battery life and performance and calling the Windows 10 Mobile operating system "unfinished".
