The Samsung SGH-i607, marketed as BlackJack, is a smartphone with a QWERTY keyboard released in 2006, that was available through AT&T in the United States and Telstra in Australia. On the other hand, the Samsung i600 was the model offered in Europe using different 3G frequencies.


== Brand controversy ==
In January 2007 Research In Motion, creators of the BlackBerry handhelds, filed suit in United States federal court claiming the BlackJack trademark was too similar to the BlackBerry mark. They alleged that Samsung had named their smartphone with a word beginning with "Black" just to mislead the customers that would come to the cellphone stores with the intention to purchase a BlackBerry. A month later the two parties settled out of court. In January 2008, Rogers Wireless and Fido Solutions released the Blackjack II in Canada under the name Jack.


== Hardware defect ==
For handsets manufactured between November 2006 and February 2007, there is a known defect in the antenna assembly, causing a large number of dropped calls.


== Successor ==
The successor to the BlackJack was the Samsung BlackJack II. It was available in the U.S. for AT&T and in Canada for Rogers.
