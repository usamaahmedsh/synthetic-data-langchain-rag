A mobile software content rating system is a rating system which is tailored to users of mobile software.


== Comparison table ==
A comparison of current mobile software rating systems, showing age on the horizontal axis. Note however that the specific criteria used in assigning a classification can vary widely from one country/system to another. Thus a color code or age range cannot be directly compared from one country to another.
Key: 

 White  – No restrictions: Suitable for all ages / Aimed at young audiences / Exempt / Not rated / No applicable rating.
 Yellow  – Advisory: Parental guidance is suggested for designated age range.
 Purple  – Strong advisory: Not recommended for a younger audience but not restricted.
 Red  – Restricted: Parental accompaniment required for younger audiences.
 Black  – Prohibitive: Exclusively for older audience / Restricted to licensed premises / Purchase age-restricted / Banned.
Explanations of specific ratings are available in corresponding articles.


== Existing systems ==


=== App Store (iOS/iPadOS) ===

Since iOS 26, Apple's rating system for the App Store has followed the following rubric:

4+: Contains no objectionable material. Apps specifically aimed at children can be placed into one of three subcategories: ages 5 and under, 6–8 and 9–11.
9+: May contain content unsuitable for children under the age of 9.
13+: May contain content unsuitable for children under the age of 13. Replaces the 12+ rating.
16+: May contain content unsuitable for children under the age of 16. Replaces the 17+ rating.
18+: May contain content unsuitable for children under the age of 18. Replaces the 17+ rating.
Apps rated 17+ were prohibited from purchase by younger users.


=== Google Play ===
Up until March 17, 2015 Google Play used the following rubric:

Everyone
Low maturity
Medium maturity
High maturity
Google now uses the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) in most countries not represented by a rating authority, whilst countries or regions with a superimposed video game rating authority continues applying their own ratings where applicable. 
This includes Americas (except Brazil), where ESRB is imposed, Brazil with ClassInd, Europe and Israel with PEGI, Australia with ACB and South Korea with GRAC. However, a new Google Play Rating system is used exclusively in Russia and for non-gaming apps in South Korea. 
These ratings include:

3+
7+
12+
16+
18+
In Australia, IARC applies its own ratings for non-gaming apps.
