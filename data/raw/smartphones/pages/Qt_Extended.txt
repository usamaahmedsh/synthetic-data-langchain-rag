Qt Extended (named Qtopia before September 30, 2008) is an application platform for embedded Linux-based mobile computing devices such as personal digital assistants, video projectors and mobile phones.  It was initially developed by The Qt Company, at the time known as Qt Software and a subsidiary of Nokia. When they cancelled the project the free software portion of it was forked by the community and given the name Qt Extended Improved. The QtMoko Debian-based distribution is the natural successor to these projects as continued by the efforts of the Openmoko community.

An unofficial hack allows its use on the Archos wifi series of portable media players (PMP) 604, 605, 705, and also on several Motorola phones such as E2, Z6 and A1200. The U980 of ZTE is the last phone running it.

Native applications could be developed and compiled using C++. Managed applications could be developed in Java.


== Discontinuation ==
On March 3, 2009, Qt Software announced the discontinuation of Qt Extended as a standalone product, with some features integrated on the Qt Framework.


== Qt Extended Improved ==
The Openmoko community has forked the final stable release into Qt Extended Improved (later renamed to QtMoko) which, like its predecessor, is an application platform for embedded Linux-based mobile computing devices such as personal digital assistants, video projectors and mobile phones dual licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and proprietary licenses.
