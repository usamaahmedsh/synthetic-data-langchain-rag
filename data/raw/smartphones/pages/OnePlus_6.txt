== History ==
In March 2018, it was announced that the phone would have a "notch", but that there would be an option to hide it. On 2 April 2018, it was confirmed that the premium edition of the OnePlus 6 would feature the Snapdragon 845 processor, 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal storage.
OnePlus opened forums for the OnePlus 6 in April 2018.
One week after the OnePlus 6 went on sale, OnePlus acknowledged a software bug that caused the device to drop all audio when a phone call was switched to speakerphone. This was later resolved in a 5.1.6 software update.
In November 2021, OnePlus stopped supplying software updates to the operating system.
