== Reception ==
The Huawei Ascend P7 received mixed to positive reviews. Andrew Hoyle of CNET praised the 6.5 mm thin body with glass construction, high-resolution front camera, and bright full HD display, but argued about its slow processor and inconvenient Android skin. Gary Cutlack of TechRadar liked the launcher design lacking an app drawer, the image quality of the front-facing camera, and the low weight, but disliked the low battery life and unresponsive user interface. The review noted that the phone was "uninspiring" and cannot effectively compete with other 2014 flagship devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the HTC One (M8), despite its relatively high off-contract price. Daniel P. of PhoneArena appreciated the design of the device, good quality 1080p display, and camera quality, but noted its mid-range processor and slow web browser.


== Software support ==
The Ascend P7 is upgradeable to Android Lollipop (5.1), and the latest security update was released in August 2017.
