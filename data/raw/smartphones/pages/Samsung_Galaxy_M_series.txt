The Samsung Galaxy M series is a line of primarily online entry-level and mid-range budget smartphones manufactured by Samsung Electronics, marketed primarily for India and other emerging markets. The first models in the series, the Samsung Galaxy M10 & M20, were released on February 5, 2019; they were followed by the Samsung Galaxy M30 on March 7 and the Samsung Galaxy M40 on June 18. The Samsung Galaxy M10s and Samsung Galaxy M30s were announced on September 18, and both were released on September 29. The Galaxy M01 and M11 were released on June 2, 2020 and were available for sale on both online and offline platforms. On September 10, Samsung announced the Galaxy M51, the first upper mid-range model in the lineup.
The primary selling point of the lineup is the higher-capacity battery, following the common trend within budget smartphones in the late-2010s. It is positioned below the Galaxy A series, although several models were derived from the Galaxy A series with several alterations.
Exclusively for the Indian market, Samsung also released a rebranded variant of the Galaxy M series, known as the Galaxy F series, in collaboration with Flipkart.


== Description ==
Being positioned at the mid-range and low-end segments, all models in the series have all the essential features of an entry-level smartphone, besides some other advanced features, thus differentiating them from other series and also differ in size and design. Samsung targets Asian developing markets or the European entry-level market with the lineup as a response to the growing popularity of smartphones offered by Chinese manufacturers such as Xiaomi, realme and infinix.
