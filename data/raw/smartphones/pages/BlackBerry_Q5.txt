The BlackBerry Q5 is a mid-range touchscreen-based QWERTY smartphone developed by BlackBerry, previously known as RIM (Research In Motion). It is the third BlackBerry 10 smartphone, unveiled at the BlackBerry Live 2013 Keynote on May 14, 2013.
Replacing the BlackBerry Curve line, the Q5 serves as the budget counterpart of the more upmarket BlackBerry Q10/Z10 and is mainly targeted largely at emerging markets because of its lower end specifications. Like the previous entry-level BlackBerry devices, it is also available in multiple color options; black, white, red, pink and grey.


== Features ==
Compared to the Q10, Q5's keyboard has more space between the individual buttons, reminiscent of the previous BlackBerry Curve lineup which it replaced. The display is an IPS LCD as opposed to  AMOLED on the Q10, while the camera resolution is 5 megapixels (8 megapixels on the Q10).  
Exclusive features include BlackBerry Hub, which allows users to view email, messages, and social network updates with a swipe to the side while using any application.


== Availability ==
The BlackBerry Q5 was first available in the United Arab Emirates and later in India and Canada. The target regions for this product are Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. India is the first country in Asia Pacific where this product was launched. In 2014, BlackBerry had a large portion of the smartphone market in India.
