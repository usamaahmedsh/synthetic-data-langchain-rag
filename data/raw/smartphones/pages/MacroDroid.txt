MacroDroid is an Android application that enables users to automate tasks on their devices by creating custom macros triggered by specific events or conditions.  Each macro created in the application consists of a trigger, one or more actions, and optional constraints to control execution.
The app supports plugins for Tasker and has been described as a more user-friendly alternative to it.


== History ==
MacroDroid has been in active development since at least 2012. Over the years, it has received regular updates introducing new features and compatibility improvements. In 2014, the app added support for automation on Wear OS devices, allowing users to extend macros to their smartwatches.


== Features ==
MacroDroid allows for automation using a simple interface designed for non-technical users. A typical macro setup consists of:

Triggers – Events that initiate a macro, such as receiving a text message, connecting to Wi-Fi, or a specific time.
Actions – Tasks performed when the trigger occurs, including toggling system settings, sending messages, or launching applications.
Constraints – Optional conditions that restrict when a macro runs (e.g., only on weekdays, or when battery is above a certain level).
The app includes a wide range of built-in triggers and actions, along with support for system-level tasks on rooted devices. While many functions are available without root access, certain advanced features such as toggling mobile data or performing shell commands may require root privileges.
MacroDroid also includes a community-driven template system, where users can share and download pre-configured macros.


== Reception ==
MacroDroid has received positive reviews for its accessibility, ease of use, and effectiveness. It has been praised as a strong alternative to more complex automation tools, offering a balance between functionality and user-friendliness. Reviewers have noted that its intuitive interface lowers the barrier to entry for those new to mobile automation.


== Usage ==
MacroDroid functions on both rooted and non-rooted devices. While most core features are accessible without root, some advanced tasks require elevated permissions. The app is available in both free and premium versions, with the free version supporting a limited number of macros and displaying ads.
