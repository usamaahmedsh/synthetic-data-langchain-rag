== Changes from the Nokia 7.1 ==
The Nokia 7.2 has three rear cameras, including a 0.6x zoom ultrawide camera, and one front camera. The main rear camera is a 48 MP camera that is set to 12 MP by default, improving the quality of the camera, in terms of megapixels, in comparison the Nokia 808 PureView and Lumia 1020. A dedicated night mode camera was introduced in the 7.2, which claims to help "improve low-light photography".
The screen is larger than on the 7.1, with 99.1 cm2 (6.3") instead of 85.1 cm2 (5.84"). The display has a smaller chin and bezels, along with a thinner dewdrop notch at the top. The 7.2 is heavier, weighing 180g rather than the 160g of the Nokia 7.1. The addition of Nokia Face ID, made by Truly Secure, has also been added to the software of the 7.2.
In terms of the phone's exterior, there is a dedicated Google Assistant button on the left of the phone, which can be pressed to quickly activate the Google Assistant, or held and released for the Google Assistant to start and stop listening. It can also be re-mapped in the phone settings to open an app of choice.
The 7.2 has a more powerful SoC, with a Snapdragon 660 rather than a 636. The 7.2 comes with a 3500 mAh battery, while the 7.1 has 3060 mAh. However, the 7.2 does not support fast charging and the phone charges at 10 Watts instead of 18. Expandable storage has increased from 400 to 512 GB.
