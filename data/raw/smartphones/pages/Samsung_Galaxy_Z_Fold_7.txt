The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (stylized as Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7) is an Android-based foldable smartphone developed and marketed by Samsung Electronics.

=== Design and display ===
The Galaxy Z Fold 7 features updated dimensions and weight compared to its predecessor, the Galaxy Z Fold 6. When folded, it measures approximately 168.4 × 72.6 × 8.9 mm, and when unfolded, it measures 158.2 × 143 × 4.2 mm. The device weighs approximately 215 grams, making it the lightest and thinnest model in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold line-up to date. These changes result from further refinements to the hinge and frame design, while maintaining the book-style folding format that defines the series.
The Z Fold 7 features two Dynamic AMOLED 2X displays. The cover display measures 6.5 inches with a resolution of 2520 × 1080 pixels, and now adopts a 21:9 aspect ratio, offering a wider viewing experience compared to its predecessor. The main foldable display measures 8.0 inches with a resolution of 2184 × 1968 pixels and can reach up to 2,600 nits of brightness under specific conditions, such as when using Vision Booster in direct sunlight.
At launch, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is available in three standard color options: Jet Black, Blue Shadow, and Silver Shadow. A fourth variant, Mint, is available exclusively through Samsung's online store.


=== Flex mode ===
Flex Mode is a feature available on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 that utilizes the device's foldable hinge mechanism to enable split-screen functionality when the device is partially folded, typically between 75 and 115 degrees.
In this configuration, supported applications display content on the upper half of the screen, while interactive controls appear on the lower half. For example, in apps such as YouTube, Samsung Notes, and video conferencing apps, users can view content or calls on the top screen while accessing playback tools, editing options, or a virtual touchpad below.
Flex Mode is intended to support multitasking by allowing simultaneous interaction with different parts of an application through the device's foldable form factor.
