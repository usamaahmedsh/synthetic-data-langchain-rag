The LG Watch Urbane is a smartwatch released by LG Corporation on April 27, 2015. There are gold and silver models, each with a 22mm-wide interchangeable strap. The watch has IP67 dust and water resistance. 
The  LG Watch Urbane runs Android Wear and is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 SoC, 512MB of LPDDR2 RAM, and 4GB of eMMC storage. The OLED display is a POLED variant with an equivalent resolution to a square display of 320x320, and has capacitive touch input.
The watch communicates with its companion Android phone or iPhone using Bluetooth v4.1LE, and has 2.4 GHz 802.11b/g/n WiFi for synchronizing Google Services data.
The watch has nine axis movement sensors (gyro, accelerometer, compass), barometer, and a heart rate sensor. The watch has a microphone which is used with Google Assistant's speech recognition. Unlike newer Wear devices it doesn't have a speaker, so it can only vibrate for alerts. The watch charges through contacts on its back, which connect via sprung "pogo" pins to a magnetically clamped puck, and the puck has a microUSB connector and thus requires an external power source.
A second model, the Watch Urbane LTE, has cellular connectivity and runs WebOS instead of Android.
