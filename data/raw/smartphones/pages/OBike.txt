oBike was a Singapore-registered stationless bicycle-sharing system started by businessmen Yi Shi and Edward Chen with operations in several countries. The bikes have a built-in Bluetooth lock and can therefore be left anywhere at the end of a journey, not just at a docking station. Users use a smartphone app to locate and rent bikes. It launched in Singapore in February 2017, and ceased operation on 25 June 2018 in Singapore. Subsequently, the parent company filed for insolvency in its home market. The effect on operations outside of Singapore is unknown.
The firm had expanded to 24 countries including Australia, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom.   


== The system ==

The bicycles were single speed with a plastic chainguard, short mudguards on both wheels, front and rear rim brakes, and dynamo electric lights.
To make use of the system, the user had to download the oBike application, register and pay a deposit. The App was used to rent and return the bicycles and users were charged by 15 or 30 minutes, with payment charged to their Credit/Debit card. To ride bikes, users needed to have an internet connection and Bluetooth enabled on their mobile device to enable unlocking of their desired oBike, which was done by scanning the QR code or entering the corresponding bicycle number. If successful, the lock on the rear wheel opened automatically. Once users finished with their ride, they needed to manually lock and leave the bike in any parking spot to be ready for the next user. At the time of locking the bike, the user must again ensure they had a Bluetooth and an internet connection, in order for the oBike system to record the end of the ride and correctly calculate the hire charge. If violations were reported, a credit system penalized the corresponding user after a certain number of times, and in extreme cases, the user could be suspended from the platform. At the beginning of 2018 oBike entered into a partnership with TRON. In addition customers of oBike could use the app to pay with a Cryptocurrency called ″oCoin″ which the company planned to offer.
