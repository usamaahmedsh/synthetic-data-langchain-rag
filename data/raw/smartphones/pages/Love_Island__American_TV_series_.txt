The series is notable for strategically utilizing social media to promote the show, with clips often going viral across varied platforms, leading many critics to label it a "pop culture phenomenon."

== Format ==
Love Island involves a group of contestants, referred to as Islanders, living in isolation from the outside world in a villa, constantly under video surveillance. To survive in the villa the Islanders must be coupled up with another Islander, whether it be for love, friendship, or survival, as the overall winning couple receives $100,000. On the first day, the Islanders couple up for the first time based on first impressions, but over the duration of the series, they are forced to "re-couple" where they can choose (or be chosen) to remain in their current couple or swap and change.
Any Islander who remains single after the coupling is eliminated and "dumped" from the island. Islanders can also be eliminated via a public vote during the series. The public can vote for their favorite couple or who they think is the most compatible through the Love Island app available on smartphones. Couples who receive the fewest votes risk being eliminated. Occasionally, twists may occur where the islanders must eliminate each other. During the final week, the public vote for which couple they want to win the series and take home the prize.
Whilst in the villa, each Islander has their own phone with which they can only contact other Islanders via text – or receive texts informing them of the latest challenges, dumping, or re-coupling. Islanders and couples take part in many games and challenges. Some Islanders are also sent on dates outside the villa, or can win dates by winning challenges. Occasionally, a pair of islanders are chosen to be sent to The Hideaway, where they are able to spend one night together apart from the other couples.
