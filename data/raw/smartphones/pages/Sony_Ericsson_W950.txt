The Sony Ericsson W950i is the third UIQ 3 smartphone based on Symbian OS v9.1. It was announced on February 13, 2006, a week after the announcement of the Sony Ericsson M600.


== Background ==
The W950 is Sony Ericsson's sixth 'Walkman'-series phone. One of its distinguishing features is the 4 GB internal flash memory, perfect for media storage. However, it does not support memory expansion with any type of memory card.


== Hardware ==
With many core similarities to the M600, the W950 also uses the UIQ 3 software platform, which is based upon Symbian OS 9.1. The touchscreen displays 262,144 colours (18-bit colour depth) with a resolution of 240x320 pixels at 2.6 inches long in diagonal. The W950 runs on the Nexperia PNX4008 ARM9 208 MHz processor from Philips and has 64MB RAM and 128MB Flash ROM. This processor also includes a PowerVR MBX GPU for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics.


== Developing for the W950i ==
Since the W950i is based upon the UIQ platform, it is easy to make third party applications that can be downloaded to the phone. Developers can choose their preferred programming language (Java, C++, etc.) and IDE (Visual Studio, CodeWarrior, Eclipse, Carbide, NetBeans).
