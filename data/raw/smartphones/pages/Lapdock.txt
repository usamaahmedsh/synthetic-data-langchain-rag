A lapdock is a type of accessory designed to transform mobile devices, such as smartphones, into laptop-like computers by providing a display, keyboard, battery, and other essential components typically found in a laptop. Unlike laptops, lapdocks lack internal processing power, relying on the connected device (e.g., a smartphone, tablet, or mini PC) for computation. Lapdocks are most commonly used with devices that support desktop-style operating modes, such as Samsung DeX and Windows Continuum, which was a feature on Windows 10. The name lapdock is a portmanteau of laptop and dock, derived from docking station.


== History ==
The concept of lapdocks emerged in the early 2010s with the growing desire to use smartphones for tasks traditionally performed on personal computers. One of the earliest and most notable implementations was the Motorola Atrix 4G in 2011, which could be paired with the Motorola Lapdock, allowing users to run a desktop-like environment when connected to the accessory. Although the Atrix received praise for its innovation, the lapdock failed to gain widespread adoption, partly due to the high cost of the accessory.
Other companies, such as HP with its Elite X3, and Samsung with its DeX platform, further refined the lapdock concept. The Samsung DeX platform, for example, allowed compatible Galaxy smartphones to connect to an external monitor or lapdock and operate in a desktop-like mode.


== Key features ==
Lapdocks typically include the following components:

Display: Lapdocks are equipped with an integrated screen, typically ranging from 11 to 15 inches, similar to that of a laptop.
Keyboard and Trackpad: Lapdocks  feature a full-sized keyboard and a trackpad, providing a familiar laptop interface.
Battery: Lapdocks often include a built-in battery that powers the display and may charge the connected mobile device while in use.
Ports and Connectivity: Lapdocks typically provide USB, HDMI, and other ports for connecting peripherals like a mouse, keyboard, or storage devices.
Unlike traditional laptops, a lapdock cannot function independently without being connected to a compatible device, which supplies the processing power and software.
