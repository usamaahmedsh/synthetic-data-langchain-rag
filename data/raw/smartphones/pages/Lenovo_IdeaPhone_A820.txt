== Reviews ==
Lenovo A820 received a very warm reception across the world, despite the fact that it is directly available only in China, India, Indonesia, Russia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
In a review for Mobile Network Comparison the author summarized that Lenovo A820 "offers incomparable value compared to almost any phone available on British high streets".
It is criticized basically only for a lack of LED flash and a local Chinese stock ROM without multilingual and Google Play Store support.
