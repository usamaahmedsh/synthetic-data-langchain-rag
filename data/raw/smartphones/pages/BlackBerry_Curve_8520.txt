The BlackBerry Curve 8520 (also known as BlackBerry Gemini) is a smartphone from the BlackBerry Curve series manufactured in Canada that was launched on August 27, 2009 and was in production until April 2012. It was BlackBerry's first entry-level device, targeted for emerging market consumers.


== Description ==
The BlackBerry Curve 8520 was a consumer-oriented smartphone and had standard features including mobile email, a calendar and instant messaging among many others.
The Curve 8520 had a new touch-sensitive optical trackpad as opposed to the trackball used on many other BlackBerry devices - this is said to improve the ease of scrolling through menus, emails, web pages and images.
This phone was capable of browsing the web with the EDGE network and receive and send emails via BlackBerry's push email network. 
The Curve 8520 was discontinued in April 2012, when the BlackBerry Curve 9220 was introduced as its successor.
