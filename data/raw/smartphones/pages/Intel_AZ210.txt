== Advertisement controversy ==
In June 2012, a television advertisement for the Orange San Diego was broadcast on British television and featured a fast car in computer generated imagery. Richard Noble claimed that the car was a representation of ThrustSSC, a land speed record car that broke the sound barrier in 1997, and thus these companies had used his intellectual property without permission, putting the future of the successor Bloodhound SSC project in doubt. The Advertising Standards Authority rejected the Bloodhound team's complaint, claiming that intellectual property disputes were not in its remit. According to BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, Intel and Orange responded that their production team had researched different styles of "superfast vehicles" and developed their own Orange-branded land speed car, and that the advertisement and phone were not connected to Noble or Bloodhound SSC.
