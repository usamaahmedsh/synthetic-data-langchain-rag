== History ==
Dixon Technologies was founded in 1993 by Sunil Vachani. His father, Sundar Vachani had been manufacturing televisions under the Weston brand, which had launched the first colour television in India; his business struggled later on due to the emergence of other companies. Dixon initially manufactured 14-inch televisions, Sega video game consoles, Philips video recorders, and push-button phones for Bharti Airtel. A major breakthrough came in the 2000s when the company won a Government contract to manufacture televisions. Apart from televisions and video recorders, the company also started to manufacture air conditioners and microwave ovens for LG Electronics, as well as DVD players for other brands.
In 2018, Dixon signed a deal with Xiaomi to manufacture LED television sets at its Tirupati plant.
In January 2020, Dixon entered a partnership with Samsung for the local production of LED televisions.
In December 2024, Dixon Technologies and the Chinese mobile phone brand Vivo are forming a joint venture to manufacture electronic devices, including smartphones.
