Astro Zhi Zun HD (Astro至尊HD in Simplified Chinese) was a Malaysian channel that began broadcasting on 16 June 2010 as Astro's first Chinese-language channel and non-English language HD channel. This channel mirrored 80% of the content on its sister channel Astro Wah Lai Toi, including drama series and sitcoms on weekdays, as well as variety shows, game shows and travelogues.
Until 12 January 2013, Astro Zhi Zun HD featured programmes in Mandarin and Cantonese. This included Chinese dramas, documentaries, variety shows, TVB content, and local Cantonese programmes. The non-Cantonese content on Astro Zhi Zun HD was then moved to Astro Quan Jia HD.
Astro Zhi Zun HD was renamed to Astro Wah Lai Toi HD on 6 October 2014.
