Disney XD was a pan-Asian pay television channel owned by The Walt Disney Company (Southeast Asia) Pte. Ltd., and part of the Disney Branded Television division of Walt Disney Television in the United States. Following Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019, the channel was operated by Disney Networks Group Asia Pacific. Aimed primarily at children aged 6 to 15, it featured a lineup that included Marvel and Star Wars series, reruns of shows previously aired on Disney Channel, various action series, and some preschool programming from Disney Junior.


== History ==
Disney XD launched in Malaysia on 15 September 2012, as the first international kids' channel available on Astro's basic package. It expanded to Singapore on March 16, 2013, Indonesia and Thailand on 19 October 2013, and the Philippines on 31 May 2014. After Disney Channel India and Disney XD India were banned in Bangladesh for broadcasting in Hindi, Disney XD Asia became available on a few digital cable platforms in 2016.
Due to changes in Astro's programming and the launch of Disney+ Hotstar, Disney XD and Disney Junior stopped broadcasting on Astro and its affiliated platforms on 1 June 2021. As part of a broader review of Disney's business in the region, Disney XD ended operations in Southeast Asia on 1 January 2021 (simultaneously with the Scandinavian and Middle Eastern feeds), after over eight years of broadcasting.
In 2019, the Malaysian feed of Disney XD Asia was merged into the main feed, with Astro converting Disney XD to an HD-only channel. Disney XD was not distributed in Hong Kong or Vietnam; instead, selected Disney XD programs were available on Disney Channel Asia. Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Disney Junior also ceased transmission in Singapore on 1 June 2020, with some content moving to Disney+ on 23 February 2021.
Following the closure of Disney XD, its content was moved to Disney Channel in Southeast Asia (the channel had already ceased transmission in Singapore and Malaysia in 2020, but continued operations for other Southeast Asian countries until the closure in October 2021), Disney+ Hotstar in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, and Disney+ in Singapore and the Philippines. In the Philippines, Disney XD was replaced by Metro Channel on 4 January 2021, while in Malaysia, it was replaced by TA-DAA! on 15 March 2021, later rebranded as the DreamWorks Channel in February 2023.
