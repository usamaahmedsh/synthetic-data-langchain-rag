Playroom, also known as Brill's Playroom or Hubert Brill's Playroom, is an American television series that aired on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network on Fridays at 7 p.m. (Eastern time) from January 9 to May 28, 1948.
The host, Brooklyn-born Hubert Brill, was a member of the Society of American Magicians and known for playing a minor role in the movie Out Of The Past (1947), which immediately preceded his run on Playroom.
Sponsor magazine described the program as a family variety show featuring "talented guests from the entertainment world."
Playroom was a "sustaining" feature on the DuMont network, attracting no sponsors during its brief run.
