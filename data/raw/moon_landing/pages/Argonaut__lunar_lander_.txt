Argonaut or European Large Logistics Lander (EL3) is a class of lunar landers designed by the European Space Agency (ESA) in partnership with Thales Alenia Space to deliver payloads to the surface of the Moon. The lander is being designed with a versatile set of uses in mind, including use as a power station, support for a rover, cargo delivery, and infrastructure delivery. It is envisioned to launch on the Ariane 64 launch vehicle. 


== Design ==
The Argonaut lander will consist of a descent element, cargo platform, and payload. Capable of delivering up to 1,500 kg (3,300 lb), the craft will reportedly be able to land with an accuracy of 250 meters and to last up to five years on the Moon. The lander's reaction control system will consist of 24 monopropellant thrusters. Each of the three main engines, using electric pumps and MMH/MON as propellants, will be able of generating 6 kN of thrust and will be throttleable to 50%.


== Background ==
The lander is being developed under the ESA's Terrae Novae programme for crewed and robotic space exploration. Thales Alenia Space (Italy) is the prime contractor and system integrator for the Lunar Descent Element. Thales Alenia Space (France) is developing data-handling subsystems and computers. OHB System AG (Germany) is responsible for guidance, navigation, and control systems, as well as communication and electrical power systems including solar arrays and batteries. Thales Alenia Space (UK) is providing propulsion subsystems including propellant tanks. Nammo (UK) is providing the RELIANCE main engine. Redwire Corporation (Luxembourg) is developing the robotic arm known as Manipulator for Argonaut Payload Needs and Unloading Support (MANUS).


== Project history ==
In 2022, ESA successfully sought funding for the lander at its ministerial council. In 2023, Neil Murray became the Engineering Team Leader for Argonaut.
In 2024, ESA committed to an Argonaut mission in 2031 and awarded a contract to develop a robotic arm for use on the lander to Redwire Space. Two designs were considered for the lander's main engine: the SPE-T developed by ArianeGroup and tested first in 2024, and the RELIANCE engine by Nammo.
On 30 January 2025, ESA awarded a contract to Thales Alenia Space (Italy) to build the descent element of the lander and later in 2025, Thales Alenia Space signed agreements with Thales Alenia Space in France, OHB in Germany, and Thales Alenia Space and Nammo in the United Kingdom for supplying various subsystems of the Lunar Descent Element. The first mission of Argonaut was scheduled for 2030.
In March 2025, ESA and JAXA signed a statement of intent detailing possible future cooperation between the Argonaut lunar lander and the Japanese pressurised rover under development for the Artemis program, as well as possible Japanese scientific investigations on Argonaut.
Before the ministerial council in November 2025, ESA has prepared a €600 million funding request for further development of Argonaut, leading to the first Moon landing in 2030, with a plan to build five landers. The second mission was planned for 2033.


== Missions ==


=== ArgoNET ===
ArgoNET (Argo Navigation, Energy, and Telecommunications) will be the first operational flight of the programme, planned for launch in 2030. It will deliver navigation, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure and will serve as a selenodetic reference station for the Moonlight satellite constellation. ArgoNET will include the NovaMoon system, designed to enhance the accuracy of the Moonlight initiative's satellite navigation services to reach sub-meter levels across the entire Lunar south pole.


=== Astrophysical Lunar Observatory ===
If approved, the Astrophysical Lunar Observatory (ALO) will be a low-frequency radio interferometer on the far side of the Moon consisting of several hundred antennas. The observatory is expected to be deployed by Argonaut around 2035.
