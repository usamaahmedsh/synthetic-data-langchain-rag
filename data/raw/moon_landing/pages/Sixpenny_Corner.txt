Sixpenny Corner was the UK's first daily TV soap opera, broadcast by ITV from September 1955 until June 1956. The programme was created by Jonquil Antony and Hazel Adair; the latter later co-created Crossroads. The 15-minute episodes centred on a recently married young couple, Bill and Sally Norton, played by Howard Pays and Patricia Dainton. The setting was the fictional rural town of Springwood, where Bill ran a small garage business at Sixpenny Corner.
All of the 180 episodes are lost.
