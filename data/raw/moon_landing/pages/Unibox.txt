Unibox is a satellite, cable and terrestrial digital receiver (set-top box). It has been distributed widely for use with Pay TV. It also enables the receiver to store digital copies of MPEG TS on internal harddisk or networked filesystems.


== Linux on the Uni-box ==
Unibox was based on the Linux operating system.
Originally Unibox was developed in Korea and sold in Europe, CIS, the Middle East and so on. Enthusiast groups in all over the world have developed localized software versions for the Unibox.

There are also many 3rd party plugins available. Plugins such as Weather forecast, YouTube, IRC chatting, WebCam, youporn, torrent are available.
In addition, unofficial third-party conditional access software modules (CAMs or emulators) are widely circulated on the Internet that emulate the CA systems developed by NDS (VideoGuard), Irdeto, Conax, Nagravision, Viaccess and other proprietary vendors. Some Uni-box owners use these softcams in conjunction with card sharing software to access pay TV services without a subscription card inserted in every connected box. This practice may be illegal in some jurisdictions and third-party software for this purpose is neither officially endorsed nor supported by UNIDIS and voids the official warranty.
