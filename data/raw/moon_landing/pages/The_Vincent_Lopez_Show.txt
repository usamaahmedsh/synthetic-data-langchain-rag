The Vincent Lopez Show, also known as Vincent Lopez Speaking, is a 1949-1957 American musical television program hosted by Vincent Lopez and broadcast on the DuMont Television Network, and later on CBS Television. The latter title is a take-off on Lopez's introduction on his longtime radio show: "Lopez speaking!"
