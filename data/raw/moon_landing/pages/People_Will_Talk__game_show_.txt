The object was to argue opposite sides of a question and try to find support of their opinions among a panel of fifteen celebrities. Two studio contestants competed against one another in arguing sides of a question, such as "Should a woman lie about her age?" resulting in either a yes or no answer. The contestants would state why they chose that side.
After hearing both sides of the story, the celebrity panel would then vote yes or no. After voting, contestants chose a celebrity that they thought agreed with their point of view. If the contestant and celebrity matched answers, the contestant won $25. If their points of view differed, the other contestant won the $25.
The first person to collect $100 won the game and merchandise prizes.
