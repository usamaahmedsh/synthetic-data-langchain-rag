Although many species have been to space, only a few have landed on the Moon. This is a list of species that have landed on the Moon, only including landings in which the payload survived. This list currently contains 10 species. Before 2019, only animals (in particular one species, Homo sapiens) landed on the Moon; in January 2019, plants and fungi also landed on the Moon.

== Future missions ==
These are future missions that plan to send additional organisms to the Moon.


=== Artemis 3 ===

In 2025, NASA plans to send four astronauts to the Moon, would include the first woman and the first person of color to land on the Moon. They would be the first human landing on the Moon in more than 50 years, since the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. In January 2024, NASA officially delayed the Artemis 3 mission to no earlier than September 2026.


=== ALEPH-1 ===

After the failed landing of Beresheet in 2019, which resulted in a crash, spilling thousands of tardigades onto the Moon, Lunaria One, an Australian organization, plans to send plants such as resurrection grass with the Israeli spacecraft  Beresheet 2 to the Moon in 2025.


== Species that have orbited or circled the Moon without landing ==

Humans and other animals have orbited or circled the Moon without landing. These include tortoises on Zond 5 (September 1968), Zond 6 (November 1968), and Zond 7 (August 1969), fruit flies on Zond 5, and five mice, Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey, who traveled in the 1972 Apollo 17 Command Module America and, along with astronaut Ronald Evans, still hold the record for the most orbits of the Moon (75).
