== Reception ==
The Guardian said in 1996 that through its interweaving of bleak updates from a shelter run by the RSPCA with dispatches from far-flung places, the show is "not as high up the cute-ometer as Animal Hospital, but certainly beats bird-watching with Bill Oddie". The newspaper stated in 1998 that Absolutely Animals "moves seamlessly from the hard edged to the cute and furry".
