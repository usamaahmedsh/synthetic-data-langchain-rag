== Plot ==
An aspiring comedian named Donny Dunn works as a bartender at a pub in London. He offers a free cup of tea to a weeping customer, Martha, to cheer her up. Martha develops an attachment to Donny and begins to stalk him both in person and online. As Donny attempts to further his career in comedy, the stalking begins to affect every aspect of his life, forcing him to understand his own behaviour, confront his sexuality, and come to terms with the trauma of a past sexual assault. As he attempts to escape Martha's stalking, the mix of fear, sympathy and revulsion he feels for his stalker threatens to ruin his life.

== Controversy ==
Fans began to speculate on social media about possible people who inspired the show's fictional characters. In April 2024 Gadd asked fans to cease speculating. After being falsely identified online as the factual person from whom the character Darrien was derived, the theatre director Sean Foley reported the false allegations to the police. The police investigated the reports. Gadd confirmed that Foley was not his source of the character.
On 9 May 2024, in an interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, 59-year-old Fiona Muir-Harvey, a Scottish woman with a law degree, claimed to have inspired the Martha character. Earlier tweets from a Twitter account linked to Muir-Harvey resulted in increased fan connections between her and the Martha character. These included a reference to hanging curtains, a sexually suggestive phrase that was later used in the script of Baby Reindeer. 
During her Uncensored interview, Muir-Harvey said that she had met Gadd several times at The Hawley Arms, Camden, but denied sending him 41,000 emails or going to his home, as was stated of her erstwhile character on the show. She said that she was planning to start legal action for defamation against both Gadd and Netflix for claiming the series is "a true story" and suggesting that she had been convicted of stalking and sexual assault, as is the Martha character in the series.
Muir-Harvey said she had sent up to 10 emails and a letter, as well as several tweets, to Gadd. She later claimed she was paid £250 to appear, and said that the interview left her feeling "a bit used". The interview drew some criticism, with people questioning the ethics of the event. 
Laura Wray, a lawyer and widow of the Scottish politician Jimmy Wray, said that she had briefly employed Muir-Harvey at her law firm in 1997. After Muir-Harvey was dismissed, she engaged in stalker-like behaviour towards Wray, forcing her to take out an injunction. 
On 6 June 2024 Muir-Harvey filed a lawsuit against Netflix in the United States, alleging defamation, negligence, and gross negligence, seeking $170 million in damages and claiming that the show "viciously destroyed" her. Netflix responded that viewers were unlikely to associate the character with Muir-Harvey. On 27 September US judge R. Gary Klausner dismissed Muir-Harvey's negligence and gross negligence claims, along with her request for punitive damages, but allowed her to continue the defamation case against Netflix. Klausner noted that the series begins by stating that "this is a true story", differentiating it from Gadd's play, which was said to be "based on a true story". He said that Netflix failed to verify Gadd's claims as asserted in the script, and rejected Netflix's defence that the character could not be tied to Muir-Harvey, saying that "they have specific similarities few others could claim to share". A federal judge set a date for court proceedings to begin on 6 May 2025 at the Central District of California court, but this was halted by an appeal lodged by Netflix at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
