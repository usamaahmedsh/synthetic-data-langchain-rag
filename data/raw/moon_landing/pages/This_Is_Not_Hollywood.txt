Originally titled This Is Not Hollywood: Avetrana (Italian: Avetrana: Qui non è Hollywood), the series premiered at the 19th Rome Film Festival on 16 October 2024. It was originally scheduled to be released on Disney+ in Italy on 25 October 2024.


=== Controversy ===
On 21 October 2024, the Court of Taranto, on behalf of the mayor of Avetrana, filed an appeal to block the series' release in Italy, claiming that the use of the town's name in the series' original title could be defamatory. In the appeal, Mayor Antonio Iazzi stated, "It is essential to preview [the series] in order to determine whether the association of the town's name with the film adaptation has a defamatory effect, representing it as an ignorant, backward, silent community, possibly dedicated to committing brutal crimes of such magnitude, contrary to reality."
On 23 October 2024, the appeal was accepted and the series' Italian release was suspended. In response, Disney+ and Groenlandia stated, "We do not agree with the judges. To comply with the order issued in the absence of cross-examination between the parties by the Court of Taranto, the launch of the series currently titled Avetrana - Qui non è Hollywood is postponed."
On 29 October 2024, Disney+ and Groenlandia announced that the series' title would be changed to This Is Not Hollywood (Italian: Qui non è Hollywood). It was released on Disney+ in Italy on 30 October 2024.


== Reception ==
Vittoria Scarpa of Cineuropa wrote, "Pippo Mezzapesa's miniseries about the murder of Sarah Scazzi is an example of how a horrible true crime story can be told without morbidity and by delving into the psychology of the characters". She further wrote, "The tone is respectful, the show avoids representing the unrepresentable (the crime itself), and the psychology of the characters is deep." She also commended the performances of the cast, specifically Federica Pala, Giulia Perulli, Vanessa Scalera, Imma Villa, Anna Ferzetti, and Giancarlo Commare.
