This is a list of named lunar craters, which are a small proportion of the overall crater population. Most of these features are impact craters; only some pertain to volcanism on the Moon. The crater nomenclature is governed by the International Astronomical Union, and this listing only includes features that are officially recognized by that scientific society.


== Craters ==
The lunar craters are listed in the following subsections. Where a formation has associated satellite craters, these are detailed on the main crater description pages.


=== Catalog ===
Lunar craters are listed alphabetically on the following partial lists:
