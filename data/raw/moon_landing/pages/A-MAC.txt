In television electronics, A-MAC is a form of analog video encoding, specifically a type of Multiplexed Analogue Components (MAC) encoding. It carries digital information: sound, and data-teletext on an FM subcarrier at 7 MHz. Since the vision bandwidth of a standard MAC signal is 8.4 MHz, the horizontal resolution on A-MAC has to be reduced to make room for the 7 MHz carrier. A-MAC has not been used in service.


== Technical details ==
MAC transmits luminance and chrominance data separately in time rather than separately in frequency (as other analog television formats do, such as composite video).
Audio and scrambling (selective access):

Audio, in a format similar to NICAM was transmitted digitally rather than as an FM subcarrier.
The MAC standard included a standard scrambling system, EuroCrypt, a precursor to the standard DVB-CSA encryption system.
