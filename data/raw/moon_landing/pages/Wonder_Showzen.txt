Wonder Showzen is an American adult puppet black comedy television series created by Vernon Chatman and John Lee for MTV2. It was  produced by PFFR Productions and USA Cable Entertainment, having rejected the series for the USA Network and sold it to MTV Networks.
Described as a children's television series for adults, the show's format is a parody of educational PBS Kids shows such as Sesame Street and The Electric Company (e.g. use of stock footage, puppetry, and clips of children being interviewed). In addition to general controversial comedy, it satirizes politics, religion, war, violence, sex, racism and culture with black comedy.


== Production ==
Wonder Showzen was created by Vernon Chatman and John Lee, who originally made an early concept of it back in 1999, and pitched to the USA Network in 2000, but after a few minutes of viewing, executives there quickly concluded it did not fit the network's programming style. However, MTV Networks purchased the series during a re-branding of MTV2, making Wonder Showzen part of its new programming lineup. It aired as part of Sic 'Em Fridays, along with Dirty Sanchez and Wildboyz. The pilot and early concept were named simply "Kids Show". The Wonder Showzen theme song was also called 'Kids Show'. Reruns of the show also aired on MTV and Comedy Central. Animation services were provided by Raw Power in the first episode and by Augenblick Studios in the rest of the series.
Paramount Home Entertainment released the first season of Wonder Showzen on DVD March 28, 2006. The second season of Wonder Showzen premiered on March 31, 2006, and had its season-two finale starring Clarence on May 19, 2006, on MTV2. This season was released on DVD October 10, 2006, with an easter egg that featured an animation contest. The grand prize was announced as the winner's animation appearing on "the next DVD", but the creators later said a third season was unlikely, and MTV did not renew the series for another season.

He's even cited the show as an influence behind the writing and editing of The Eric André Show on Adult Swim.
