An audio router is a device that transports audio signals from inputs to outputs.


== Inputs and Outputs ==
The number of inputs and outputs varies dramatically. The way routers are described is normally number of inputs by number of outputs e.g. 2×1, 256×256.


== Signals ==
The transported audio can be analog or digital. Digital audio usually is in the AES/EBU standard for broadcast use. Broadband routers can route more than one signal type e.g. analogue or more than one type of digital.


== Crosspoints ==
Because any of the inputs can be routed to any output, the internal arrangement of the router is arranged as a number of crosspoints which can be activated to pass the corresponding signal to the desired output.
