For All Mankind is an American science fiction drama television series created by Ronald D. Moore, Matt Wolpert, and Ben Nedivi and produced for Apple TV+ (now Apple TV). The series dramatizes an alternate history depicting "what would have happened if the global space race had never ended" after the Soviet Union succeeds in the first crewed Moon landing ahead of the United States. The title is inspired by the lunar plaque left on the Moon by the crew of Apollo 11, which reads, in part, "We Came in Peace for All Mankind".
The series stars an ensemble cast including Joel Kinnaman, Michael Dorman, Sarah Jones, Shantel VanSanten, Jodi Balfour, Wrenn Schmidt, Sonya Walger, and Krys Marshall. Cynthy Wu, Casey W. Johnson, and Coral Peña joined the main cast for the second season. Edi Gathegi joined in the third. Toby Kebbell, Tyner Rushing, Svetlana Efremova, and Daniel Stern joined in the fourth. The series features historical figures, played by actors or appearing through archival footage, including astronauts and NASA officials as well as American presidents and other politicians.
For All Mankind premiered on November 1, 2019. The show's second season was critically acclaimed and was nominated for the TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Drama. In July 2022, the series was renewed for a fourth season, which premiered on November 10, 2023. In 2023, the writers said that, from the beginning, they had discussed that their goal was that there would be "about seven seasons" and that the story will span "at least 70 years". In April 2024, the series was renewed for a fifth season, and it was announced that Star City, a spinoff series focusing on the Soviet space program, was in development.


== Premise ==
In an alternate timeline in 1969, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov becomes the first human to land on the Moon. This outcome devastates morale at NASA but also catalyzes a U.S. effort to catch up. With the Soviet Union emphasizing equality by including a woman in subsequent landings, the United States is forced to match pace, equally training women and ethnic minorities (who historically were largely excluded from the initial decades of U.S. space exploration). 
Pushed by higher competition, the Soviet and other blocs favor more competent leaders, modernizing earlier and on more rational ground. With sustained investments in technology, a broad, sustained, and global technological race takes place, with a wide range of dramatic civilian effects, such as early civil rights, electric vehicles, civilian fusion power, controlled CO2 production, and no climate crisis. Each subsequent season takes place about a decade later, with season two taking place in the 1980s, season three taking place in the 1990s, and season four taking place in the 2000s.
Ronald D. Moore explained how historical reality had been different from the series: "Sergei Korolev was the father of the Soviet space program; in our reality, he died during an operation in Moscow (in 1966) ... And after that point, their Moon program really never pulled together.... Our point of divergence was that Korolev lives, ... and he made their Moon landing happen."
