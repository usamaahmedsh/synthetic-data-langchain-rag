Television broadcasting started around the 1950s and has continued to grow and become more sophisticated. When the National Basketball Association broadcasts first aired, they were broken down into four categories including; pre game, halftime, post game, and game coverage. Pregame casting usually covered a summary of predictions, key factors, and injuries. Halftime covered what happened in the first half, and the post game covered the game as a whole and the outcome. The game broadcast was a live game announcing that gave a play by play.
