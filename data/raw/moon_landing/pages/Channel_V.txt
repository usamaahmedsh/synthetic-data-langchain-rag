== History ==


=== Early years ===


==== MTV Asia (15 September 1991 – 2 May 1994) ====
Channel [V] was originally launched on 15 September 1991 as MTV Asia (音樂台). It was a 24-hour music channel broadcast in English, Hindi and Chinese, focused on pop music.
On 2 May 1994, MTV Asia left the STAR TV Network as the contract with Viacom expired.


==== Channel [V] ====
On 27 May 1994, under the leadership of managing director Gary Davey, Channel [V] was launched as a replacement of MTV Asia with VJs (who used to work on MTV Asia) celebrating on air from various locations; the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, Downtown Tokyo, the Himalayas etc. At the same time, Channel [V] officially 'split' its beam, in effect, providing two separate services for different regional audiences within the AsiaSat 1's footprint. This enables the channel to provide appropriate programming and viewing time for its viewers from different regions in Asia.
On 5 June 1994, Channel [V] has opened up its production facilities in Taipei, Taiwan.
On 4 July 1994, Sigaw Manila was launched on the Northern Beam.
On 1 August 1994, BPL Oye! was launched on the Southern Beam.
On 5 June 1994, Channel [V] has opened up its production facilities in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India.
On 27 April 1995, the STAR TV Network starts transmitting Channel [V] on the Palapa B2R satellite to Indonesia and the Philippines.
On 30 April 1995, Channel [V] has opened up its production facilities in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates producing Sony Yalla!, the first ever Arabic Top 10 Countdown in the Middle East was launched on the Southern Beam.
On 4 August 1996, a Thai-localized feed of Channel [V] was launched in Thailand, as carried on Thai cable and satellite providers. This apparently replaced Channel [V] International in the country, but the pan-Asian feed would still be available in Thailand via both AsiaSat and Palapa satellites.
In 1997, Channel [V] International was launched in the Middle East on the Middle Eastern digital satellite TV platform Orbit Communications Company as part of the STAR Select package.
On 15 July 1997, Channel [V] International was launched in Japan on the Japanese digital satellite TV platform SKY PerfecTV!.
In 1999, the president of rival MTV Networks Asia conceded that Channel [V] was a very close competitor in Taiwan and Thailand.
On 27 April 2021, Disney announced that Channel [V] would be closing down on 1 October as part of its winddown of traditional cable/satellite networks across Southeast Asia and Hong Kong in favor of focusing on both Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. Thus the channel space initially created by the first incarnation of MTV Asia in 1991 subsequently ceased to exist on October 1, 2021. As a result, Channel [V] remains on-air only in Mainland China.


== Operating channel ==


=== Mainland China ===
Channel [V] Mainland China is the Chinese branch of the Channel [V] network. It started operating in Mainland China in 1994 as part of Channel [V] Asia. Fox International Channels Asia Pacific sold certain Mandarin language entertainment television channels that target Mainland China, including Channel [V] Mainland China, to China Media Capital. As a result, Channel [V] Mainland China is a part of Star China Media as of 2014 along with Xing Kong. The channel is free-to-air on 3715 H on AsiaSat 7 however in areas with strong 5G reception it can be hard to receive stable reception. Channel [V] switches between Simplified and Traditional Chinese with selected Channel [V] International programs airing with Chinese subtitles.
