Tele 9 Corazón (Spanish: "Tele 9 Heart") was a Colombian local state-run television channel, whose signal only reached Bogotá and was broadcast on Channel 9. It replaced privately owned Teletigre.
The Colombian state gave time slots for programming on Tele 9 Corazón to companies RTI, Punch, Caracol TV, Protón, Alberto Dangond Uribe, Eduardo Ruiz Martínez, Jorge Barón, and Alberto Acosta, among others.
In 1973, Tele 9 Corazón was replaced by Segunda Cadena, which would become Colombia's second national television network. Bogotá would have a local channel again in 1997 when Canal Capital signed on.
