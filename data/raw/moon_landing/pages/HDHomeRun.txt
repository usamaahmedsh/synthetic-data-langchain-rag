HDHomeRun is a network-attached digital television tuner box, produced by the company SiliconDust USA, Inc.


== Overview ==
Unlike standard set-top box (or set-top unit) appliances, the HDHomeRun does not have a video output that connects directly to the user's television. It instead receives a live TV signal and then streams the decoded video over a local area network to an existing smartphone, tablet computer, smart TV, streaming device, computer, or game console. This allows it to stream content to multiple viewing locations.


== Compatibility ==
The HDHomeRun can be controlled and viewed from a wide variety of DVR/PVR software, including Windows Media Center for Windows XP through 8.1, EyeTV 3 for macOS, and Myth TV for Linux.
Newer models of the HDHomeRun are DLNA certified.

== HDHomeRun PRIME ==
Introduced in late 2011, the HDHomeRun PRIME provided the ability to view and record all digital cable channels the user subscribed to without using a cable-supplied set-top box. The device employed a CableCARD to replace the set-top box. The HDHomeRun PRIME could be integrated with Windows Media Center. With 3 tuners, the PRIME let you record two programs and watch another program live simultaneously. Due to a change in FCC regulation (cable service providers no longer have to make CableCARDs available to their customers), they are no longer in production.


== HDHomeRun Premium TV ==
Launched in 2018, HDHomeRun Premium TV was a virtual MVPD service that worked with the HDHomeRun PRIME and HDHomeRun DVR service. A notable feature of this service was the ability to record the channel streams to a local hard drive for time-shifted viewing. In March 2019, HDHomeRun announced that it would shut down its Premium service.
