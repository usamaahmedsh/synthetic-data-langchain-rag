Artemis V is the fifth planned mission of NASA's Artemis program and the first crewed flight of the Blue Moon lander. The mission will launch four astronauts on a Space Launch System rocket and an Orion to the Lunar Gateway and will be the third lunar landing of the Artemis program. In addition, Artemis V will also deliver two new elements to the Gateway Space Station.


== Overview ==

Artemis V will launch four astronauts to the Lunar Gateway space station. The mission will deliver the European Space Agency's ESPRIT refueling and communications module and a Canadian-built robotic arm system for the Gateway. Also delivered will be NASA's Lunar Terrain Vehicle.
After docking to the Gateway, two astronauts will board the Blue Moon lunar lander and fly it down to the Lunar south pole to land near the Lunar Terrain Vehicle. This will be the first lunar landing since Apollo 17 to use an unpressurized lunar rover. It is planned to have the two astronauts on the surface of the Moon for about one week where they will conduct science and exploration activities.
As of March 2024, Artemis V is scheduled to launch no earlier than March 2030.


== Spacecraft ==


=== Space Launch System ===

The Space Launch System is a super-heavy-lift launcher used to launch the Orion spacecraft from Earth to a trans-lunar orbit.


=== Orion ===

Orion is the crew transport vehicle used by all Artemis missions. It will transport the crew from Earth to the Gateway orbit, and return them to Earth.


=== Gateway ===

Gateway is a small modular space station to be established in Near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) in late 2024. The first two Gateway elements will launch together aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in late 2024. The I-Hab habitat module will be delivered by Artemis IV.


=== Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander ===

The Blue Moon lander will transfer astronauts from the Gateway to the Lunar surface and back. Blue Origin will be the second provider to deliver Artemis astronauts to the lunar surface. NASA previously contracted SpaceX to develop and demonstrate the Starship Human Landing System.
Blue Origin will design, develop, test, and verify its Blue Moon lander to meet NASA's human landing system requirements for recurring astronaut expeditions to the lunar surface. In addition to design and development work, the contract includes one uncrewed demonstration mission to the lunar surface and the crewed demo in 2030. The total award value of the contract is $3.4 billion.


=== Lunar Terrain Vehicle ===

The Lunar Terrain Vehicle is an unenclosed rover being developed by NASA that astronauts will drive on the Moon while wearing spacesuits.
