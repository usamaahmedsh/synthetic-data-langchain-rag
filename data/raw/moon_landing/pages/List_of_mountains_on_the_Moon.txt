This is a list of mountains on the Moon (with a scope including all named mons and montes, planetary science jargon terms roughly equivalent to 'isolated mountain'/'massif' and 'mountain range').


== Caveats ==
This list is not comprehensive, as surveying of the Moon is a work in progress.
Heights are in meters; most peaks have not been surveyed with the precision of a single meter.
Mountains on the Moon have heights and elevations/altitudes defined relative to various vertical datums (referring to the lunoid), each in turn defined relative to the center of mass (CoM) of the Moon.
c. 1960 — the U.S. Army Mapping Service datum was established 1,737,988 meters from the CoM.
c. 1970 — the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency used 1,730,000 meters.
c. 1990 — The Clementine topographic data use 1,737,400 meters as the baseline, and show a range of about 18,100 meters from lowest to highest point on the Moon.
This is not a list of the highest places on the Moon, meaning those farthest from the CoM. Rather, it is a list of peaks at various heights relative to the relevant datum. This is because the Moon has mass asymmetries: the highest point, located on the far side of the Moon, is approximately 6,500 meters higher than Mons Huygens (usually listed as the tallest mountain).
