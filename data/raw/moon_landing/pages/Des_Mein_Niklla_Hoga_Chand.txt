The story takes off when Parminder meets Dev (Varun Badola) at her cousin's wedding in Chandigarh. They fall in love, but Pammi is already engaged to Dr. Rohan in London. They eventually get married, but alas happiness is not written in their destiny as Dev's ex-fiancé Anu marries Pammi's brother and has made it her task in taking revenge on Pammi by ending her and Dev's marriage.

== Production ==
Based on the backdrop of Punjab, the series was produced and directed by Aruna Irani. It was shot extensively in United Kingdom and India. Some initial scenes were shot at Chandigarh.
When Varun Badola quit, Amar Upadhyay was cast for his role of Dev in May 2003.
In October 2003, the series had a crossover with Kasautii Zindagii Kay when both completed two years on the same day with the characters Bubbles Singh from the series and Tapur from Kasautii getting married.
Initially produced by Aruna Irani under AK Films, during October 2004, StarPlus transferred the production of the series to Sphere Origins owing Irani's poor health conditions then. Planned to axe the series in December 2004 owing low ratings, StarPlus then gave the series time until April 2005 and cut the one hour timing of the series to half an hour for the ratings to improve. However, as it did not improve, it ended on 28 March 2005.

=== Critics and impact ===
In 2004 Outlook India quoted, "The soap has carried forward over the years in a compelling, realistic manner."
