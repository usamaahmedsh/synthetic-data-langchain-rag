Day of Rage: How Trump Supporters Took the U.S. Capitol is a 2021 American documentary short film about the January 6 Capitol attack by supporters of former president Donald Trump, reported by The New York Times.


== Summary ==
The film is the result of a six-month investigation of these events using videos posted on social media by the rioters themselves, police body camera footage, and archived audio from police communications, alongside news coverage. 
By combining District of Columbia police radio communications with real-time footage, the film illustrates how law enforcement officers attempted, and ultimately failed, to prevent the Capitol breach.
To maximize viewers' understanding of the events, the filmmakers also utilized a detailed 3D model of the Capitol complex. This 3D model was synchronized with footage and audio to show the precise movements of the rioters as they advanced through the building. By mapping the attackers’ progress onto a virtual representation of the Capitol, the documentary aims to produce a comprehensive, moment-by-moment visualization of the breach, illustrating how different groups converged and overran security barriers.


== Reception ==
The film received positive reviews. It was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject, but ultimately was not nominated. The video had earned 68,000 comments on YouTube. The video also won the Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award and Peabody Award. It was nominated for two News & Documentary Emmy Awards the following year.
