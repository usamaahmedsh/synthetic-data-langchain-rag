Sony Channel (formerly Sony Entertainment Television) was a Southeast Asian pay television channel broadcasting to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment. It was launched in July 2007 as an entertainment channel, and adopted its current name on 15 October 2014.
As a part of a plan to relaunch BeTV as Gem, all non-Asian programmes on BeTV were moved to Sony Channel, effective 15 October 2014.
After more than ten years of broadcasting, Sony Channel ceased broadcasting across Asia including Malaysia, Philippines, Hong Kong and Singapore on June 1, 2019 at midnight, while in Indonesia and Thailand the channel was discontinued a day earlier. The channel programmed with the final episode of Superstore; on that day, an ending with the season four finale encore "Employee Appreciation Day" as one of the last express from the U. S. telecast including full season binge before going off-the-air while a final farewell on-screen message card and the words "Sony Channel has ceased broadcasting in Asia. We thank you for continual support." Most of the favourite programs of Sony Channel will also be shown on AXN. On Cignal in the Philippines, its EPG slot was given to Blue Ant Entertainment.
