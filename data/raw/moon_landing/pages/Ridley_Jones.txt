Ridley Jones is an animated preschool musical fantasy television series created and executive produced by Chris Nee for Netflix. The series premiered on July 13, 2021. A second season debuted on a November 2 release. A third season was released on February 15, 2022. A fourth season was released on August 22, 2022. A fifth season was released on March 6, 2023. The series was allegedly cancelled as a reaction to the introduction of a non-binary character.


== Plot ==
The series is set in a world similar to Night at the Museum with key elements shared between the two.
The series takes place in a museum where the exhibits and displays come to life via magic. The Jones family, who live inside a treehouse at the center of the building, have been an adventurer and the latest candidate for the position is Ridley, who only recently learned about the exhibits coming to life.
As Ridley continues to earn her role, she gathers a group of other museum display models to help contain the chaos and care for those who need it, everyone is happy – without the outside world learning about the museum's secrets.


== Controversy and cancellation ==
The series generated controversy after the release of the eighth episode of the fifth season, "Happy Herd Day", in which, the main plot of the episode focuses on a bison named Fred (portrayted by Iris Menas), who is meant to lead the stampede of their herd, but has not told their grandmother that they identify as non-binary and use "they/them" pronouns. They worry about how she will react, but also do not want to lead the stampede as something they are not. In the end, with two minutes to spare, Fred informs their grandmother that they no longer go by Winnefred, identify as non-binary, and use "they/them" pronouns, and they are accepted by their grandmother for who they are. This episode angered a large number of people subscribed to the streaming platform, claiming that said episode was "LGBT indoctrination". Netflix responded to user feedback by canceling the series after its fifth and final season.
