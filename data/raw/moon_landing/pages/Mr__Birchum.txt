== Reception ==
Joel Keller in  Decider wrote, "SKIP IT. Mr. Birchum has potential to be a decent adult animated series if it gets away from the cliched Karponzi character and Birchum's fight against 'wokeness', whatever that is, and just concentrates on characters amongst his family and coworkers that are already well-developed. We just wish that part of the show was funnier." 
On Bubbleblabber, John Schwarz concluded, "Overall, Mr. Birchum embodies the spirit of what made the Birchum character likable on Crank Yankers and when he was a regular feature on KROQ-FM, but plain-jane scripting and an attempt to cater to an audience rather than try to challenge said audience falls flat, and as such, is a subpar effort to the other animated comedies Mr. Birchum attempts to emulate." 
Tyler Hummel for The Pamphleteer wrote, "Adam Carolla has a nominal amount of talent and clout left to make things happen. But given that the reaction to the show has been universally negative outside of the fanbase, it shows that Nashville's biggest conservative content creators have a long way to go."
