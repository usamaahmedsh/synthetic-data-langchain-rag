National Geographic (Nat Geo Asia, formerly NBC Asia and National Geographic Channel and also commercially abbreviated and trademarked as Nat Geo or Nat Geo TV) is a pan-Asian subscription television channel owned by Disney Networks Group Asia Pacific (through NGC Network Asia, LLC). The channel featured non-fiction, factual programming involving nature, science, culture and history, produced by the National Geographic Society, just like History and Discovery Channel.
It was launched on January 1, 1994, as NBC Asia. As of 2008, the Asian version of the original US version was available in over 56 million homes. NGC Asia has had six different channels of feeds. The channel closed in 2023–2024 as National Geographic libraries moved to the streaming platform Disney+.


== History ==


=== NBC Asia (1994–1998) ===
On January 1, 1994, the channel was officially launched as NBC Asia. It featured mostly NBC programs as well as the NBC Nightly News, The Tonight Show, Saturday Night Live and Late Night. Like its European counterpart, it could not broadcast United States-produced primetime shows due to rights restrictions. It did, however, also air some NBC Sports output. During weekday evenings, NBC Asia had a regional evening news program. It occasionally simulcast some programs from CNBC Asia and MSNBC.


=== National Geographic Asia (1998–2023) ===
On July 1, 1998, NBC Asia was rebranded as the National Geographic Channel. The NBC programming moved to CNBC Asia.
On February 4, 2008, the Nat Geo Junior programming block of two non-contingent hours, late morning and late afternoon, was launched on the channel. I Didn't Know That, Mad Labs and Wild Detectives were the initial shows on the block.


==== Closure ====
National Geographic and its sister channel Nat Geo Wild have remained on-air until the announcement of the channel closure on October 1, 2023. This announcement led many of the pay TV providers to lose all of the Disney/Fox linear channels, including National Geographic itself. However, the majority of National Geographic's libraries, including their documentary films, have been included on Disney+ (or Disney+ Hotstar in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand) content hub as Disney currently owns the partial ownership on National Geographic Global Networks.
Later on, the Taiwan feed closed down on January 1, 2024; with BBC Earth serving as its replacement.
The only Asian country that still have not ceased in operation is Japan, as the Japanese feed is currently operated by The Walt Disney Company (Japan) Ltd; both the Middle Eastern and Indian sub-continent feed is yet to be determined, while the earlier territories currently share the feed with the European/African feeds from The Walt Disney Company EMEA.
