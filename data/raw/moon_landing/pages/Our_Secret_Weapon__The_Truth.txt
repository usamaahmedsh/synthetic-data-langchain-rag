Our Secret Weapon: The Truth is a public affairs program broadcast on the DuMont Television Network from October 22, 1950, to April 17, 1951, and hosted by conservative commentators Leo Cherne and Ralph de Toledano.


== Production ==
Our Secret Weapon: The Truth had its origins in the Freedom House radio program Our Secret Weapon (1942–43), a CBS Radio series hosted by Rex Stout, which was created to counter Axis shortwave radio propaganda broadcasts during World War II.
The concept was revived during the Korean War as a weekly series that would "answer Communist lies about us" with testimony from special guests. The program featured conservative commentators Leo Cherne and Ralph de Toledano.
