Official action sought: Velmurugan has approached the Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker, M. Appavu, with an attention-seeking motion to formally raise the issue. The party has also filed a police complaint.

Comparison to other states: The Thamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi  leader has questioned why Tamil Nadu has not banned the show, claiming similar programs have been banned in states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
