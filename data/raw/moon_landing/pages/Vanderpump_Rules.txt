On March 3, 2023, a source close to production revealed that Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix had split after Madix found out Sandoval had been having an affair with Raquel Leviss.

On March 7, Leviss filed a temporary restraining order (TRO) against Scheana Shay, alleging Shay had punched her after learning of the affair.
The reunion was recorded on March 23, 2023. The TRO prohibited Shay and Leviss from being within 100 yards of one other, so they filmed at separate times.

In April 2024, the series was announced to not be filming during the summer of 2024. Bravo wanted to give the cast a break following "Scandoval" and its aftermath.  Ariana Madix's commitment to hosting season six of Love Island was rumored to have contributed to the hiatus. A filming start date was not announced at the time.
In November 2024, the series was renewed for a 12th season, with the show now being completely rebooted for the first time in the show’s history, along with an entirely new cast now replacing the previous cast members.
