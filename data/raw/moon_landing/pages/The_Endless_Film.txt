La Película Infinita (The Endless Film or The Infinite Film) is a 2018 Argentinian experimental documentary film directed by Leandro Listorti, his first feature-length work.


== Summary ==
La Película Infinita is a film essay featuring an assemblage of never completed films from the 1950s onwards from archives of a Buenos Aires film museum (for which the director is also curator), presenting an alternate parallel history of film and tracing a national cinema that never was invoking the ghosts of the country's dictatorial past.


== Films featured ==
The following films were featured in unfinished fragments:

Nicolás Sarquís’s failed 1984 adaptation of Zama (1984)
El eternauta (Hugo Gil; 1968)
La neutrónica explotó en Burzaco  (Alejandro Agresti; 1984)
Sistema español (Martín Rejtman; 1988)
El ocio (Mariano Llinás and Agustín Mendilaharzu; 1999)


== Release ==
It was released in Argentina on August 2, 2018 where it grossed $190.


== Reception ==
A review compared this assemblage of films to the "Frankenstein's method". Another review found the film was failed and "mechanical". A more appreciative assessment can be found at Desistfilm: "It is likely that everything lost at some point can have a second life, from the words that were not said to the images that were not filmed, La Película Infinita is just a sample of that videolibrary of Babel that is hidden somewhere and where all the lost cinema is kept; and we need more Listortis and Bill Morrisons that know how to show them before our eyes."
