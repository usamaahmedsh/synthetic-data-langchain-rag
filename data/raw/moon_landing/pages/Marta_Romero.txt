In 1940, when she was thirteen years old, she won the contest in a local radio station, Los aficionados de WPAB, an amateur show for performers.

Romero arrived in San Juan in 1950 and performed with a group composed, mostly, by young musicians, Los Bohemios. In 1953 she was a vocalist in the Combo de Sylvia Rexach. That same year she began her night club appearances, initially at the Vodoo Room of the Normandy Hotel as lead singer of the Joe Vallejo Combo. On radio, she became a regular singer in Revista informal  and recorded her first single in 1954 for the Puerto Rican recording company, Marvela.
