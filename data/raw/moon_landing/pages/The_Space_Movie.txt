The music for The Space Movie was produced by the English multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield who was then signed to Virgin Records. The film included pieces from Oldfield's released works, including Tubular Bells and Hergest Ridge, Ommadawn and "Portsmouth".
It also featured excerpts from what was Oldfield's then-new album, Incantations. The film also made use of the orchestral arrangements of Oldfield's first two albums, The Orchestral Tubular Bells and notably The Orchestral Hergest Ridge, which has never been released. The Space Movie soundtrack was also intended to be released as an album.
A short section of The Space Movie featuring Incantations is available as bonus material on the 1993 video collection, Elements – The Best of Mike Oldfield.
