Married at First Sight is an Australian reality television adaptation of the Danish series Gift ved første blik. The show features a group of strangers who participate in a social experiment and are paired together by experts. Due to the legal requirement to give one month's notice of marriage in Australia, participants in this installment are not legally married, instead proceeding with an unofficial commitment ceremony. The series first premiered on 18 May 2015 on the Nine Network. The show has had twelve seasons between 2015 and 2025, plus a two-part reunion special which was broadcast before the eighth season in 2021.

Couples meet for the first time at the altar, before spending their "wedding night" in a hotel and then embarking on a honeymoon. Upon return, they live together for a period of time and each week decide whether they will continue their relationship at a commitment ceremony where they can choose to either stay or leave. The experts encourage contestants to fully immerse themselves within all stages of the experiment which focuses on relationship building and companionship.

== Controversy and legality ==
Before the first season went to air, an online petition calling for the series to be axed attracted over 15,000 signatures.
Contestants have also criticised the show, such as second season participant Simone Lee Brennan described the program as "never [being] portrayed to its full authenticity," suggesting the man she had been paired with, Xavier Forsberg, had been recruited by producers and was seeking a sports-presenting role rather than a relationship.
At the show's commitment ceremonies, each contestant chooses to remain in the production or withdraw, the latter of which the contestant's partner must agree to mutually. This has been criticised as sending "the worst possible message" to people who may be in a toxic relationship. Due to interpersonal complexities in Season 10, contestants Caitlin McConville and Josh White were permitted to withdraw without input from their respective partners.
Some of the contestants of the show have also spoken out against the program claiming it to be fake, including Dean Wells from Season 5. Other former contestants have been abused in the street, received death threats online, attempted suicide, or been taken to a psychiatric hospital.
