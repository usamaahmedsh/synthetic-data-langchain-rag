Ethiopian News Network (ENN TV) was an Ethiopian television channel based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The channel was launched in 2016 on Nilesat. It was the first private station based in Ethiopia to be focused on news and politics outside of the national broadcaster EBC. ENN TV faced criticisms by several organizations for alleged use of misinformation and propaganda manipulation which led the channel to official closure on June 29, 2018.
