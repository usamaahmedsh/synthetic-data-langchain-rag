Filmlovers! is Arnaud Desplechin's fifteenth feature film and is an essay film in homage to cinema. It features the character of Paul Dédalus, who is considered Desplechin's alter-ego and who first appeared in his film My Sex Life... or How I Got into an Argument (1996) and its prequels A Christmas Tale (2008) and My Golden Days (2015). In Filmlovers!, he returns to the character's childhood, and tells the story of how he got introduced to cinema: first as a spectator, then as a cinephile, and finally a filmmaker. The film is a hybrid of documentary and fiction that incorporates archival footage of film clips and stills as well as interviews with those who accompanied Desplechin in his experiences as a spectator. Ranging from Hollywood blockbusters to Italian neorealism, from the silent era to contemporary cinema, the film is a journey through the images that shaped Desplechin's filmmaking. Desplechin wrote the film's screenplay, in collaboration with Fanny Burdino. He also cited Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical film The Fabelmans (2022) as a source of inspiration. The film was produced by Charles Gillibert at CG Cinéma. It was co-produced by Scala Films, Arte France Cinéma and Hill Valley, with the participation of French fashion house Chanel.
Principal photography began on 17 July 2023 in Avion, Pas-de-Calais, where shooting took place for two days at the cinema Le Familia, which was transformed to resemble the 1960s and 1970s. Filming continued that same week in Roubaix and Tourcoing. Desplechin planned to shoot sequences in his former high school, in which a multimedia room bears his name. Filming then moved to Paris.
