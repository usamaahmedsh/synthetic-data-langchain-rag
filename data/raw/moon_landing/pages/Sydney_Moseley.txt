As an author, The Bookseller's reviews for August 1921 stated,

"[T]hose who have read his previous books know well Mr. Moseley possesses exceptional powers of vivid description and forceful writing. He can make his readers see the various scenes and incidents almost as if with his own eyes, and the artistic skill with which he emphasises the salient features or contrasts effectively one scene with another is in evidence on every page."
