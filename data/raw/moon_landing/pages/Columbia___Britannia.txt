== Setting ==
The Point of divergence occurs in 1766, when William Pitt proposes the Columbia Compromise, a set of laws that serves to establish a framework for North American representation in Parliament. The American Revolutionary War never takes place and British North America becomes an integral part of an expanding British Empire. Each of the anthology's stories is set against a significant historical occurrence along this timeline, exploring the effects of events including, among others, the publication of Thomas Paine's Common Sense, a Southern revolt against the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, the English Decadent movement, New York's British Empire Exhibition, a British Moon landing, and the War of Wars fought between the United Kingdom and Germany.
