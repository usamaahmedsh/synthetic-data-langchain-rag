The full house design was revealed on March 1, with most of the house being similar to the season 8 superhero themed house, but with decorative fake vines and overgrowth covering large portions of the house. The bathroom, the HoH bedroom the outdoor spa area, and the Expedia-themed lounge room remained the same as last season. Of the few rooms to be completely redesigned was the main bedrooms, which were redecorated to correspond the theme of each team. The swamp themed Have-Not room was replaced by a ball-pit. Additionally, there was no nomination room, with the space normally taken by the nomination room being used as a OLG themed games room.

== Format ==

Big Brother Canada follows a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests who move into a custom-built house outfitted with cameras and microphones, recording their every move 24 hours a day. The HouseGuests are sequestered in the Big Brother Canada House with no contact with the outside world. During their stay, the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other HouseGuests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room. At the start of each week in the house, the HouseGuests compete for the title of Head of Household, often shortened to simply HoH. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will name two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. After the nominees are determined, the Power of Veto competition is played. Five players will compete in the competition: the two nominees and three random players, with the winner receiving the Power of Veto. If a HouseGuest chooses to exercise the Power of Veto, the Head of Household is obligated to name a replacement nominee. The holder of the Power of Veto is safe from being nominated as the replacement nominee. On eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. The eviction vote is by secret ballot, with HouseGuests casting their votes orally in the Diary Room. In the event of a tied vote, the Head of Household will cast a tie-breaking vote publicly. The nominee with the majority of the votes is evicted from the house. Midway through the season, the evicted HouseGuests go on to become members of the "jury"; the jury is responsible for choosing who wins the series. The final Head of Household competition is split into three parts; the winners of the first two rounds compete in the third and final round. Once only two HouseGuests remain, the members of the jury cast their votes for who should win the series.

=== Team twist ===
For the first time in Big Brother Canada, the HouseGuests will compete in two teams (known as Team Destiny & Team Defender). The teams were selected by Team Captains determined by Canada's Vote, which opened as the cast was revealed. The Captains are also awarded immunity for the first week. For the duration of the teams phase the Head of Household would win immunity for their entire team. The draft for the teams was as follows:

== Have-Nots ==
At the start of each week, a group of HouseGuests are selected to become the Have-Nots for the week. Those selected to be the Have-Nots are restricted to a slop diet and cold showers, and are required to sleep in an uncomfortable room. Each week, a "Skip the Slop" online public vote is held. The winner of the vote (indicated by strikethrough) will receive a free meal from SkipTheDishes and have their Have-Not status nullified for the remainder of the week. The vote was held every week where Have-Nots were named, with the exception of Week 5.
