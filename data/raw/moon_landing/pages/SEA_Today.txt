SEA Today (abbreviation from Southeast Asia Today) was an Indonesian English-language news and lifestyle television channel targeting Southeast Asian and international audiences. Launched on 28 October 2020 in conjunction with Indonesia's Youth Pledge Day, the channel was owned by PT Metra Digital Media (MD Media), a subsidiary of the state-owned telecommunication company Telkom Indonesia.
SEA Today aired through IndiHome's IPTV service UseeTV and MNC Vision's DTH Service in Indonesia since September 2022 and StarHub TV Singapore's IPTV Services.


== History ==
The channel began on-air in November 2018 as .idKU, a 24-hour documentary and lifestyle channel. A UseeTV (now IndiHome TV) exclusive in-house channel, .idKU was intended as "a place for state-owned enterprises, governments (both central and local) and private businesses as well as small enterprises to deliver positive messages about inspiring Indonesian works through exciting, entertaining, and educating television programs".
On 28 October 2020, .idKU was replaced by SEA Today at 7:20pm Jakarta time after the final programme of .idKU 100% Indonesia music show. In their launching, SEA Today was inaugurated by the Minister of State Owned Enterprises at the time, Erick Thohir.
SEA Today had transmitted via a SEA Today-owned transponder Telkom-4 108°2E for its Indonesia and Southeast Asian coverage.
In February 2025, PT Metra Digital Media, the owner of SEA Today, announced plans for internal layoffs. Several months later, SEA Today ceased broadcasting on 30 June 2025, with its final broadcast being Autoday, cut off shortly before its final sign-off.
