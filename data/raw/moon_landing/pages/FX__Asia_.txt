FX was an Asian pay-television entertainment channel, owned and operated by Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific, a subsidiary of Disney International Operations. It was launched on November 3, 2008.
In India, the channel was replaced by an Indian localised feed in September 2012; however, some TV providers continue to distribute the Asian feed.
In South Korea, Tcast, the licensor for the Fox channels in the country, announced on December 31, 2020 that it had terminated its license agreement with The Walt Disney Company Korea renaming its channels. FX in that region would become MX.
FX along with most of The Walt Disney Company channels across Southeast Asia and Hong Kong (Fox Crime, Fox, Fox Life, Disney Junior, Disney Channel, Nat Geo People, Fox Movies, Fox Action Movies, Fox Family Movies, Star Movies China, SCM Legend, Channel [V], and five of its sports channels) ceased broadcasting on 1 September 2021 in Hong Kong and a month later in Southeast Asia. Most of these channels' shows moved to Disney+ (in Singapore, Philippines, Hong Kong and Taiwan) and Disney+ Hotstar (in Southeast Asia outside Singapore and Philippines).
