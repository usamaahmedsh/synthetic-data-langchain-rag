Moonwalk, officially Barangay Moonwalk, is an urban barangay located in the second district of Parañaque, Philippines. As of the 2024 census, the population was 71,860. The barangay was created on April 3, 1978.


== History ==
The area that is Moonwalk today was once part of a barrio called Pulu, which was shown in a map published in 1885 during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines. Its land was used in agriculture and salt making. Moonwalk was created on April 3, 1978, after then-President Ferdinand Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 1321 that would detach the subdivisions Moonwalk Phase I and II, Bricktown Phase 1, 2, and 3, and Multinational Village from Barangay Sto. Niño to form an independent barangay. The barangay's name was based on Moonwalk subdivision, which itself was named after the Moon landing mission of Apollo 11. When then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act No. 9229 in December 2003 to divide Parañaque into two congressional districts, the barangay became part of the newly formed second district.


== Geography ==
Moonwalk has a total land area of 401.01 hectares. It has four adjacent barangays: Merville on the northeast, Don Bosco on the east, San Isidro on the southeast, San Dionisio on the southwest, and Sto. Niño  on the northwest.
