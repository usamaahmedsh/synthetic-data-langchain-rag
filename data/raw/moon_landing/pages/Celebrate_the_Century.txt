Celebrate the Century is a series of postage stamps made by the United States Postal Service featuring images recalling various important events in the 20th century in the United States. Ten of these sheets were issued, with each sheet depicting events of one decade of the 20th century, from the 1900s to 1990s. Fifteen stamps were embedded into each sheet. For the first eight sheets (1900s to 1970s) of the fifteen stamps, one stamp of each sheet was printed using the intaglio process, while the remaining fourteen were offset printed along with the rest of the sheet. All the sheets were printed by the Ashton-Potter USA printing company.


== Format ==
These gummed souvenir sheets had an unusually large format of 7½"x9" (190mmx229mm). The top left hand corner sported the decade in a number format, the entire background of the sheet was devoted a specific event of that decade (e.g. the Wright brothers standing next to their Flyer II on the 1900s sheet.)
The fifteen stamps were printed at an angle of 8°, the horizontal perforations ran from the stamps up to the edge of sheet. The stamps were arranged on the sheets in four rows, and nested in arrangements unique to each sheet. An area was devoted to the description of the decade as depicted by the stamps on it. The description of each stamp was printed on the gummed side of the sheet, behind each stamp.
The words Arts, Sports, Historical Events ran on the left hand edge, Technology, Entertainment,  Science ran on the top edge, Political Figures, Life Style on the right hand edge of the sheet.
The stamp images for the first five sheets were selected by Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee and those for the remaining five sheets were selected by a nationwide poll.


== CTC Express ==

The CTC stamp program was publicised through an award-winning travelling railway museum tour, named Celebrate the Century Express commissioned by the USPS consisting of a locomotive and three cars. This train travelled for eighteen months from 11 March 1999 through fall 19 November 2000 throughout the continental US to showcase the mail to the US public. During its journey it travelled through 100 cities in 42 states and had more than 111,000 visitors including 6,000 children. The CTC Express consisted of an Amtrak P42 Genesis series diesel locomotive, an exhibit car featuring multimedia displays of US commemorative stamps, a restored Railway Mail Service car, a historic railroad business car, and a baggage car. The CTC Express received the U.S. Transportation Department's "Design for Transportation National Awards 2000," and the "TRANNY Award of Excellence" from the Transportation Marketing and Communications Association. On 25 May 2000 the US Congress commended the USPS for receiving these awards.


== CTC Education Series ==
The USPS with the US Department of Education and ten of the  leading K–12 educational associations, started the education program involving more than 300,000  students across the U.S. in a comprehensive, in-class curriculum program which would take students on a field trip through the decades of the 20th century.
The program kits were created for students from grades 3 to 6, and was available to teachers free of charge. Each kit included a teacher's guide, a student activity magazine, computer activities, internet linked sites, multimedia classroom visuals,
school balloting for students and take home projects for children for parental participation. In a survey taken in 1999 of 20,000 educators, it was revealed that the program was a big success.

In 1999, the U.S. Postal Service honored Secretariat with a 33-cent U.S. postage stamp entitled "Secretariat Wins Triple Crown" in the Celebrate the Century (1970s) series. The national unveiling ceremony was held in the winner's circle at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Kentucky on Saturday, October 16, 1999. On Thursday, November 18, 1999, the First Day of Issue ceremony was held at the Postage Stamp Mega-event at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, New York. The stamp was issued to celebrate Secretariat and his iconic 1973 Triple Crown victory. The following text is in the packet: “Secretariat Wins Triple Crown" – In 1972, two-year-old Secretariat was named Horse of the Year. In 1973, he won the coveted Triple Crown, including the only less-than-two-minute Kentucky Derby victory and a 31-length Belmont Stakes triumph."
The stamp is among those listed in the Smithsonian Institution's record of exhibitions called, "Trailblazers and Trendsetters: Art of the Stamp: Sports." The description about the Secretariat stamp reads as follows: “Affectionately known as "Big Red," Secretariat was a sturdy, chestnut-colored thoroughbred who made his racing debut on July 4, 1972. He won five contests that year and was named Horse of the Year. In 1973, Secretariat became the first horse in 25 years to win the coveted Triple Crown. In May of that year, he ran the Kentucky Derby in less than two minutes, the fastest finish ever recorded at the prestigious race. The colt then went on to win the Preakness Stakes and, in June, the Belmont Stakes, which he won by a triumphant 31 lengths.” The description includes this information about the artwork: “Artist: Kazuhiko Sano; Art Director: Howard Paine; Medium: Acrylic on Gesso Board; and Year of Issue: 1999.”  The painted image looks like an exact copy of the painting on the cover of the June 11, 1973 (Vol. 101, No. 24) issue of TIME Magazine. The stamp was in a collection called Celebrate the Century (1970).
Issued on November 18, 1999, the Secretariat stamp is on the left side of the third row of the sheet of 15 stamps celebrating the 1970s entitled: Bicentennial, Watergate, and Earth Day. The stamps pictured in the first row of the information packet were entitled: Earth Day; All in the Family (TV series); and Sesame Street (with Big Bird from the TV series). The second row has stamps for: Disco; Pittsburgh Steelers; and the United States Bicentennial. “Secretariat – Horse of the Year” is in the third row, along with the Videocassette recorder, Pioneer 10; the Women's Rights Movement by UNIFEM; and 1970s fashion. In the fourth row is: ABC's Monday Night Football; Smiley face; the Boeing 747; and Medical imaging. While Watergate is in the title of the series, the scandal is not represented on any stamps in the collection. The Celebrate the Century stamps are available online, but not from the Post Office.
