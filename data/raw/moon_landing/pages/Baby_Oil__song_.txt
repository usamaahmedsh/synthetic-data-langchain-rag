"Baby Oil" is a 2024 song by Nigerian-American artist Speed Darlington. Released in October 2024, the song attracted significant attention, with fans and critics interpreting it as a satirical response to controversies involving prominent figures in the music industry, including Burna Boy and American rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs. The release of "Baby Oil" followed a highly publicized series of events, including Darlington's detainment by the Nigerian police, reportedly connected to Burna Boy's legal actions against him.


== Background and release ==
The origins of "Baby Oil" trace back to Darlington's public comments about Burna Boy's Grammy win for his 2021 album Twice as Tall, which was co-executive produced by American rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs. In his remarks, Darlington insinuated that Burna Boy's association with Diddy, who was then facing legal issues—including allegations of sexual misconduct, that led authorities to seize over 1,000 bottles of baby oil from his properties—might have influenced his Grammy win. Darlington's comments ignited a public debate, and the tension between the two artists escalated when Darlington posted a video mocking the alleged excesses in the music industry, specifically referencing baby oil as a satirical nod to Diddy's alleged stockpile of the product. These comments, along with his video, caught widespread attention online and reportedly led to legal actions.
Following the video's release, Darlington mysteriously disappeared from the public eye, sparking concern and speculation among fans and social media observers. It was later revealed that Darlington had been detained by the Nigeria Police Force's Intelligence Response Team in Abuja on charges of defamation and cyberstalking. Sources indicate that Burna Boy played a role in initiating the defamation complaint against Darlington, while Burna Boy's mother, Bose Ogulu, was reportedly involved in facilitating the legal process. The involvement of Burna Boy's mother, who also serves as his manager, added another layer of public interest and scrutiny to the unfolding events.
Darlington's arrest and detainment led to further public outcry, with his supporters arguing that his satirical commentary should not warrant such legal actions and after several days, he was granted bail and released. Upon his release, Darlington issued a public apology, asserting that his prior statements were meant as humor rather than defamation. Despite his apology, the feud did not subside, and Darlington decided to channel his frustration and response into his music, leading to the creation of "Baby Oil". In an interview, Darlington stated that he wanted to use the song to highlight what he perceived as "industry hypocrisy" and the lengths some artists go to maintain a polished public image.


== Music video ==
The official music video for "Baby Oil" was released shortly after the song's debut. Directed by Speed Darlington himself, the video features contemptuous and symbolic imagery that aligns with the song's themes. Notably, it includes scenes where Darlington is depicted in a prison setting, asserting dominance over fellow inmates, which critics have interpreted as a commentary on his resilience and defiance in the face of legal and industry challenges.
The video has been praised for its creative direction and its ability to visually encapsulate the song's satirical narrative.

"Baby Oil" quickly gained traction on streaming platforms, particularly on Spotify, where it became one of the highest new entries on the platform's daily top chart. Fans and critics praised the track for its bold commentary, noting Darlington's unique approach to addressing sensitive industry issues. According to Within Nigeria, the song's viral success highlighted Darlington's impact on Nigerian pop culture, despite his relatively independent and often controversial approach to music. The public feud and his arrest have been considered key factors in the song's popularity, as listeners and fans engaged in social media debates regarding the ethics of public criticisms and the consequences of industry conflicts.
