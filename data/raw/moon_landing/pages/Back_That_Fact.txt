== Game play ==
At the beginning of the show, a panel of judges was chosen from members of the studio audience. Adams interviewed members of the audience about their life, family, job, hobbies and other parts of their background. If at any time during the interview the contestant made a positive assertion on an answer, Caruso interrupted to ask the player to "Back That Fact". At that point, the player would attempt to prove, to the best of their ability, that the assertion was true.  The judges would then decide if the player successfully justified or verified their explanation.  If the judges agreed, the player won a modest prize. If not, the player lost the game and another player is interviewed.
Two or three audience members were chosen to be interviewed during the course of the show.
