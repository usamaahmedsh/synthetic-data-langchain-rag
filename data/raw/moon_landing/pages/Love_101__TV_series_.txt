Back in 1998, a group of young people (Eda, Osman, Sinan, and Kerem) studying in a school of Istanbul are at risk of expulsion because of their poor behavior. They are very different from their classmates, therefore, very lonely. The headmaster and most of the teachers are against them, only one teacher by the name of Burcu (Pınar Deniz) does her best to protect the teenagers. However, they find out that Burcu will be relocated, which means that all of them would be expelled after her relocation. In order to prevent this, the students unite and make a plan. The students discover that according to the law, she can choose the place of work by herself if she is married. They decide that they will try to make Burcu fall in love with the new sports teacher, Kemal (Kaan Urgancıoğlu), so that she can stay in Istanbul. Soon enough they discover that Burcu is already in a "happy" relationship and that it won't be easy to make her stay. They ask for help from Işık (İpek Filiz Yazıcı), an excellent student and a girl with a big heart. Soon she becomes a part of their group. This union helps the students change for the better, understand themselves, realize the importance of true friendship, find love and their own way in life.
