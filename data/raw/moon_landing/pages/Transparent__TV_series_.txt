Transparent is an American comedy-drama television series created by Joey Soloway for Amazon Studios that debuted on February 6, 2014. The story revolves around a Los Angeles family, the Pfeffermans, and their lives after learning that their parent (Jeffrey Tambor) is a trans woman now going by the name Maura. Transparent's first season premiered in full on September 26, 2014, and its second season on December 11, 2015, third season on September 23, 2016, and fourth season on September 21, 2017.
The final season ultimately took the form of a feature-length finale with the subtitle Musicale Finale, which was released on September 27, 2019.
Critical reviews were largely positive, though there were objections to the casting of Tambor, a cisgender man, in the role of a trans woman. At the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, the show won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy, while Tambor won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. This is the first show produced by Amazon Studios to win a major award and the first show produced by a streaming media service to win a Golden Globe for Best Series.
The series began airing on Sundance TV starting August 9, 2017.
In November 2017, Tambor was accused of sexual harassment on the set. On November 19, 2017, Tambor stated, "I don't see how I can return to Transparent" after a second sexual harassment allegation was made against him. He was officially fired from Transparent on February 15, 2018.
The Transparent: Musicale Finale addressed the death of Maura, and examined the lives of the Pfefferman family primarily from perspective of Maura's former spouse, Shelly (Judith Light), and through music. The Finale, featuring music and lyrics by Faith Soloway, was developed through a series of concerts at Joe's Pub and, in addition to the regular and recurring cast, featured performers Shakina Nayfack, Lesli Margherita, Erik Liberman, and Jo Lampert.
In 2023, the show was adapted into a stage musical, A Transparent Musical, for the Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles. The book was written by showrunner Joey Soloway and transgender playwright MJ Kaufman, with music and lyrics by Faith Soloway, Joey's sister. The production received mixed reviews.

== Background ==
Soloway felt inspired to create Transparent after their parent came out as trans. They created the pilot for Amazon.com, which became available for free streaming and download on February 6, 2014 as part of Amazon's second pilot season. Amazon Studios picked up the pilot for Transparent in March, 2014, ordering a ten-episode season.
Tambor had previously portrayed transvestite judge Alan Wachtel on the police procedural television show Hill Street Blues in the 1980s. Soloway wrote Hoffmann's role after seeing her performance on Season 3 of Louis C.K.'s show Louie.
Transparent premiered all ten episodes simultaneously in late September 2014. In Canada, where Amazon's video streaming service was not available, the series premiered on the Shomi platform on January 23, 2015.


== Religious themes ==
The series depicts several Jewish characters and deals with spiritually and culturally Jewish themes. Joey Soloway, the series' primary creator, is Jewish and consulted Rabbi Susan Goldberg of Wilshire Boulevard Temple. They also sought advice from Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie of New York.


== Production ==
Soloway said that they hoped to use the series to explore ideas of gender identity through a "wounded parent being replaced by a blossoming femininity" and that they pictured Tambor as Maura when writing the character.
Soloway, the writers, and the cast developed, workshopped, and rehearsed both seasons with consulting producer Joan Scheckel at Joan Scheckel Filmmaking Labs.
As part of the making of the show, Soloway enacted a "transfirmative action program", whereby trans applicants were hired in preference to non-trans ones. Over eighty trans people worked on the show, including Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst, trans consultants and co-producers. Despite this, the main character Maura was played by Tambor, a man. In 2014, when the show debuted, Soloway defended their casting choice, citing Tambor’s “ability to embody a sort of very dignified feminine way of being.” However, in 2016, Soloway recanted this perspective, saying that casting a man as a trans woman is unacceptable and that no one should make the same casting decision again, citing such a decision as an "insult" to trans women.
In 2014, Our Lady J was chosen as the first openly trans person to be a writer for the show. All the bathrooms on set were gender-neutral.
The original pilot made available in February 2014 (with Gillian Vigman in the role of Tammy) was partly reshot after the series was approved.
On November 19, 2017, Tambor quit the show amidst sexual harassment allegations made against him.

Alan Sepinwall from HitFix named Transparent the best new show of the Fall 2014 season and Amazon's "most impressive volley yet". He added:"... [The] show looks gorgeous and displays an instant command of both tone and this particular pocket of life in Los Angeles; Soloway is incredibly confident in introducing us to the parts of the show that are more universally relatable (a marriage gone sour, a disappointing child), knowing that we'll then follow her into more unfamiliar territory—not just with Maura, but the many disreputable behaviors her kids get tangled up in."
