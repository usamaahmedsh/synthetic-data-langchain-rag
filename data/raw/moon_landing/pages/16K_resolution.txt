The most commonly discussed 16K resolution as of 2025, is 15360 × 8640, which doubles the pixel count of 8K UHD in each dimension, for a total of four times as many pixels. This resolution has 132.7 megapixels, 16 times as many pixels as 4K resolution and 64 times as many pixels as 1080p resolution.  
As of May 2025, 16K resolutions can be run in prototype displays, large public displays or using multi-monitor setups with AMD Eyefinity, or Nvidia Surround or Mosaic Technology.

In early 2014, Japanese companies Nest+Visual, Sony and Indy Associates produced the first 16K film, using a Sony F65 CineAlta camera equipped with an anamorphic lens. The film was presented in March 2014 on a multi-screen video display at the Tokyo International Airport in Haneda, Japan.

In 2018, US filmmaker Martin Lisius released a short time-lapse film titled, "Prairie Wind" that he produced using a 2-camera Canon EOS 5DS system he developed. Two still images were stitched together to create one 15985 × 5792 pixel image and then rendered as 16K resolution video with an extremely wide aspect ratio of 2.76∶1. This is among the first known 16K videos to exist.
