Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project is a 2019 American documentary film directed by Matt Wolf about Marion Stokes and the television news archive she created.


== Summary ==
Stokes captured 840,000 hours of news footage over the course of 35 years, from 1977 until her death in 2012; the VHS and Betamax video recordings were donated to the Internet Archive.
The Iran hostage crisis, which lasted from 1979 to 1981, made Stokes decide to make her project a round-the-clock job due to its continuous development as it happened.

A book featuring imagery compiled by Wolf from more than seven hundred hours of Stokes's tapes, titled Input, was published in Fall of 2023.
The film has a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The site's critical consensus reads, "Recorder: The Marion Stokes Story uses one person's singular quest to illuminate the blurred line between brilliance and obsession."
