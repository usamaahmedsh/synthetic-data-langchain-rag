As of October 13, 2025, the SpaceX Starship has been launched 11 times, with 6 successes and 5 failures. The American company has developed Starship with the intention of lowering launch costs using economies of scale. It aims to achieve this by reusing both rocket stages, increasing payload mass to orbit, increasing launch frequency, creating a mass-manufacturing pipeline and adapting it to a wide range of space missions. Starship is the latest project in SpaceX's reusable launch system development program and plan to colonize Mars, and also one of two landing systems selected by NASA for the Artemis program's crewed Lunar missions. 
SpaceX calls the entire launch vehicle "Starship", which consists of the Super Heavy first stage (booster) and the ambiguously-named Starship second stage (ship). There are four versions of the Starship vehicle: Block 1, (also known as Starship 1, Version 1, or V1) which is retired,  Block 2, which first flew in Starship flight test 7 and was retired after Starship flight test 11, Block 3, and Block 4, with the latter two in development. As of October 13, 2025, 6 Block 1 vehicles and 5 Block 2 vehicles have flown; with the last Block 1 launch occurring in November 2024 (Starship flight test 6). Both Starship's first and second stages are planned to be reusable, and are planned to be caught by the tower arms used to assemble the rocket at the pad. This capability was first demonstrated during Starship's fifth flight test, using a Block 1 booster.

In a talk in November 2024, Starbase General Manager Kathy Lueders announced that SpaceX hoped to be able to catch a Starship upper stage sometime in the next 6 months and have as many as 25 launches in 2025. This did not occur. Starship was launched just five times by mid-October, with no planned launches during the remaining months of 2025.
