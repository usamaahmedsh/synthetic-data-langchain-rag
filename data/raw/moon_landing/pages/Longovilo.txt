== Satellite Communications Ground Station ==

In 1968, the telecommunications company Entel built the first satellite telecommunication ground station in Latin America in Longovilo. The station was officially inaugurated on 9 August 1968 in a ceremony presided over by President Eduardo Frei Montalva, marking a major milestone in the history of telecommunications in Chile.
The facility also gained significant public notoriety in 1969, when it enabled the live broadcast of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, making Chile the first country in Latin America to receive the transmission. On July 20 of that year, a Sunday, President Frei decreed a national holiday until noon on Monday so that as many Chileans as possible could watch the event live without interruption.
