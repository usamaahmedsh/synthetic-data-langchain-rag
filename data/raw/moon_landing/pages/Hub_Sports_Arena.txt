Hub Sports Arena, formerly SuperSports Arena, was a Singaporean television sports channel operated by StarHub, available on StarHub TV. It broadcast coverage of sporting events such as Lions 12 (M-League) and S-League.
The channel was a free channel and came to be in October 2013 due to an agreement between StarHub and Singapore Sports Council; the channel was launched on 10 October 2013. Thanks to a partnership with the S-League, the channel started airing its matches in 2016.
Hub Sports Arena ceased transmission on 28 December 2018, shortly before analogue broadcasts in Singapore were turned off.
