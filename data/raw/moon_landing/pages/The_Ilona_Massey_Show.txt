The Ilona Massey Show is a DuMont Television Network variety show hosted by actress Ilona Massey and featuring musician Irving Fields. Massey sang on a set built to resemble a nightclub. The show aired Mondays from November 1, 1954, to January 3, 1955, for a total of ten episodes.
The show initially was broadcast on Mondays from 8 to 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time. In January 1955 it was moved to Wednesdays from 8:30 to 9 p.m. E. T. 
George Paley was the show's first producer and writer; he was replaced by Sherry Cloth in December 1954. Pat Fay was the director. 


== Episode status ==
As with many DuMont series, no episodes are known to exist.


== Critical response ==
A review of the premiere episode in the trade publication Variety said that the show "would be palatable for 15-minute dosages" but that in the existing half-hour format it was "stretched to the point of monotony".
