== Controversies ==
In November 2023, S. Somanath’s Malayalam memoir Nilavu Kudicha Simhangal (“The lions that guzzled the moonlight”) drew media attention after excerpts from the book reportedly contained remarks about his predecessor, former ISRO Chairman K. Sivan, and events surrounding the Chandrayaan-2 mission. Following the controversy, Somanath announced that he was withdrawing the book from publication, clarifying that it was not intended to criticise any individual or organisation.
Earlier in August 2023, Somanath’s public comments distinguishing science and belief, made during discussions about naming the Chandrayaan-3 landing site “Shiv Shakti Point,” also received mixed reactions on social media and in sections of the press. In September 2024, the Breakthrough Science society (BSS), a voluntary organisation promoting scientific temper and rational thinking, raised objections to ISRO Chairman Somanath'sremarks praising the role of Sanskrit in India’s emergence as a knowledge society since Vedic times. The organisation stated that such claims promote a “mythological view of history” and blur the distinction between scientific reasoning and cultural belief. The statement by BSS called for separating scientific achievements from religious or linguistic traditions to preserve the objectivity of science.
In July 2024, The New Indian Express reported that a group of senior ISRO scientists had raised complaints about alleged unfairness in promotions and extensions of service within the organisation. The report cited claims of “discrimination” and “caste and regional considerations” influencing key administrative decisions, including the granting of two-year extensions to a few directors while others received only one-year terms. Some scientists alleged that certain appointments and promotions favoured individuals said to be close to senior officials. The news paper also reported that one person, a “close friend” of a top official, was promoted unfairly.
