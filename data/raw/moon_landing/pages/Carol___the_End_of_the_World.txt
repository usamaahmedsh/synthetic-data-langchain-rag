Carol & the End of the World (stylized as carol & the end of the world) is an American adult animated comedy drama television miniseries created by Dan Guterman for Netflix. Produced by Bardel Entertainment, it was released on December 15, 2023.
The series is based on the premise of planetary collisions. The planet Earth is about to collide with the fictional planet Keppler, and human extinction is inevitable. Most humans attempt to fulfil their lifelong dreams before they die. But the former secretary Carol Kohl instead finds a way to pass time by joining a group of office workers who crunch numbers for products that seemingly don't exist. 
The series featured Kimberly Hébert Gregory's final television role before her death in 2025.


== Premise ==
With a mysterious planet hurtling towards Earth, extinction is imminent for the people of the world. While most feel liberated to pursue their wildest dreams, one quiet and awkward woman, Carol, stands alone—lost among the hedonistic masses.
Director Dan Guterman described the show as "a love letter to routine. A show about the comforts of monotony. An animated existential comedy about the daily rituals that make up the gaps that make up a life."
