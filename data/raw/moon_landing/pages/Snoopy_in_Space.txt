== Production ==
In December 2018, DHX Media announced that it would be producing new Peanuts material for Apple's then unnamed streaming service, starting with the animated Snoopy in Space. Months prior, Peanuts Worldwide announced a partnership with NASA to promote STEM to students through new content.
The Snoopy character had a history with the space agency dating back to the 1969 Apollo 10 mission. In the buildup to the show's release, Apple TV began streaming a documentary by Morgan Neville titled Peanuts in Space: Secrets of Apollo 10. Starring Ron Howard and Jeff Goldblum, the short was released in May 2019. Through the NASA partnership, the series uses live-action footage from the NASA archives.
Snoopy in Space debuted alongside the launch of Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019. DHX released the show's soundtrack to stream on Apple Music the same day.
The show was the last DHX show to be produced under the DHX Media name, before the studio would change its name to WildBrain to build upon its multi-channel network of the same name, which was subsequently renamed to "WildBrain Spark".
In October 2020, it was announced that a second season is in production. The second season premiered on November 12, 2021.

An astronaut Snoopy character balloon also flew in the 2019 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Space Foundation began hosting STEM lessons prior to the show's release. Apple Store locations launched Snoopy in Space-themed events alongside the series' debut.


== Reception ==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Snoopy in Space holds an approval rating of 100% based on 6 reviews, with an average score 8/10. In a positive review for Common Sense Media, Mandie Caroll praised the show's handling of the educational aspects, though she warned that older fans might miss the "gloomy" situations of traditional Peanuts stories. Decider's Joel Keller felt that the deeper aspects of Peanuts were missing, but still recommended the series to fans of Snoopy and space exploration. iMore's Lory Gil also noticed the lack of bite compared to earlier Peanuts specials, though she felt it still offered a good update for modern audiences.
