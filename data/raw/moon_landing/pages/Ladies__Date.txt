== Overview ==
An audience-participation program, Ladies' Date included party games and stunts with features such as "Pen Pusher's Parade", "Notable Neighbor", "Lady for a Day", and "Ideal Mother-in-Law".

Meet the Ladies, a program that Mayer wrote and produced in Detroit, was the basis for Ladies' Date. It began on radio and then was televised, and it was the most popular daytime program in the Detroit area. When he moved to WABD-TV in New York, he sent 2,500 letters to organizations to invite women to participate in the new program.
Ladies' Date was broadcast from WABD. The program aired Monday through Friday from 1pm to 1:30pm ET from October 13, 1952, to July 31, 1953. Sandy Howard was the producer, and Jim Saunders was the director.
