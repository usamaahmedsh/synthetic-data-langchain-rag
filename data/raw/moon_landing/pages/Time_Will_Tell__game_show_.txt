Time Will Tell is an early American game show that aired on the DuMont Television Network Fridays at 10:30 pm ET from August 27 to October 15, 1954. The host was Ernie Kovacs. Don Russell was the announcer, and Eddie Hatrak provided music.
Game play involved three contestants answering questions in 90-second rounds, timed with a large hourglass.
The sustaining program, produced and distributed by the network, aired on most DuMont affiliates on Fridays at 10:30 pm Eastern Time, replacing Gamble on Love which was also hosted by Kovacs in the same time slot. After Time Will Tell ended, DuMont replaced the series with local (non-network) programming.


== Episode status ==
DuMont, like NBC and CBS during the 1950s, probably kept at least one or two "example" episodes of each of its main game shows, though DuMont's exact policy is not known. However, DuMont's archive was destroyed after the network ceased broadcasting in 1956. Although a small number of DuMont game show episodes are known to exist in various archives, none are known to exist of either Time will Tell nor Gamble on Love.
