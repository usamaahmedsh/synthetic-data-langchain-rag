== Format ==
Set in Salt Lake City, Utah, the one-hour special depicted four Mormon men—Jeff, Pret, Curtis, and Tom—who, while only attracted to men, are married to or seeking a relationship with women.


== Production ==
TLC said that the couples depicted in the special "reveal the decisions they have made and speak only for themselves."


== Reception ==
A Change.org petition drew over 100,000 supporters to ask TLC to pull the program because, "TLC is ... sending the message that being gay is something that can and ought to be changed, or that you should reject your sexual orientation by marrying someone of the opposite sex." Objectors stated that by airing a television special about this belief, TLC was implicitly endorsing it, a form of bigotry.
My Husband's Not Gay drew sharp criticism from advocacy groups, including the media monitoring organizations GLAAD and Truth Wins Out (TWO).
