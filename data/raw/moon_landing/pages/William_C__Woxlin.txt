== Career ==
He started out as a solo pianist in 1994 (then 6 years old) playing at different events and later he started to take piano lessons. Later he became a part of Super Synth Farmacia, a group which made songs on computers and toy keyboards, later in 2002 they disbanded. He was also a member in a music collective called Borlange All-Stars. In 2006 Borlange All-Stars disbanded because they couldn't find anything more to express through their music. In 2008 he released his new solo album, Reality After Midnight, after working with it for almost one year; it was later released on iTunes. The last single of the album, Devil May Care, featured Tess and was released on Spotify, 20 August 2009.
About his work as a director he've commented that: "As a director you have to dignify the playwrights' script and also express your own artistic expression on the stage [...] and also not constrain the actors in their progress."


=== Sywnthkrawft ===
In 2005 Woxlin decided to create the band Sywnthkrawft together with Gustav Jacobsson, Viktor Jacobsson and Daniel Thyberg. Between 2005 and 2007, they released three albums and three singles.
Although their initial sound was ambient inspired, Sywnthkrawft soon switched to a more instrumental synthpop influenced sound. They gained some success with the single, The Photographer's Exceptional Pictures for Body and Mind. On 8 March 2007, it debuted on #1 on the Swedish chart Dalatoppen and held its position for 7 weeks. Their last album, Goodbye, Spaceblade (Re-recorded), were released only weeks before they embarked on a hiatus even though a new album (SK3 – The Space Musical) were in production and planned for a 2008 release.
While never formally breaking up, after Goodbye, Spaceblade (Re-recorded), Woxlin decided to concentrate on his solo project. As time went by Woxlin increasingly dismissed the possibility of reforming the band.

It was also praised for its dark and brutal comedy and inconvenience.
The themes was also described as despairing, nightmarish, dystopian, satirical and anguished. Also, some reviewers started to doubt that the impending doom was real or just a construct of the mind by the characters.

In an interview Woxlin commented that: "When you make jokes about these themes you can not be indelicate and you should have a purpose with it: why do we make jokes about this?
