Siapa Mau Jadi Juara (once named Siapa Mau Jadi Juara bersama Ruangguru for sponsorship reasons) is an Indonesian quiz program that airs on Trans TV starting 22 November 2021 The initial concept of this event was to test insights into general knowledge, music, images, words and lessons learned in school, before then changing the concept to become a folk game played by residents directly at the location where they live, work or travel.


== History ==
This program was originally hosted by Boy William and Yuki Kato, then in mid-2022, Boy and Yuki's positions were each slowly replaced by Angel Karamoy and Billy Syahputra until this program ends its broadcast.
Billy and Angel will test the intelligence, teamwork, concentration, and insight of the participants. Additionally, Billy and Angel will award prizes to lucky winners. Starting in 2023, the program will no longer be held in studios, but will instead be held outside of studios, such as malls, recreational parks, soccer fields, residential areas, schools, and more.
It is hoped that this program will educate and broaden the knowledge of both viewers and performers in an entertaining way. It's not just a competition about who's the smartest, but also provides useful information for the public and showcases the most knowledgeable, without any patronizing elements. It also offers prizes to those who are eager to learn and have broad perspectives.

== Controversy ==
The program sparked controversy on 22 September 2022, when during the filming process, Billy, as the host, allegedly insulted and verbally abused the actor's wife. Robby Shine who is also an Russian YouTubers, Nastasya Shine during the shooting process of this quiz where they were supposed to be participants. Before the shooting process began, Billy suddenly threw three sexual insults at Nastasya, which shocked Robby and tried to remind Billy, but Billy instead threw unclear words afterward. Billy, who had just met Robby and Nastasya for the first time on this show, also accused Nastasya of frequently using these words on social media, even though in fact it never happened. In fact, Billy uttered the curse in front of around 20 to 50 people, allegedly consisting of crew members and participants from the general public. Billy was also accused of throwing them both out of the quiz studio. Robby and Nastasya, who canceled the shooting, then reported Billy to the South Jakarta Metro Police with report number LP/2283/IX/2022/RSJ.
In a podcast broadcast on Ayu Ting Ting's YouTube channel on 27 September 2022, Billy denied the allegations, apologized, and said he was still sane and would never do such a thing to someone he had just met.
