Stage Entrance is an American variety and interview television show broadcast on the DuMont Television Network.


== Format ==
The host, Broadway columnist Earl Wilson, interviewed "established stars and young hopefuls" in addition to providing news about show business. On the quarter-hour episodes, Wilson typically had one famous guest and one newcomer. 
Artists who appeared on the program included Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, who received Downbeat Awards on the February 24, 1952, episode. Other guests included Jack Leonard, Barbara Nichols, Buddy Rich, and Mel Torme.

As with most DuMont series, no complete episodes are known to exist.  A short clip exists of an episode from February 24, 1952 featuring Leonard Feather presenting awards from Downbeat to Parker and Gillespie, and then a performance from Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Dick Hyman, Sandy Block, and Charlie Smith.
