== Reception ==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 24 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: "It might be fairly standard in terms of format, but Kubrick by Kubrick still offers the rare treat of hearing the famously taciturn filmmaker address his own work." 
Owen Gleiberman, writing for Variety, said, "Everything in a Kubrick movie is delivered to you; every aspect of it is visually, logically, spatially, metaphysically built. Yet in each case what that exquisite structure contains, in its very concreteness, is a mystery. Kubrick controlled every last dimension of his movies. Except what they meant". Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "As a look at Kubrick's methods, madness and burning intelligence, Kubrick by Kubrick is fluent and discerning". Eric Kohn of IndieWire said, "Kubrick by Kubrick lingers in the restless ingenuity at the heart of the filmmaker's work – a palpable desire to find new storytelling possibilities each time out".
The film won Best Arts Programming at the 49th International Emmy Awards in 2021.
