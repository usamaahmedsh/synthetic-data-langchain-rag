East End, West End is a 1958 British sitcom which was first broadcast in a single series of six episodes by ITV. It was produced by Associated-Rediffusion Television as vehicle for Sid James, who had made his name as the sidekick in Hancock's Half Hour. It was only with his starring roles in the Carry On films that he was able to move out of Hancock's shadow. James was poached from the BBC to make the show. A second series of thirteen episodes was announced but never produced. The scripts were written by Wolf Mankowitz, best known for his depiction of East End life in A Kid for Two Farthings.
