A Disney Halloween is a 90-minute Halloween-themed television special which originally aired as an exclusive on The Disney Channel on October 1, 1983.


== Summary ==
The special is hosted by an offscreen narrator (voiced by Hal Douglas) and the Magic Mirror (using re-edited vintage footage of the late Hans Conried) which incorporates segments from both "Disney's Halloween Treat" (1982) and "Disney's Greatest Villains" (1977) episodes featuring classic short cartoons and excerpts of various villains from Disney feature films. The opening and closing credits feature footage of the 1929 Silly Symphony short The Skeleton Dance, as did "Disney's Halloween Treat", but the coloring on the skeletons has been changed to green, orange, and dark green. The special was rebroadcast during October for the following years on The Disney Channel until the late 1990s.


=== Introduction ===
In later versions, Disney's then-chairman, Michael Eisner, introduces the special along with Mickey Mouse (Wayne Allwine) and Minnie Mouse (Russi Taylor) in their incarnation as costumed characters from the Disney theme parks.  Mickey tells Eisner that Goofy is on his way and "has been working on his costume for a month".  There is a knock on the door we see Goofy's "costume": Michael Eisner, overdubbed with Goofy's (Bill Farmer) voice.
This intro was also used to introduce The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad which resolves the confusion Michael Eisner posed when he refers to this special as "a Disney Halloween treat;" his referral was not meant to be a title for the program but rather a generic description for any Halloween program to follow.
