Hereward the Wake was a British television series, which was produced by the BBC in 1965, and was broadcast weekly on BBC1. It was based on the 1866 novel by Charles Kingsley. Alfred Lynch played the title role. Due to the BBC's policy of erasing video tape for reuse in the 1960s and 1970s, the entire series is lost; no episodes survive in the BBC archive.
