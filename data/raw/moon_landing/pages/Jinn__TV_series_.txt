== Critical reception ==
The show was panned by Middle East Eye as "badly scripted, poorly acted and sloppily directed", while Thrillist called it "generic," "unrealistic," and "confusing."
Jinn has an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, out of six reviews. Positive reviews praised its consistency, intrigue, and novelty factor. Negative reviews criticize the quality of its acting and script.
The series generated controversy for the scenes that feature “moral degradation”. These include two instances where Malhas's character kissed two different men in separate scenes. Another complaint involved the series's rough language. Jinn became controversial in Jordan, with some government agencies threatening censorship. It was reported that Jordan's top prosecutor asked the Ministry of Interior to stop the show's broadcast.
