Griffin Mission One (also referred to as Griffin-1) is a lunar lander mission developed by Astrobotic Technology as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The mission aims to deliver a suite of scientific, technological, and cultural payloads to the Moon's South Pole, specifically targeting the Nobile Crater region near Mons Mouton. Scheduled for launch no earlier than July 2026, Griffin-1 is a key component of NASA's Artemis program, supporting lunar science and exploration for future crewed missions.


== Overview ==
Griffin Mission One is designed to conduct experiments and technology demonstrations focused on lunar resource prospecting, volatile characterization, and surface operations in the rugged terrain of the lunar South Pole. The mission was originally planned to carry NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER), but following its cancellation in July 2024, the mission was reconfigured with alternative payloads while retaining its CLPS task order.
The mission will launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The Griffin lander, a medium-class lunar lander, is equipped with advanced autonomous navigation and hazard avoidance systems, enabling precise landings in challenging environments.


=== Payloads ===
Griffin-1 carries a diverse set of payload from NASA, ESA, and from other partners:

Astrolab FLIP Rover: A 500 kg rover capable of carrying 30 kg of additional payloads, a precursor to there FLEX rover.
Astrobotic CubeRover: A 2U-sized mobile rover designed for mobility demonstrations, capable of traversing several kilometers and recharging via solar panels.
Nanofiche GLPH (Galactic Library Preserve Humanity): A durable nanoscale archive etched on nickel, containing cultural and intellectual artifacts, including literature, art, historical documents (e.g., Apollo Guidance Computer archives, Miracle on 34th Street: The Musical), the reimagined Library of Alexandria, and Lunar Codex archives. It is designed to endure lunar conditions for millions of years.
