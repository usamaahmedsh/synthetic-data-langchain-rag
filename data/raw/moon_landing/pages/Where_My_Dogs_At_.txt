The series premiered as part of its Sic'emation lineup on June 10, 2006, and ended its run on July 29, 2006. It centers around a pair of unlikely, different dogs: a young beagle and a lazy bulldog named Buddy and Woof.

== Plot ==
The show lampoons celebrity stardom in various ways;  for example, many of the characters based on real celebrities have other voice actors impersonating their voices (such as Steve-O from Jackass and Wildboyz, who appeared in the third episode).
Set in the streets of Hollywood, the series features the main adventures of a rare but smart, brown and white beagle named Buddy who separated from his 10-year-old owner Jeffy in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and his lovable best friend Woof, the lazy and tough bulldog (to whom Buddy refers as obsessed), as he runs away from his owner. The dogs are avoided by the Dog Catcher.
