== Controversies ==


=== Delhi gang-rape case ===

Bhartiya Stree Shakti (Nagpur Wing), a non-governmental organisation, Information and Broadcasting Ministry of India intervened and asked Sony Entertainment Television not to telecast a program about the Delhi gang-rape case. On 10 September 2013, the show was given permission to present the 2012 Delhi gang rape case on their show, and the promos of the episode were aired. The episode was aired in a two-episode part on September 21, 2013, and September 22, 2013. In this episode the head police inspector's role was played by Sanjeev Tyagi.


=== Om Prakash Chautala teacher recruitment scam ===
Sony TV was to air episodes based on the Om Prakash Chautala teacher recruitment scam in the show. On 22 February 2013 Delhi High Court restrained Sony TV from telecasting the related episodes until 4 April 2013, upon the appeal by Chautala and others as the case was still in court and there was a possibility of bias of the show on the case. On 2 March 2013, show was given clearance by High Court. Clearance was challenged in Supreme Court and on 6 March 2013, the episodes of this case were again put on hold. On 3 May 2013, the Supreme Court allowed Sony TV to telecast episodes as the trial was complete and the judgment of conviction and sentence were in the public domain. 
Later, there were episodes of Crime Patrol that dealt with teacher recruitment scams, they did not specifically mention the Om Prakash Chautala scam. Episodes 252 and 253, which aired on May 31, 2013, and June 21, 2013, respectively, focused on Teacher Recruitment Scam.


=== Murder of Shraddha Walkar ===
A December 2022 episode about a murder involving an interfaith relationship, which bore similarities with the murder of Shraddha Walkar the same year, faced online backlash with calls for a boycott of the broadcaster Sony TV, for allegedly changing the religion of the murder-accused to Hindu and the victim to Christian. Though Sony later clarified that the episode was not based on the recent incident but on a similar case from 2011, it nonetheless removed the episode from access due to the controversy.
