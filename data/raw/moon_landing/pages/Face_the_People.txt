All episodes of "Face the People" are censored, regardless of time.
Initially, mainly profanity was bleeped and pixelated, but later episodes were bleeped for explicit language, sometimes to such an exit. The audience is not allowed to shout anything that encourages or sustains violence among the guests.
Furniture may be pushed aside, but the chairs are purposely large to preclude their use as a weapon.
