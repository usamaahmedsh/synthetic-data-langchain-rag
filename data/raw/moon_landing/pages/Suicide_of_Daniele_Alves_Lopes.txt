Daniele Alves Lopes was a 16-year-old Brazilian who jumped to her death from the Centro Comercial Presidente building in São Paulo's central business district. The suicide was filmed by a Brazilian news show, Aqui Agora, and shown on SBT. This broadcast led to a surge in ratings and a national conversation about the sensationalized, violent, and amoral nature of the show.


== Death ==
On July 5, 1993, Daniele Lopes, despondent from a recent romantic break-up, climbed out on a seventh-story parapet of an office building where she worked as a receptionist. While she was contemplating her fate, police and a news crew arrived and started filming. The events were filmed until after the girl jumped, but the scene was cut before she reached the ground.
When the unedited footage was shown on Brazilian national television, it caused a spike in ratings. Lopes's youth and broken heart may have romanticized and contributed to the interest in the incident.


== Aftermath ==
The Brazilian psychiatrist Jacob Pinheiro Goldberg was a prominent critical voice of the broadcast, stating it may cause a societal desensitization effect, and psychoanalyst Jurandir Freire Costa referred to the media as vultures. Other communication experts were also critical.
In 1994, the Alves Lopes family reached a R$ 1.05 million settlement with SBT for moral damage.
