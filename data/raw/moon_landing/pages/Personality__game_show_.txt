Personality is an American game show produced by Bob Stewart and hosted by Larry Blyden which ran on NBC from July 3, 1967, to September 26, 1969, at 11:00 AM, EST. The series was produced by Filmways. Bill Wendell, then on the NBC staff, announced the show.


== Game play ==
A panel of three celebrities, each playing for a member of the studio audience or home viewer, tried to predict how other celebrities answered a series of questions asked in pre-recorded interviews.


=== Round 1 ===
In the first round, two of the panelists were given three possible responses for each question asked to the third and after they chose, the correct answer was shown.


=== Round 2 ===
In the second round, each celebrity panelist had to guess how a series of people responded to questions related to the celebrity.


=== Round 3 ===
In the final round, each celebrity panelist had to guess how a different celebrity answered questions.
Each correct answer was worth $25 for the person they were playing for. The panelist with the most money at the end of the game won a vacation for his/her audience/home viewer partner.


== Music ==
The show's original theme was "Struttin' with Maria" by Herb Alpert, while the second was composed by Bob Cobert. The second theme was later used for Stewart's Three on a Match.


== Episode status ==
The series is believed to be wiped, as per network practices of the era, with only three episodes known to exist – #437 (March 4, 1969) and #542 (July 29, 1969). GSN has aired the latter several times, although it also circulates among private collectors as a studio master with production slate. Another episode from the same week as #542 has recently been discovered and uploaded to YouTube.
