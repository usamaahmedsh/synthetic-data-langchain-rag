D-TV is a music video television series produced by Charles Braverman and edited by Ted Herrmann. Premiering on May 5, 1984, on the Disney Channel, the series combined both classic and contemporary popular music with various footage of vintage animated shorts and feature films from The Walt Disney Company, created out of the trend of music videos on cable channel MTV, which inspired the name of this series.


== Content ==
Most songs used in the series were contemporary hits (e.g., "Kiss on My List" and "Private Eyes" by Hall & Oates), though older songs like Sheb Wooley's "The Purple People Eater" were also featured. These music videos were shown as filler material on the Disney Channel (which refrained from airing commercials at the time), as well as being the focus of several television specials. Home video collections were also released on VHS, Beta, CED Videodisc, and Laserdisc formats. After the first run of D-TV, in 1989, a second series was produced known as DTV².


== Theme music ==
The main title music, known as "RPM", was created in 1981 by a recording company called Network Music. When the segments were shown individually on television, the title music used was from "Sunset Boulevard", also by Network Music. In the show's opening, a cheese-like Moon zooms out to reveal a black background with blue musical notes. A silhouette of Mickey Mouse's head rises from the Moon, and it exits below the screen. The letter D (in the corporate Disney font) and the letters TV appear and zoom out to attach to the head. Finally, after a few seconds, the screen zooms into the silhouette of the head, which reveals several vintage Disney cartoon clips.
