== Controversy ==
In September 2017, parents spotted a drawing of a penis in the series' 35th episode. After the clip went viral on Facebook, Netflix temporarily removed the episode from the website. The episode subsequently returned with the offensive drawing edited out. The production company apologized to many fans and stated it was "a very bad joke from one of the 150 artists working on the production".
