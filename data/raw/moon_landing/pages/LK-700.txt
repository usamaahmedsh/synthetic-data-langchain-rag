LK-700 was a Soviet direct ascent lunar lander program proposed in 1964. It was developed by Vladimir Chelomey as an alternative to the N1-L3 program. It was also a further development of the LK-1 lunar flyby spacecraft.
It would have been launched using the proposed UR-700 rocket (related to the Proton rocket) with a crew of three cosmonauts on a direct flight to the lunar surface and back.
The direct landing approach would allow the Soviets to land anywhere on the moon's nearside. The program was canceled in 1974.


== Mission profile ==
Uncrewed flights would be followed by  crewed flights. The proposed schedule was:

May 1972: First UR-700/LK-700 uncrewed launch. Subsequent launches in November 1972 and April 1973.
April 1973: First crewed UR-700/LK-700 launch. Subsequent flights in August and October 1973.
Following initial LK-700 landings, the more ambitious Lunar Expeditionary Complex (LKE) would be delivered to the surface in three UR-700 launches:

Launch 1: lunar station to enable a six-month stay
Launch 2: LK-700 with crew
Launch 3: large rover
