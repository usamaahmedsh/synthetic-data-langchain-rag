Digital component video is defined by the ITU-R BT.601 (formerly CCIR 601) standard and uses the Y'CbCr colorspace. The specific encoding of ITU-R BT.656 was used to transmit uncompressed analog standard-definition television component signals in a multiplexed digital format.
Like analog component video, it gets its name from the fact that the video signal has been split into two or more components, that are then carried on multiple conductors between devices.
Digital component video is used in both computer and home-theatre applications. It was the internal signalling (as opposed to, e.g. RGB) in MiniDV, DV, and Digital Betacam.
Component video can carry signals such as 480i, 480p, 576i, 576p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p, although many TVs do not support 1080p through component video.
