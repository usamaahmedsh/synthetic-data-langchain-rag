Kent Ninomiya is the first male Asian American broadcast journalist to be a primary news anchor of a television station in the United States.  The Asian American Journalist Association, often referred to as the AAJA, notes that there are numerous Asian American women on the air at American television news stations but very few Asian American men.  This disparity is even more pronounced with television news anchors.  Kent Ninomiya was the first Asian American man to be a main anchor.

Kent Ninomiya became the primary news anchor for KSTP-TV in Minneapolis-St Paul in 2003.  His co-anchor, Harris Faulkner, is an African American female.  The all minority main anchor team working in a television market with very few minority viewers was heralded as a bold step forward by journalism organizations across the country.  Ninomiya was also primary news anchor and managing editor at WICD in Champaign in 2006 and 2007.
