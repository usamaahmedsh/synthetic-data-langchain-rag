== Reception ==


=== Season 1 ===
Undekhi received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences. Rajkumar Rao appreciated the show on twitter on the date of the release on his twitter page. Pramit Chatterjee of Mashable said it an Impressive show quoting "Undekhi is made of stories and people that we’ve met whose actions make them live in our minds rent-free. It’s what builds the sentiment that we as a nation are truly not free. Yes, the British have left us. But what about our privilege, classism, racism, communal divisions, power dynamics, corruption, etc? Did they take it with them? No. It still exists." Ronak Kotecha of The Times of India said it "An Engrossing and Gritty Crime Drama" giving it 3.5 stars out of 5. Avinash Ramachandran of Indian Express praised the performances of the actors saying "Competent performances power this thriller".
