Galaxy (referred to by some TV-focused websites as The Galaxy Channel) was a short-lived British satellite television channel, owned and operated by British Satellite Broadcasting.
The station, focused on general entertainment and children's programming, was one of the five BSB channels, based at the network's headquarters at Marco Polo House in Battersea.
Galaxy broadcast a mix of original programming, American imports and archive repeats from the BBC library. Its most infamous production was Heil Honey I'm Home, a sitcom about Adolf Hitler, and Eva Braun living as a couple in America with their Jewish neighbors, which aired only its pilot episode.

The station also broadcast children's programmes under the 'Galaxy Club' strand, which featured original programming, mixed with imported cartoons and series.


=== Logo ===
The Galaxy logo, along with all the BSB logos, has been critically acclaimed. On the TV Ark website, an archive of British television presentation history, Hayden Walker writes: There is no doubt the BSB identity was a serious coherent design. The project of work stretched back over a year and included product designers, model makers, composers and other specialists. The BSB identities emerged with startling clarity, with an upmarket pitch. Stylish and distinctive both on screen and in print, Lambie-Nairn designed identities which told stories. And of the Galaxy logo in particular: The ident had a lovely warmth to it, with animated swirls of colours and stars.  


=== Galaxy archives ===
Apart from Jupiter Moon and many of Galaxy's imported programming, the vast majority of the original programming made for broadcast by Galaxy, such as Up Yer News and The Happening, is now missing. Most was made by various independent production companies, including Noel Gay Television, with both the broadcaster and production company deleting their master copies – each thinking the other will have kept theirs.


=== Closure ===
Following the merger of BSB and Sky, the decision was taken to hand over Galaxy's transponder to Sky One, who took only a few programmes from Galaxy and incorporated them into its channels line up. Galaxy closed down for the last time before 4.00am on 2 December 1990 after an airing of an episode of the Donald Pleasence House of Horror, ending with a clean playout of the main ident, which quickly zoomed out of vision, showing a black screen for a moment before fading to the station's test card.
