== Kobe Byrant helicopter crash ==
The series gained mainstream attention in early 2020 due to the episode “End of Days" which included a scene that depicted NBA star Kobe Bryant crawling out of a crashed helicopter before it explodes. After the real Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash in January 2020, the episode was removed from the Comedy Central website, and the creators of the show asked people to refrain from sharing the clip on social media out of respect for Bryant.
