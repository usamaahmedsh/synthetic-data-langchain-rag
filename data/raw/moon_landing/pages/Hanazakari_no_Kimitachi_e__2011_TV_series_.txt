== Atomic bomb t-shirt controversy ==
A controversy arose following Episode 5's airing after Atsuko Maeda's character was seen wearing a t-shirt with the words "LITTLE BOY" printed on the back and "FOOL ON THE HILL FRIENDS" printed on the front. As the episode aired the day after the anniversary of the Atomic bombing of Hiroshima, of which the bomb used was named "Little Boy", the show was criticized by viewers for its insensitivity.
Following this incident, the Hiroshima Prefectural Government received 130 complaints concerning this episode, and a public official called Fuji TV on the telephone to raise concerns about the t-shirt's insensitive nature. The City of Hiroshima also received 150 complaints via telephone and email by the 10th of August.
In an interview with J-Cast News, the manufacturer of the t-shirt explained that this was meant to be a reference to several songs by The Beatles, namely Little Child and This Boy, as well as The Fool on the Hill. While they did state that they had no intention to make the connection with the bomb, they also apologized for the incident.
