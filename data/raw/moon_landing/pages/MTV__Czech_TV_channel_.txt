MTV Czech Republic (Czech: MTV Česká republika) was a 24-hour music and entertainment television channel that served the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
The channel was launched on 29 November 2009 under a licensing agreement between MTV Networks Europe, a subsidiary of MTV Networks and CME, the owner of TV Nova. After being acquired by Viacom, MTV Czech was replaced by a regional version of MTV Europe serving the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania at the start of 2014.
