=== Television drama ===
A live-action television series was announced on August 1, 2023. The series starred Haruka Kinami as Kyōko Tanaka and Meru Nukumi as Akari, and was directed by Ryūichi Inomata and Akinori Itō, with scripts by Tomoko Aizawa. It aired on NTV from October 22 to December 24, 2023. The theme song "Dress Code" is produced by Imase and performed by Le Sserafim.
On January 26, 2024, Ashihara, the creator of the original manga, wrote on her blog stating that NTV did not uphold their condition of keeping the television drama adaptation faithful to the manga, citing several scenes that were cut and changes in characterization. While Ashihara was unable to speak with Aizawa and the directors personally, the first seven episodes followed the manga's plot while she wrote the scripts for the final two episodes after the proposed ending for the drama was changed. Ashihara later deleted the blog post. Following her death on January 29, NTV released a statement the same day saying that they followed protocol by consulting with her and that she approved the script. NTV later apologized and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the matter. The results of that investigation were released in June, concluding that due to miscommunication between Shogakukan and NTV, none of Ashihara's conditions for adaptation faithfulness and script rewrites were conveyed to the production staff at NTV. In July, NTV issued new guidelines for live-action productions, internal communications, and human resources to address the issues found during the investigation.
