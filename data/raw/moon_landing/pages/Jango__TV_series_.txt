== Reception ==
The Stage and Television Today criticised the show, writing, "The half-hour needs a dose of good comedy writing to make it work, because at present it is just feeble. A pity that delightful Moira Redmond cannot be featured in a programme of her own. She has an obvious feeling for a piquant comedy role, but cannot really make out with the present material."
