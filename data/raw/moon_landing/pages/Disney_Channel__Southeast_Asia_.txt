== History ==


=== Pre-launch ===
The Walt Disney Company opened an office in Hong Kong in December 1994 to manage its television interests in the Asia-Pacific region, with the aim of starting a television channel in Taiwan with a 20-hour schedule. The channel's distributor was Po-Hsin Entertainment, a company partly owned by the then-ruling Kuomintang and was frustrated during the legalization of cable television in Taiwan.
The company announced plans in January 1995 to launch a satellite television station in Singapore, with its Singaporean television subsidiary running the facility. The facility was "not designed for a Singapore Disney Channel", pursuing the goal of launching the network in Singapore in order to explore business opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. The license was awarded by the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore on 1 March 1995, the first to be used entirely for and by a single company.
The facilities were formally open on 26 March 1995, three days before the launch of the Taiwanese channel, with a speech by Minister of the Arts Brigadier-General George Yeo, who delivered a speech mainly centered on the American cultural industry and the contrasts between the wholesomeness of Mickey Mouse and the cynicism of Beavis and Butt-Head, and how the rest of the world felt unsure about American culture as a whole. About 150 people attended the ceremony. Yeo affirmed that the resurgence of interest in Disney and similar products reflected a "deeper renewal of human society" and that even in a conservative country like Singapore, a country still dominated by "old-fashioned" values, products and programs from Disney were seen as "very comfortable" with consumers. Moreover, Singapore was the world's largest consumer of Disney products per capita at the time. The satellite station alone cost S$14 million with the possibility of Singapore being the second country in Asia to receive Disney Channel, pending negotiations with Singapore Cable Vision, which was set to start its regular cable service in June. In addition, the facility was also used for dubbing content in other languages, as well as moving more of the facilities done in Hong Kong to the new ones in Singapore.
The Disney Channel began broadcasting in Taiwan on 29 March 1995 at 2:00 pm (Taipei), marking its first Disney Channel overseas, with Po-Hsin Entertainment as its distributor, available in both English and Mandarin. The ceremony took place at Grand Hyatt Taipei in Taiwan. The channel operated from Walt Disney Television's facilities in Loyang, Singapore using the Apstar-1 satellite; negotiations with Singapore Cable Vision to include the channel on its package were underway. On 1 October 1996, another feed was launched in Malaysia, where it was available exclusively on the satellite TV platform Astro broadcasting solely in English.
Between January and February 2000, Disney Television International Asia-Pacific launched Disney Channel in more countries and was made available for Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines; broadcasting with an English audio track with Mandarin subtitles.


=== Expansion ===
On 1 June 2002, the channel was launched in the South Korean market, with additional Korean subtitles under English language, in July 2002, Disney Channel expanded to Indonesia, which later aired programs in Indonesian.
In December 2002, Disney Channel Asia moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore, seven years after launching its satellite broadcasting center back in 1995. A Studio D block for Saturday mornings started on 5 July 2003. It featured premiere episodes of US originals and studio-based segments.
On 2 April 2004, Disney Channel along with Playhouse Disney launched in Hong Kong. The standalone Playhouse Disney channel launched in Indonesia as well.
Over the first six months of 2005, Disney Channel Asia, along with sister channel Playhouse Disney (later Disney Junior) were launched in Vietnam, at a time where the country's under-14 population stood at 24 million, Palau and Thailand. It also launched both channels in Cambodia, its 11th market on 20 June 2005, with Cambodia Entertainment Production Co. Ltd. as distributor. It later launched Playhouse Disney in some markets from 2004 in the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, and South Korea.
In December 2006, Disney Channel expanded to Papua New Guinea on the HiTron cable service.
On 1 July 2011, Disney Channel launched its Korean feed separating the pan-Asian feed, which was the first Disney channel to be broadcasting with Korean dubbing. Later on 11 July 2011, its sister channel Playhouse Disney relaunched as Disney Junior.
On 15 September 2012, Disney Channel's third sister channel Disney XD launched in Malaysia. It was later launched in Singapore on 16 March 2013, Indonesia and Thailand on 19 October 2013, and concluding in the Philippines on 31 May 2014.
After the ban of Disney Channel India and Disney XD India in Bangladesh as the networks were constantly broadcasting content in the Hindi language and its heavy localization back in 2013, Disney Channel Asia was made available on several digital cable platforms, such as Bengal Digital, in the country in approximately 2016. Due to the closure of the channel, India-based Disney International HD started broadcasting in Bangladesh as a replacement.
Most of its programming was available on DisneyLife when it was launched in the Philippines on 25 May 2018. It was later discontinued on 1 April 2020.
On 1 September 2020, Disney Channel in Indonesia was separated from the main feed, following of the launch of Disney+ Hotstar on 5 September 2020. It also has a live stream on the website, and airs some idents as well.


=== Closure ===
Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior closed in Singapore on 1 June 2020 after failing to renew their contracts, on both Singtel and StarHub. Its content was moved to and replaced with Disney+, since it was launched in the country on 23 February 2021.
On 1 January 2021, Disney Channel and Disney Junior closed in Malaysia on Astro due to its children's offerings being refurbished, and the preparation of the launch of Disney+ Hotstar in the country. It closed down while airing Bolt at midnight. Disney Channel's content was moved to the streaming service, since its launch on 1 June 2021. Also on 1 January 2021, due to the review of Disney's business in the region, (particularly Singapore), its sister channel Disney XD was closed in the said region.
After 21 years on the air, Disney Channel, including Disney Junior and most of its Fox channels officially closed in the rest of Asia; and Hong Kong on 1 October 2021. It closed at midnight (JKT/THAI), concluding with Star vs. the Forces of Evil on the pan-Asian feed and Bao on the Hong Kong feed.

== Presentation and logos ==
With the launch of the channel in 2000, Disney Channel Asia began to use the "Circles" presentation package, until the end of April 2003, when the US logo (and design package by CA Square) as the "Bounce" graphics, it became the channel's on-air presentation format, then later rebranded using the "Ribbon" graphics from 2007 until 2011. Two more redesigns were made in 2012, then on 1 August 2014, with the current wordmark logo.
Disney Channel Asia started using parts of the US "Social Media" rebrand from 1 December 2017 and rebranded fully on 1 January 2018 at 6 am. As of 2020, it has also used elements of the US "Item Age" graphics, while Hong Kong and Taiwan keep its old branding before the closure.


== Final feeds ==


=== Southeast Asia ===
The pan-Asian feed was available in Thailand, Fiji, Palau, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. This feed ceased airing movies and started sharing the same schedule with the Indonesian feed on 1 February 2021. This feed officially closed on 1 October 2021.


==== Singapore ====
The schedule was similar to the main feed, along with local advertisements. Some programming was replaced by sitcoms. This feed was closed on 1 June 2020, after failing to renew their contracts on both StarHub and Singtel; due to the launch of Disney+ on 23 February 2021.


==== Malaysia and Brunei ====
Same schedule as the Asia feed, with local advertisements; began early on 15 January 2000. It was available in four languages: English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil. This channel was only available on Astro in Malaysia and Kristal-Astro in Brunei.

Therefore, there was the only impact that The Walt Disney Company would be shutting down Disney XD in Southeast Asia on the same date and time by following the review of Disney's business in this region, just before Astro has already confirmed with this statement before Astro shutting down both Disney Channel and Disney Junior on the same date and time. However, The Walt Disney Company did not announce that Astro would be shutting down Disney Channel and Disney Junior on 1 January 2021 at midnight. This feed closed on that date, along with Disney Junior and Disney XD, on Astro due to their refreshed children's package and the launch of Disney+ Hotstar on 1 June 2021.
