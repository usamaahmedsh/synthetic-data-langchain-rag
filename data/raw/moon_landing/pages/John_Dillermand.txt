== Reception ==

John Dillermand was popular in Denmark upon release, with 250,000 children viewing the first episode in five days, and went viral. The series has found fans among Danish TV personalities and children; according to a DR executive, children were making snowmen, drawings, dolls and songs about John Dillermand. At the 2021 Fastelavn festivities, John Dillermand was a popular choice of costume.
Catherine Bennett of The Guardian praised the series as something that British leaders could learn from. But the series' unusual premise was also criticized as pandering to pedophiles, or as making light of the #MeToo movement against sexual violence against women. A gender studies professor of Roskilde University, Christian Groes, criticized the series for its portrayal of a penis having its own force of will. Groes argues that this perpetuates stereotypical male humour which assumes it's the penis' force of will which gets a man into trouble, not the man's force of will - "This has been used to excuse a lot of bad behaviour from men."
The DR executive said that the series was part of DR's ambition to make "children's content that dares to tackle embarrassing, difficult, quirky and funny topics", that it was about being true to oneself and one's flaws, and that it acknowledged children's curiosity about human bodies. He said that the series was "as desexualized as it can possibly get", and that it was developed together with a child psychologist and other professionals who reviewed the scripts to ensure that children would not misinterpret what they saw.
