The Afterlight is a 2021 British experimental supercut art film directed and assembled by Charlie Shackleton.


== Summary ==
The film, produced by Catherine Bray, Anthony Ing and Shackleton, and distributed by their studio Loop, consists of scenes of actors from old films who are no longer alive. The only copy of the Afterlight exists on a single 35mm film print, so that every time the film plays it will gradually erode until eventually it will diminish entirely and become a lost film. Featuring cinematography from Robbie Ryan and composed of films from the 1960s or before, the film is entirely in black and white.


== Films featured on The Afterlight ==
The Asphalt Jungle (1950)
In a Lonely Place (1950)
Late Spring (1949)


== Reception ==
Jonathan Romney, writing for the British Film Institute, gave a positive review of the Afterlight, stating that "placed together, the images evoke a post-death existence, perfect, poetic and yet irreducibly desolate," and favourably compared the film to the 2010 supercut art installation The Clock. Adrian Hui of the Michigan Daily gave a more mixed review, praising its concept and "seamless [editing] between shots from different films as if they were the same film and pieces of dialogue from different films," but stated that as an experimental film, the Afterlight was "not experimental enough," arguing that the film was "not quite bold enough in pushing the boundaries" of its source material.


== Release ==
The Afterlight had its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival on 15 October 2021. As of June 2024, the film has screened publicly 56 times according to its official website:

== Loss ==
