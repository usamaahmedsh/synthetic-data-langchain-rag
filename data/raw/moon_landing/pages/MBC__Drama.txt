The MBC+ Drama was a Saudi free-to-air television channel owned by MBC Group. It was a joint venture between OSN and MBC Group. It was a 24-hour Arabic channel that offers a range of Arabic series First on TV to OSN subscribers starting 1 February 2009.
MBC+ Drama claims to offer programs up to 3 months before any other channel. MBC+ Drama is the only channel among its sister channels at MBC Group that requires subscription.
On 1 January 2016, MBC + Drama HD stopped broadcasting and was replaced with an OSN Ya Hala! Cinema HD promo due to MBC focusing on an alternative free-to-air channel MBC Drama and paid on-demand service Shahid VIP.
As of October 2016, it has returned, but the logo has changed color from orange to purple and is now a pay-per-view channel with the same format as before.
