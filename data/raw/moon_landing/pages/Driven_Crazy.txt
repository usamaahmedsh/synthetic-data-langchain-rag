== Production ==
All thirteen episodes were based on short stories from Paul Jennings' books, including Undone! and Uncovered!, both of which were released after the first two series of Round The Twist, which were similarly based on Jennings' short stories. After writing the scripts for the first two seasons of Round The Twist, Jennings left, after which new writers took over. The debut broadcast of first and only season of Driven Crazy occurred just two years before that of the third season of Round The Twist (in which – along with the subsequent fourth series – Jennings had no input).
