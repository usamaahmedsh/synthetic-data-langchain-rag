Syfy was a Latin American channel dedicated to science fiction and fantasy programming, owned by NBCUniversal International Networks, a division of NBCUniversal. The local version of the channel, available both in Spanish- and Portuguese-language feeds (for Spanish-speaking countries and for Brazil, respectively), was launched in 2007.
Until October 10, 2010, Syfy was known as Sci Fi.
The Brazilian feed of the channel, as well as its sister network, Studio Universal, is operated since mid-July 2012 by the joint venture between Universal Networks International and Grupo Globo-owned Canais Globo which already operated the Brazilian version of Universal TV.
The channel closed on October 1, 2023 and was replaced by USA Network after 19 years of absence in Latin America.
