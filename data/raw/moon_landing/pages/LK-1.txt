LK-1 was a projected Soviet crewed lunar flyby spacecraft. It would be launched on a three-stage Proton launch vehicle. The project started in 1962 under the lead engineer Vladimir Chelomey, with the first flight planned for 1967.
The LK-1 had its origin in several early 1960s spacecraft projects under the generic names of kosmoplans and raketoplans.
In 1965 the project was cancelled in favour of the Soyuz 7K-L1 spacecraft.
Further developments came as the LK-700 direct-descent lunar lander program.
