W1WX is Boston's second former television station (the first being W1XAY). This station started up in April 1929, and was owned by Shortwave and Television Laboratory, Inc., (which was founded on December 5, 1928 by A.M. "Vic" Morgan, Hollis Baird, and Butler Perry).
The station started broadcasting on 2.12 MHz, alternating between 48 and 60 vertical lines and 15 frames per second. In 1930, it moved over to 2.1-2.2 MHz and broadcast at 48 lines only, still at 15 frames per second.
In 1934, the station switched back to 60 vertical lines only, running at 20 frames per second until it shut down.
