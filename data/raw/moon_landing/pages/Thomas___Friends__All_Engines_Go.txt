Thomas & Friends: All Engines Go is an animated comedy children's television series created by Britt Allcroft and developed by Rick Suvalle that originally aired on Cartoon Network's Cartoonito block in the United States from September 13, 2021, to November 27, 2023, and premiered on Treehouse in Canada on September 18, 2021. The series was later released on Netflix in the United States from March 7, 2024, to September 11, 2025. It was produced by Mattel Television and animated by Corus Entertainment's Nelvana.
The series is a reboot of the original Thomas & Friends series that ran from 1984 until 2021. It was originally believed to be a continuation of the original series (with the two seasons labeled as series 25 and 26), but Mattel Television later confirmed it to be a separate series. It introduces "an entirely new approach to Thomas & Friends content," with a new animation style and story structure.
In October 2022, the series was renewed for two more seasons of 26 episodes each. The final episodes were released on September 11, 2025.

== Production ==
In October 2020, Mattel Television formed a new co-production partnership with Corus Entertainment's Nelvana Limited and greenlit two new seasons for the Thomas & Friends series, consisting of 104 11-minute episodes and two hour-long specials. The new episodes were said to be produced using 2D animation and include more physical comedy and music than before.
The new series was officially announced on February 5, 2021. Executive producer Christopher Keenan said it was, "crafted to appeal to contemporary audiences' sensibilities while maintaining Thomas' core brand ethos".
On October 11, 2022, Mattel announced that the series was renewed for a third and fourth season, each consisting of 26 episodes and a special. On February 27, 2024, it was announced that Series 3 would debut on Netflix in the United States.
Unlike previous Thomas & Friends media, All Engines Go was produced in North America rather than the United Kingdom.

Joly Herman at Common Sense Media summed up her review of the series by saying, "as cute, fun, adventurous as this series might be to young viewers, it has lost some of the character that the original show enjoyed."
Britt Allcroft, who produced the first seven series of Thomas & Friends, expressed disdain with All Engines Go, stating the series lacked the "magic" of the original series.

The series won Best Preschool Series in the inaugural Collision Awards in 2024.
