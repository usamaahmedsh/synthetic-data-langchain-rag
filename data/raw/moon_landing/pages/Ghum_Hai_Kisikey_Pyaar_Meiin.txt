== Production ==


=== Controversy ===
In July 2022, a lawsuit against the series makers was filed at IBF by some viewers against the then-ongoing surrogacy track where viewers claimed that Pakhi was shown becoming a surrogate mother through an illegal procedure.


=== Casting ===
In May 2023, Aishwarya Sharma Bhatt, who portrayed one of the key characters Patralekha, quit the series "to explore new opportunities" after a period of 2.5 years.
In May 2023, it was confirmed that the show was taking a generation leap and thus all the cast would be making their exit from the show except Kishori Shahane, Bharati Patil and Shailesh Datar who would remain on the show in a lesser capacity. Their roles ended in the show in January 2024 due to the track revolving around Savi and Ishaan's wedding which resulted in their characters' deaths. Shakti Arora, Bhavika Sharma & Sumit Singh were finalised to play the lead roles as Ishaan, Savi & Reeva post leap. Sumit Singh's character was initially named Sharvari in pre-production phase, later it being transformed to Reeva.

Shakti Arora also revealed that he was approached initially to play the role of Virat Chavan which he declined due to budget issues. Arora on joining the show said, "I treat every show like it is my debut show; excitement and jitters go hand in hand with every new show I venture in." Bhavika Sharma, on the other hand, said, "I am very excited and grateful, but at the same time nervous because ‘Ghum Hain Kisikey Pyaar Meiin’ already holds a legacy with itself; The show has set a benchmark, and we really hope to reach that height. We have mixed emotions with a touch of nervousness and happiness." In June 2024, after another leap of 7 years, Hitesh Bharadwaj replaced Shakti Arora as the lead actor. In May 2025, Ajay Chaudhary joined the show as Shrichand Goyal.


=== Development ===
The filming of the series began in September 2020. Mainly filmed in Mumbai, some initial sequences of the series were shot at Nashik.
In March 2021, the filming was halted for a few days when Neil Bhatt and a crew member tested positive for COVID-19 virus, leading to a change in the track.
On 13 April 2021, Chief Minister of Maharashtra announced a curfew from 15 April. On 16 and 17 April, the team shifted filming to Goa for a few weeks until the government issued a confirmation to resume shooting in Mumbai.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Uddhav Thackeray announced that shooting of all shows must halt within all parts of urban and rural Maharashtra. Hence, Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin producers moved to Goa and were permitted by the government to only shoot indoors, inside their bio-bubble. Everything proceeded as planned, but in May 2021 the producers shot a scene at Goa Fort, violating the regulations.
In May 2024 it was rumoured that show would take a 10 year leap but then it was announced that it has been cancelled. In June 2024, it was confirmed that show was indeed taking a leap and that the entire Bhosale family would exit including leads Shakti Arora and Sumit Singh.
In January 2025, it was announced that the show will see a shift in the storyline. Bhavika Sharma, Hitesh Bharadwaj and other cast marked their exit due to the shift in the storyline.
Due to declining TRPs and the third season not being well received by the audience, the production team decided in April 2025 to revamp the storyline and replace the current female lead, Vaibhavi Hankare, with the former lead, Bhavika Sharma. Hankare's character was killed off in a high-octane dramatic track as part of the revamp.


=== Filming ===
A massive fire broke out on the sets of the show located in Goregaon Film City on 10 March 2023 around 4:30 pm. It was reported that nearly 2000 people were present when the accident took place.
