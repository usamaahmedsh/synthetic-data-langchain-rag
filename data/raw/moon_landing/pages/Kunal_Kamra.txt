== Career ==
He started performing as a stand-up comedian in 2013, with a show at the Canvas Laugh Club in Mumbai. A clip of one of his shows, uploaded on YouTube in 2017, led to him receiving death threats for his satirical take on Indian hyper-nationalism. He started his eponymous titled talk-show Shut Up Ya Kunal in July 2017 along with Ramit Verma. The episodes typically feature a conversation with one or more invited guests, interposed with clips of news segments or debates, edited for humour. His performances include jokes about cabbies, bachelor life and ridiculous TV advertisements.
On 1 March 2017, he released a comedy video titled "Patriotism and the Government" on YouTube mocking the Indian banknote demonetization, the government and the attitude of Indians towards the army. He received several death threats for uploading the video. In 2018, he shared that he was asked by his landlady to vacate the premise due to "political issues".

== Controversies ==


=== Incident on IndiGo flight ===
On 28 January 2020, Kamra, while travelling on an IndiGo flight, confronted the news presenter Arnab Goswami, inviting him to debate with him. Kamra had raised questions about Goswami's coverage of issues on national affairs and the suicide of Rohith Vemula. Kamra later released a 1.51-minute long video of the incident on Twitter, which showed a non-responsive Goswami while being questioned by him. The next day, Indigo banned Kamra from boarding its flights for a period of six months. The same day, government-owned airline Air India banned him indefinitely. India's aviation minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, tweeted that other airlines should follow suit and ban Kamra to ensure that an example was set. The next day, SpiceJet and GoAir also banned him indefinitely. The ban was criticized for being excessive and against the rules of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.
Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap refused to fly with IndiGo due to their decision to ban Kamra. Two IndiGo passengers also protested and displayed placards on a plane in support of Kamra.
Kamra issued a legal notice to IndiGo against the travel ban demanding a compensation of ₹25 lakh (US$30,000).
On 11 September 2022, after his comedy shows were cancelled in Gurgaon, Kamra wrote an open letter addressed to the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). He challenged VHP to condemn Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse.


=== Accusations of contempt of court ===
After Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on 11 November 2020, Kamra made a series of tweets critical of the Supreme Court. Eight people accused Kamra of contempt of court and sued him. The Attorney General K. K. Venugopal gave his mandatory approval to initiate contempt proceedings related to the tweets. Kamra said he continued to believe that "the silence of the Supreme Court of India on matters of other's personal liberty cannot go uncriticised." He does not intend to retract the tweets nor apologise for them. He asked that the time that may be allotted for hearing his contempt case should be spent on more important cases pending before the court.


=== Accusation of defamation ===
In a show recorded in January 2025 and made available on YouTube in March 2025, Kamra, without directly naming Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister, Eknath Shinde during his performance, made some remarks that were not well received by Shinde's supporters. This triggered a controversy hours after the video was posted on YouTube. Workers from the Shinde-led Sena vandalized the Habitat comedy club, where the show featuring the jibe at Shinde was filmed. Twelve of the vandals were eventually arrested and granted bail on the same day. A First information report (FIR) was also filed against Kamra by Shinde led Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel for making defamatory remarks about Eknath Shinde. Kamra faces charges under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including 353(1)(b), 353(2) (statements conducive to public mischief), and 356(2) (defamation). After filing the FIR Murji Patel also issued Kamra a two-day ultimatum demanding an apology. Failure to comply, Patel warned, would result in escalated action against the comedian. Kamra refused to apologize and was eventually summoned by Greater Mumbai Police for questioning.
On 28 March 2025, he was granted interim anticipatory bail by the Madras High Court.
On 29 March 2025 The Indian Express reported that 3 more FIRs have been lodged against Kamra.
