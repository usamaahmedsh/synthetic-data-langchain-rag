Kids Channel, previously known as Knowledge Channel (2007–2014), was a free-to-air cartoon television channel in Mauritius operated by the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), the national state broadcaster. Launched as the Knowledge Channel on 18 September 2007, it primarily broadcast cartoons, anime, teen sitcoms, game shows, and children's educational TV series in both English and French. On 15 September 2014, MBC renamed the channel to Kids Channel. At a certain time, the frequency went on live streaming of TV5Monde. The channel ceased operations on 31 January 2015 as part of MBC's broader programming review, which also affected the MBC News Channel. The channel was accessible via digital terrestrial television.

In December 2006, MBC announced its plan to introduce 12 new channels, with prominent mentions of Knowledge Channel, Sports 11, and Ciné 12. Although MBC initially targeted a launch date of 12 March 2007, to coincide with Mauritius' National Day, the launch was postponed. The Knowledge Channel officially began broadcasting on 18 September 2007. At peak viewing times, it aired children's programming, alongside recorded TV shows from TV5Monde and Voice of America.
The channel rebranded itself as the Kids Channel on 15 September 2014. During its tenure, the channel featured TV shows produced by the Mauritius College of the Air, now known as the Open University of Mauritius. Following its closure on 31 January 2015, MBC resumed broadcasting animated series and other children's shows on MBC 1 during morning and afternoon slots, similar to its schedule prior to September 2007.
On 3 April 2023, MBC rebranded its 17 channels as part of digital transformation, and MBC 5 is set as a children and documentary channel.
