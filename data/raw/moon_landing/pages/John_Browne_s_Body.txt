== Reception ==
In a negative review of the first episode, Angela Moreton of The Stage and Television Today wrote, "There were some nice touches, but regrettably this first instalment showed no signs of carrying all successfully before it. The comedy was too forced and the laughs did not flow naturally." The  Western Daily Press reviewer Jean Blackmore called actress Peggy Mount "very subdued" in the show, lamenting that the script failed to allow her to use her "celebrated sergeant major's voice". Blackmore concluded that the show "did not provide many opportunities for laughs either". The Runcorn Guardian television critic Tom Gregg thought the show's stars, Mount and Naunton Wayne, were "undoubted assets" though said he was skeptical that "even they can inject more than an occasional titter into this silly story of underworld fun".
