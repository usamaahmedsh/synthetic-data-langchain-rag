This program is the results of the talents of many creative people at the Walt Disney Studios.

== Trivia ==
The announcer during the pre-show for the broadcast referred to the special as both "A Spooky Halloween Treat" and "A Halloween Treat" but never by its title.
The VHS cut the original broadcast opening, from the pan/zoom into Sleeping Beauty's castle to the ghost playing the organ in the Haunted Mansion, which subsequently also cut out the pumpkin narrator's "And" before "Now it's time for Disney's Halloween Treat." This portion of the opening is retained in A Disney Halloween" (1983).
The pumpkin narrator is actually uncredited in the special and VHS.
