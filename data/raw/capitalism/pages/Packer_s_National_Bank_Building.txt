== About ==
Designed by Thomas Kimball in the Second Renaissance Revival Style, the Packer's National Bank Building was the home of Packer’s National Bank. The bank was originally established in 1891, and its growth was closely tied to the Omaha Stockyards. Many of the bank’s early officers were executives in Omaha's meat packing industry. The bank left the building in 1979 and, in 1984, the building was renovated for use as offices and apartments.
