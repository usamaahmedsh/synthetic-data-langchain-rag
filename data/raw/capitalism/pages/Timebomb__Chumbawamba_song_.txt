"Timebomb" is a single from Chumbawamba's album Anarchy. It reached #59 on UK Charts in 1993. The album version of "Timebomb" combined elements of both the main single version and the "Techno Timebomb" remix, which was included as a B-side on this single.
The chorus of the song is derived from Stephen Stills' Buffalo Springfield song "For What It's Worth" .
The single also includes a cover of Leon Rosselson's 1975 song "The World Turned Upside Down", which was originally made popular by fellow English singer/songwriter Billy Bragg. The song is about the 17th-century Digger movement's struggles against their landowners, and shares a lot of lyrical themes with the 1649 Gerrard Winstanley composition "Diggers' Song", which was also recorded by Chumbawamba on their English Rebel Songs 1381-1914 album, which also features another song called "The World Turned Upside Down".
