The Société des Dépôts et Comptes Courants (French pronunciation: [sɔsjete de depo e kɔ̃t kuʁɑ̃], SDCC) was a French bank, created in 1863 and liquidated in 1891. Its business was subsequently taken over by the recently restructured Comptoir d'Escompte de Paris.


== Overview ==
In 1862–1863, Armand Donon fostered the creation of the Société des Dépôts et Comptes Courants and became the new institution's chairman. The SDCC was formally established by executive order (French: décret) on 6 July 1863. The bank was initially established at 3, rue Ménars in Paris, then on the Place Vendôme, and eventually in 1896 in a new building at 2, place de l'Opéra, at the time one of the most prestigious addresses in Paris.
From the late 1870s, Donon engaged in increasingly reckless risk-taking at the SDCC and withheld the relevant information from the bank's board. The situation became untenable and developed into a bank run on 11 March 1891, which the Bank of France addressed by providing emergency liquidity and eventually winding up the bank on 7 April 1891. The SDCC was subsequently absorbed in 1892 by the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris.
