Enough Is Enough is an anti-fascist protest single from Chumbawamba and Credit to the Nation, on Chumbawamba's album Anarchy. It reached #56 on UK charts in 1993 and was supported by a music video.


== History ==
The b-side, "Hear No Bullshit (On Fire Mix)", is a remix of the Credit to the Nation single "Hear No Bullshit See No Bullshit Say No Bullshit" released the same year, and samples Chumbawamba's Song "Mouthful of Shit" from their album Anarchy.


== Commercial performance ==
The song gave Chumbawamba their first entry on the UK Singles Chart. It debuted on the chart dated 18 September 1993, at number 56; the following week, it fell to number 64. The song remained their highest-charting in the UK until "Tubthumping" peaked at number 2 on the chart four years later.


== "Enough is Enough (Kick it Over)" ==
In July 2000, the band recorded a version of the song featuring new topical lyrics, called 'Enough Is Enough (Kick It Over)', and gave away a one-track CD of it at their shows in Austria. This followed the formation of a coalition government including the FPÖ, a party led by Austrian politician and Nazi apologist Jörg Haider, who later that year stepped down from direct control of the party due to international pressure. This version of the song was also performed at the band's final gig and appears on the live DVD Going, Going – Live at Leeds City Varieties.
