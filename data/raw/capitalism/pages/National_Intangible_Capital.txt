Process capital: Operational functionality of the nation
Renewal capital: Capacity for knowledge creation, exploitation and innovation
Economic impacts of NIC in GDP formation as percentage (%) of GDP, i.e. how much of GDP is depending on and produced by utilizing NIC
Efficiency of NIC as output/input ratio, i.e. ratio of percentage impact in GDP per cost of input as percentage of GDP
In further sections national intangible capital NIC and the ELSS methodology is described in detail.
