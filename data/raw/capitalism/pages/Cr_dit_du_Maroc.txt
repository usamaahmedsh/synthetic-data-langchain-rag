Crédit du Maroc (CDM, Arabic: مصرف المغرب) is a Moroccan bank, established in 1929 as the Moroccan subsidiary of Paris-based Crédit Lyonnais and known under its current name since 1966.


== Overview ==
Crédit Lyonnais established its subsidiary in Casablanca in 1929. In 1950, it relocated to a new head office building designed by architect Edmond Brion on the prestigious boulevard Mohammed V.
In 1966, in response to the newly independent Moroccan government's push for marocanisation or shedding the colonial legacies in its banking sector, the operation was renamed Crédit du Maroc. Crédit Agricole became CDM's owner following its purchase of Crédit Lyonnais in 2003. 
In February 2021, Crédit du Maroc signed a partnership with the National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills (Anapec) to work on promoting entrepreneurship.
In late April 2022, Crédit Agricole announced the sale of its 78.7 percent stake in Crédit du Maroc to the Holmarcom Group. A new visual identity was adopted by Crédit du Maroc following that change of ownership. 
The International Bank of Tangier (BIT) and SIFIM are subsidiaries of the CDM Group.
