In the early 2000s, Ethiopia’s rural communities faced a stark reality: financial exclusion that left farmers and small businesses without the resources to thrive. Amid this challenge, a visionary named Haile Gebre Lube emerged, determined to transform lives and unlock the potential of Ethiopia’s underserved populations. Guided by the belief that “the best way to fight poverty is through cooperation,” Haile embarked on a mission to create a financial institution rooted in community and collaboration.
Haile Gebre Lube established a project office In  2002  with a bold ambition: to build a bank that prioritized access to capital for the most vulnerable. By March 2005, this vision became a reality as Coopbank  opened its doors, driven by a mission to empower individuals, foster partnerships, and enable sustainable growth.
Coopbank’s journey has been marked by groundbreaking achievements in financial inclusion. On top of the billions of ETB the bank financed to various economic sectors over the years, Coopbank has revolutionized access to credit in Ethiopia by lending several tens of billions to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) using its innovative uncollateralized digital lending platform Michu. This transformative effort has reached millions of individuals, the majority being youth and women, through innovative digital lending solutions that eliminate the need for collateral. These initiatives have reshaped Ethiopia’s banking landscape.
Moreover, the bank’s cutting-edge technologies, such as FarmPass, have revolutionized the agricultural sector. These innovations enable farmers to access markets, secure loans, and benefit from tailored agri-finance solutions, creating sustainable opportunities for growth.
