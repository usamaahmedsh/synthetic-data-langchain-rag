Shop Pay (formerly Shopify Pay) is a checkout and payment method developed by Shopify. The service allows users to securely store shipping and billing information in their Shop account, enabling one-click checkouts across online stores that offer Shop Pay.
Shop Pay relies on a payments processing service, such as Shopify Payments (the default option) or another payment provider, to process transactions. 
As of 2024, Shop Pay had over 150 million registered users worldwide.


== History ==
In April 2017, Shopify announced the checkout feature called Shopify Pay. Later that same year, the company announced a new package tracking app, Arrive, which tracked customer orders from brands on the platform and other online shopping sources.
Early in 2020, a rebranded Shop Pay button appeared on participating checkouts; later that spring, Arrive was rebranded as Shop.
In 2024, Shop Pay expanded to other commerce platforms and no longer required businesses to be on Shopify to use it.
In 2025, Shopify set foot on the ground in many countries across the European Union, showing their commitment to the region. The same year, Shop Pay was made available in 15 additional European countries.
