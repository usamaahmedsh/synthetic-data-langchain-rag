Trustco Bank Namibia Ltd., formerly the FIDES Bank Namibia, was a commercial bank in Namibia owned by Trustco Group Holdings. Its main commercial activity was to provide microfinancing services.


== History ==
The bank was built after a pilot project called Koshi Yomuti ELO. This project developed microfinance activities from 2002 to 2010, targeting specifically rural population seeking to develop income generation activities.
This project initially started in Ohangwena Region and moved to Ondangwa in 2005,  Oshakati in 2006 and Outapi in 2007.
Upon creation of the bank, then operating as FIDES Bank Namibia, the portfolio of loan was transferred to the new institution, which developed from then on an MSME portfolio as well.
The bank received its provisional banking license on 4 August 2009. and its permanent license on 1 February 2010.
Trustco Bank Namibia Limited was dissolved in 2024, after several regulatory and financial setbacks led parent company Trustco Group Holdings to exit its commercial banking investment in Namibia. The bank returned its banking license to the Bank of Namibia for immediate cancellation.

The institution had its headquarters located in Ongwediva in Oshana Region (North-Central part of Namibia). It was one of five commercial banks in 2009 licensed to operate in the country by the Bank of Namibia (the national banking regulator) and the first microfinance bank created in the country since independence.
Trustco Bank Namibia was active in two banking segments:

income generation activities financing (microfinance): this activity aimed at proposing savings and loans products to a clientele mainly located in rural areas of the country. The development of this activity was based on a group methodology and dealt with populations almost exclusively excluded from the formal Namibian banking system.
