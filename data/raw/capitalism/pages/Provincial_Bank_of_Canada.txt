The Provincial Bank of Canada (French: Banque provinciale du Canada) was a Canadian bank that existed from 1861 to 1979. The bank was founded in Montreal as the Banque Jacques-Cartier, and on 7 May 1900 changed its name to the Banque provinciale.

In 1970, the bank acquired the Banque populaire, which had been founded in 1848 as the Caisse d'économie de Notre-Dame de Québec. In 1977 it acquired the Unity Bank of Canada, a small Toronto bank founded in 1972.
It merged with the Banque Canadienne Nationale to form the National Bank of Canada in 1979.

A notable President of the Bank was Sir Hormidas Laporte, who previously served as Mayor of Montreal, and occupied the position from 1907 to 1934.
