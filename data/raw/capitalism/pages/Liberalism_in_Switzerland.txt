This article gives an overview of liberalism and the historical radicalism movement within liberalism in Switzerland. It is limited to liberal and radical parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.


== Introduction ==
In the nineteenth century the radicalism of Freisinn became the dominant political force in Switzerland, which remained for a long time in the twentieth century. Both the major Free Democratic Party of Switzerland (Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei der Schweiz/Parti Radical-Démocratique Suisse, member LI, ALDE Party) and the minor Liberal Party of Switzerland (Liberale Partei der Schweiz/Parti Libéral Suisse, member LI) were centre-right liberal parties that merged into FDP.The Liberals (FDP.Die Liberalen/PLR.Les Libéraux-Radicaux, observer LI, member ALDE) in 2009.
