Ralph Everard Gonsalves (born 8 August 1946) is a Vincentian politician who served as prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from 2001 to 2025, and as the leader of the Unity Labour Party (ULP) since 2001. He was the longest continuously serving prime minister since St. Vincent's independence in 1979, with almost 25 years in office. Gonsalves has been Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of North Central Windward since 1994.
He became deputy leader upon the formation of the ULP in 1994 and party leader in 1998. Gonsalves became prime minister after his party won a majority government in the 2001 general election. He was the first prime minister from the newly constructed ULP, following a merger of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Labour Party and the Movement for National Unity. 
With Gonsalves as leader, the ULP won a majority in the popular vote in every general election from 1998 through 2015, though it failed to secure the majority of parliamentary seats in the 1998 election. In 2020, the ULP won the election, but did not win the popular vote. On 7 November 2020, Gonsalves was sworn in for his fifth term as prime minister. In the 2025 general election, his party was defeated by Godwin Friday's New Democratic Party, with Gonsalves being the only member of the ULP to win re-election.
Gonsalves was the longest-serving democratically-elected state leader since Samoan PM Tuilaʻepa Saʻilele Malielegaoi was replaced in 2021, until his defeat in 2025.

He then enrolled at the University of the West Indies, where he completed a bachelor's degree in economics.

Gonsalves was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in London in 1981. He also attended Makerere University in Uganda according to his address at the United Nations during the Africa Day event on 25 May 2019.

In 1994, Gonsalves became the deputy leader of the Unity Labour Party. After the resignation of Vincent Beache, Gonsalves became leader of the party in 1998. He was appointed leader of the opposition from December 1999 to January 2001. 


== Prime Minister (2001–2025) ==
Gonsalves was appointed Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines after he led the Unity Labour Party to victory in the 2001 Vincentian general election. He led the party to victory in a record four subsequent elections: 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020.  Gonsalves and the ULP were defeated in a landslide the 2025 Vincentian general election by the New Democratic Party led by Godwin Friday. The ULP lost eight of its nine seats in the House of Assembly, with Gonsalves being the sole member of the party to retain his seat, North Central Windward. 


=== Domestic policy ===
In 2009 Gonsalves and the ULP led a referendum campaign in favour of constitutional reform that would have abolished the country's constitutional monarchy, replacing Elizabeth II with a non-executive president. The referendum was defeated, with 55.64% of voters rejecting the changes. Gonsalves has persisted in his calls for the establishment of a presidency, proposing another referendum in 2022 to replace the monarchy while also voicing support to rename places in the country named after colonial figures such as Victoria Park.
From 2001 to 2017, Gonsalves also served as Minister of Finance. He handed over the position to his son, Camillo Gonsalves in a 2017 cabinet reshuffle.
