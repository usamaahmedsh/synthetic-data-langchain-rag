The Canadian Bankers Association (CBA; French: Association des banquiers canadiens) is a trade association and lobby group representing Canadian banks. Its over 60 members include Canada's Big Five banks, smaller domestic banks, and Canadian subsidiaries of foreign banks.
Founded in Montreal in 1891, the CBA is one of Canada's oldest interest groups. The CBA is headquartered at Commerce Court West in Toronto's Financial District and maintains additional offices in Ottawa and Montreal.
