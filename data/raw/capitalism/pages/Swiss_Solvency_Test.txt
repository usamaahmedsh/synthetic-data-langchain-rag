The Swiss Solvency Test (SST) is a risk-based capital standard for insurance companies in Switzerland, in use since 2006. The SST was developed by the Swiss Federal Office of Private Insurance (FOPI) in cooperation with the Swiss insurance industry.
The SST measures risks using the following basic principles:

Financial instruments with market prices must be recognized on the balance sheet at market price
Capital requirements must be risk-based
The balance sheet must be assessed as a whole without any off-balance sheet positions
