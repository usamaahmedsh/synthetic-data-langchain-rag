Muri (無理) is a Japanese word meaning "unreasonableness; impossible; beyond one's power; too difficult; by force; perforce; forcibly; compulsorily; excessiveness; immoderation", and is a key concept in the Toyota Production System (TPS) as one of the three types of waste (muda, mura, muri).
A direct example of Muri is asking workers to stay focused for a period exceeding 8 hours a day or expecting a machine to produce more than it can in a given time.
