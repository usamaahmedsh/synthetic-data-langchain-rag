The Salviati family was an important Italian noble family in the Republic of Florence.


== History ==
Some sources trace the origins of the family to a Gottifredo who lived in Florence in the twelfth century. The first documented member of the family is Cambio di Salvi, who in 1335 was among both the gonfalonieri and the priori. In all, twenty members were gonfaloniere and sixty-two occupied the position of priore.
