== Activism and journalism ==

Smurthwaite is the vice-chair and media spokesperson for British NGO Abortion Rights UK, and a member of London Feminist Network and the National Secular Society. She is also on the board of the Edinburgh Fringe Society. She is also patron of Humanists UK, formerly known as the British Humanist Association.
In October 2009, Smurthwaite took a place on Trafalgar Square's fourth plinth as part of Antony Gormley's One & Other project, impersonating with permission the Irish pro-choice campaigner Goretti Horgan who was unable to attend. She used the platform to highlight the disparity between abortion access in England, Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland.
In July 2010, Smurthwaite protested at the lavish funeral of writer Sebastian Horsley with a sign reading "Where are the horse-drawn carriages for the VICTIMS of prostitution?", attracting both praise and criticism. Smurthwaite has spoken at numerous rallies including the Rally for Free Expression, the rally against Tory MP Nadine Dorries abstinence only sex education bill and the abortion rights rally in London following the death of Savita Halappanavar.
Smurthwaite performed at the five-year anniversary party for the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain, and has hosted and spoken at a number of conferences including Feminism in London in 2008, 2009 and 2010 and Intersect in Bristol in 2012. Recently she has given talks about sex and about the intersection between atheism and feminism for student groups and branches of Sceptics in the Pub. In June 2014 she was a guest speaker at the 50th anniversary of the Birmingham Humanists.
In 2014, Smurthwaite was interviewed by the No More Page 3 campaign describing herself as a "passionate atheist", and not prudish in any way. She went on to talk about her battle with anorexia in her teens, "a part of me, almost consciously, made that decision that said, "I don't want to look like an adult woman because of the way that adult women are treated, as sex objects, I'm just going to starve myself, and if I don't ever grow boobs then nobody will ever be able to treat me like that and if I just stay looking like a young girl, by being stick thin, I'll be protected from that.", and I remember thinking that very consciously... A few years later I was down to under seven stone, and I'm quite tall and I was very ill, I didn't have periods for about 18 months, yeah I was very, very sick."
On 2 February 2015, Smurthwaite's show Leftie Cock Womble at Goldsmiths College was cancelled. The college's Feminist Society, who co-organised the appearance, complained about her views on decriminalising prostitution. Ultimately, the show was pulled because of a lack of ticket sales.
Smurthwaite has written for The Guardian, Cosmopolitan, The Independent, Stylist , The Scotsman, The Huffington Post, New Internationalist, The F-Word, Liberal conspiracy , Progressive Women , Big Smoke and London Is Funny . She also has a regular column in the National Union of Teachers' official magazine, The Teacher , as well as making regular posts to her own blog, Cruella blog. Her writing for The Independent has included articles about her grassroots work teaching English to female asylum seekers with the group Women Asylum Seekers Together, supported by Women for Refugee Women.
