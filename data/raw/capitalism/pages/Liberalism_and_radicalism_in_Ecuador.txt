This article gives an overview of political liberalism and radicalism in Ecuador. It is limited to liberal and radical parties with substantial support, mainly proven by having had representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme.

== Introduction ==
Liberalism has been one of the dominant political forces in Ecuador since the late 19th century. The movement became divided and lost influence in the second half of the 20th century. The Alfarista Radical Front (Frente Radical Alfarista) and the Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Radical Ecuatoriana) are two small remnants of the traditional liberal current in the country.
