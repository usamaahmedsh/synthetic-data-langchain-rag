The Bankers (Ireland) Act 1845 (8 & 9 Vict. c. 37) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which regulated the issuing of banknotes and the repayment of sums towards the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland for public service. The Act was later amended by the Bankers (Northern Ireland) Act 1928. Declan Curry characterized the Act as introducing a "highly restrictive monetary regime in Britain and Ireland".
