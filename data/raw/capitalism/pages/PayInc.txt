PayInc (formerly BankservAfrica) is an automated clearing house located in Johannesburg, South Africa, serving both national and pan-African transactions. It annually processes a significant volume of transactions, encompassing various sectors such as banking, corporates, government, and retail. Its role as Africa's largest automated payments clearing house is primarily attributed to its substantial transaction volume.  


== History ==

The establishment of BankservAfrica originated from the need to unify shared services within the South African banking industry. Prior to its formation in 1972 as the Automated Clearing Bureau (Pty) Limited, various industry-owned companies operated independently in different payment channels. The transformation aimed to streamline operations, leading to the eventual rebranding as BankservAfrica in 2010. In August 2025, it rebranded to PayInc.
In 2025, the Competition Commission approved a 50% acquisition of PayInc by the Reserve Bank of South Africa.
