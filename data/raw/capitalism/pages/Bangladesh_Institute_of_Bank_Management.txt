The Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM) is the national training, research, consultancy and education institute on banking and finance collectively owned by all banks that are in operation in the country.


== About BIBM ==
Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management was established in 1974 to train officials of banks and financial institutions of Bangladesh. Since then, BIBM has extended its scope to include providing Masters in Bank Management (MBM) and Evening MBM (EMBM) degrees, carrying out research in banking and finance, holding seminars and round table discussions, and aiding financial institutions in their recruitment. Even with these activities, which are somewhat complementary with one another, training still occupies the centre-stage of BIBM operation. But BIBM now imparts training to only mid-level and senior officials of banks and financial institutions and generally in areas where all its members have common interest.
