The building of the museum was constructed in 1892 as the main post office.  In 1917 the building was sold to a local bank and in 1927 when the local bank was bought by İşbank, the building became the Istanbul branch office of İşbank. In 1950s when other branch offices in Istanbul were opened, the branch office was renamed Yeni Camii (“New Mosque”) referring to New Mosque which is to almost adjacent to the building. The branch office was in use till 2004. In 2005 İşbank decided to establish a museum. After renewal, the museum was opened to public on 14 October 2007.
