The Scarampi family is an old and prominent Ghibelline Italian noble family of Asti and its environs in north-west Italy.


== History ==
They were bankers of the Casane astigiane first in Genoa and then in France and in Belgium. In 1337 Antonio Scarampi, in exchange for 115,000 florins, became feudatory of Bubbio, Monastero Bormida, Roccaverano, Cortemilia, Perletto, Cairo, Altare and other places of the Langhe. Oddone, Giacomo and Giovannone, three of the five sons of Antonio, each originated their own lineages. Notably, the lineages that are still present nowadays are: Scarampi del Cairo, Scarampi di Villanova and Scarampi di Pruney.
