The Art of Shrinking Heads: The New Servitude of the Liberated in the Era of Total Capitalism (French: L'Art de réduire les têtes. Sur la nouvelle servitude de l'homme libéré à l'ère du capitalisme total) is a 2003 book by the French writer Dany-Robert Dufour. It is a critical examination of post-war liberalism, and what Dufour describes as a tendency in neoliberal capitalism of trying to create its own New Man. The book appeared in English translation by David Macey through Polity.
