Anarchapulco is an annual anarcho-capitalist and voluntaryist conference held in Acapulco, Mexico. It was founded by Canadian-Dominican activist and entrepreneur Jeff Berwick in 2015. The term is a portmanteau of anarchy and Acapulco.
The conference attracted increased attention and controversy after a member of the community, a fugitive from American drug charges, Shane Cress, using the pseudonym John Galton, was shot and killed at his home in Acapulco.
