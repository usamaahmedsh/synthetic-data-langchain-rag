== Opinions ==


=== Socialism ===
Ramonet says that it is a betrayal of socialism for some social democrat parties to have chosen the Third Way between socialism and capitalism.


==== Fidel Castro ====
In May 2004,  Ramonet supported Castro when Castro disputed the claim by Forbes that he was the seventh wealthiest head of state. In 2006, after Castro had retired from public life, Ramonet praised Castro's legacy in a series of articles in Foreign Policy. He said reforms under Castro "have proceeded from a popular movement in which the hopes of peasants, workers, and even professionals from the small urban bourgeoisie have converged". He was approved as Castro's only authorised biographer. In September 2006, Ramonet published Fidel Castro : Biografía a Dos Voces.


=== Against globalization and neoliberalism ===
Ramonet has called for autarky and for regulation, taxes and tariffs that reduce international trade.


== ATTAC ==
According to Ramonet, globalization and neoliberalism threaten the sovereignty of national states. In his December 1997 editorial "Disarming the Markets", Ramonet attributed the Asian economic crisis to globalization, and said that it threatened the identity of national states. To counter this, he called for an NGO to promote the Tobin tax on foreign exchange. He became a founder of Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens' Action (ATTAC).
