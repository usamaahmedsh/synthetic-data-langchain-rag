The Deputy Governor, Sarah Alade, announced that Iroche was selected to lead FinBank Nigeria replacing Okey Nwosu. Others replaced on the same day included the CEO of the Union Bank of Nigeria, Dr. Bath Ebong, who was replaced by Olufunke Iyabo Osibodu and Cecilia Ibru who was replaced by John Aboh at Oceanic Bank.
