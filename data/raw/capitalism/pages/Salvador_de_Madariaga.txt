Salvador de Madariaga y Rojo (23 July 1886 – 14 December 1978) was a Spanish "eminent liberal", diplomat, writer, historian and pacifist who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature and the Nobel Peace Prize and awarded the Charlemagne Prize in 1973.


== Early life ==
Salvador de Madariaga y Rojo was born on 23 July 1886 in A Coruña, Galicia, Kingdom of Spain. He graduated with a degree in engineering in Paris, France.


== Career ==
Madariaga returned to Spain and became an engineer for the Northern Spanish Railway Company. He then came into contact with Generación del 14 intellectuals.
In 1916, he abandoned that for work in London as a journalist for The Times newspaper. Meanwhile, he began publishing his first essays. In 1921, he became a press member of the Secretariat of the League of Nations and chief of the Disarmament Section in 1922. In 1928, he was appointed Professor of Spanish at Oxford University for three years during which he wrote a book on nation psychology, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Spaniards.
In 1931, the Second Spanish Republic appointed Madariaga as Spanish ambassador to the United States and a permanent delegate to the League of Nations; he kept the latter post for five years. Chairing the Council of the League of Nations in January 1932, he condemned Japan's aggression in Manchuria in such vehement terms that he was nicknamed "Don Quijote de la Manchuria". From 1932 to 1934, he served as ambassador to France. In 1933, he was elected to the National Congress and served as both Minister for Education and Minister for Justice.
In July 1936, as a classical liberal, he went into exile in England to escape the Spanish Civil War. There, he became a vocal opponent of and organised resistance to the Nationalists and to Francisco Franco's Spanish State.
In 1947, he was one of the principal authors of the Oxford Manifesto on liberalism. He participated in the Hague Congress in 1948 as president of the Cultural Commission and he was one of the co-founders in 1949 of the College of Europe.
In his writing career, he wrote books and essays about Don Quixote, Christopher Columbus, William Shakespeare's Hamlet, and the history of Latin America. He strongly supported a united and integrated Europe. He wrote in French, German, Spanish, Galician (his mother tongue) and English.
In 1973, he won the Charlemagne Prize for his contributions to the European idea and to European peace. In 1976, after Franco's death, Madariaga returned to Spain and became a member of the Spanish Royal Academy.


== Personal life and death ==

In 1912, Madariaga married Constance Archibald, a Scottish economic historian. The couple had two daughters: Nieves Mathews (1917–2003) and the professor and historian Isabel de Madariaga (1919–2014). Constance died in May 1970. In November 1970, he married Emilia Székely de Rauman, who had been his secretary since 1938 and would die in 1991 at 83.
Madariaga died at 92 on 16 December 1978, in Locarno, Switzerland.

Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Spain (1936)

== Legacy ==
The Madariaga European Foundation has been named after him and promotes his vision of a united Europe and a more peaceful world. The 1979–1980 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.
