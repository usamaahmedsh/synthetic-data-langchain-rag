== History ==
Jaap van Etten worked as a diplomatic attaché for the Dutch embassy before launching Datenna.
In 2020, Datenna research showed that the "Chinese government has a stake in 53% of Swiss companies acquired by Chinese firms since 2010." The Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) in the Swiss acquisitions "is either part of the Chinese government, or the Chinese government has a substantial stake in the acquiring company but not a controlling one."
Datenna received proof of concept funding (soft loan) from the Netherlands Enterprise Agency, part of the Dutch government, in 2017. In 2025, MI6 Alex Younger joined the company's advisory board.
