This article gives an overview of liberalism in North Macedonia. North Macedonia was not an independent country before 1991, so the parties from Serbia and Yugoslavia were active before that year. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary for parties to label themselves as a liberal party.


== History ==
In the years immediately following independence, liberalism became a major force but, since 2000, the major political grouping has split into the liberal democrats and mainline factions. Nowadays, the liberals are divided into the Liberal Democratic Party (Liberalna Demokraticka Partija, member LI), part of the left of center government coalition, and the Liberal Party of Macedonia (Liberalna Partija na Makedonija, member ELDR), part of the right of center opposition coalition.
