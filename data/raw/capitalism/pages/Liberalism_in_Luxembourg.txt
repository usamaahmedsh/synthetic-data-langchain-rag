This article gives an overview of liberalism in Luxembourg. While liberal thought has had a long history within Luxembourg, organized political liberalism has only been since 1904 when the Liberal League was formed. It wasn't until 1925 that a liberal party became relevant, and since then, a liberal party has been one of the three major political forces in the Grand-Duchy. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. Not all parties listed have the word "liberal" in their names.
