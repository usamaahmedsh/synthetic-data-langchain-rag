Memo-posting is a banking practice used in traditional batch processing systems where temporary credit or debit entries are made to an account before the final balance update occurs during end-of-day (EOD) processing. The temporary entry created during memo-posting is reversed once the actual transaction is posted during batch processing. Some modern banking systems implement real-time posting.
Examples:

When a customer receives a same-day electronic credit, the actual transaction will be processed during EOD batch posting. To provide immediate access to the funds, the bank creates a temporary memo credit that increases the available balance. Later, this entry will be removed as part of the EOD batch process.
While ATM withdrawals are officially recorded during EOD batch processing, the withdrawal amount is memo-posted immediately as a debit to prevent account overdrafts before final processing.
