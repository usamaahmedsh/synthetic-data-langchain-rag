In economics, capital services refer to a chain-type index of service flows derived from the stock of physical assets and software. These assets are coordination, equipment, software, structures, land, and inventories. Capital services are estimated as a capital-income weighted average of the growth rates of each asset. Capital services differ from capital stocks because short-lived assets such as equipment and software provide more services per unit of stock than long-lived assets such as land. Unlike capital goods, capital services are owned by the person or group of people providing them. 


== Role in productivity measurement ==
Capital services are widely used in growth accounting frameworks to measure the 
contribution of capital inputs to productivity. The OECD notes that capital services 
provide a more accurate measure of productive input than capital stock, because they 
reflect the flow of services generated by different types of assets rather than their 
replacement value. Short-lived assets such as machinery or software typically have 
higher service flows per unit of stock than long-lived assets such as structures and 
land.
