The base stock model is a statistical model in inventory theory. In this model inventory is refilled one unit at a time and demand is random. If there is only one replenishment, then the problem can be solved with the newsvendor model.


== Overview ==


=== Assumptions ===
Products can be analyzed individually
Demands occur one at a time (no batch orders)
Unfilled demand is back-ordered (no lost sales)
Replenishment lead times are fixed and known
Replenishments are ordered one at a time
Demand is modeled by a continuous probability distribution


=== Variables ===

  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
  
 = Replenishment lead time

  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 = Demand during replenishment lead time

  
    
      
        g
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(x)}
  
 = probability density function of demand during lead time

  
    
      
        G
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle G(x)}
  
 = cumulative distribution function of demand during lead time

  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  
 = mean demand during lead time

  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
  
 = cost to carry one unit of inventory for 1 year

  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  
 = cost to carry one unit of back-order for 1 year

  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  
 = reorder point

  
    
      
        S
        S
        =
        r
        −
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle SS=r-\theta }
  
, safety stock level

  
    
      
        S
        (
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S(r)}
  
 = fill rate

  
    
      
        B
        (
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle B(r)}
  
 = average number of outstanding back-orders

  
    
      
        I
        (
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle I(r)}
  
 = average on-hand inventory level


== Fill rate, back-order level and inventory level ==
In a base-stock system inventory position is given by on-hand inventory-backorders+orders and since inventory never goes negative, inventory position=r+1. Once an order is placed the base stock level is r+1 and if X≤r+1 there won't be a backorder. The probability that an order does not result in back-order is therefore:

  
    
      
        P
        (
        X
        ≤
        r
        +
        1
        )
        =
        G
        (
        r
        +
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(X\leq r+1)=G(r+1)}
  

Since this holds for all orders, the fill rate is:

  
    
      
        S
        (
        r
        )
        =
        G
        (
        r
        +
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S(r)=G(r+1)}
  

If demand is normally distributed 
  
    
      
        
          
            N
          
        
        (
        θ
        ,
        
        
          σ
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}(\theta ,\,\sigma ^{2})}
  
, the fill rate is given by:

  
    
      
        S
        (
        r
        )
        =
        ϕ
        
          (
          
            
              
                r
                +
                1
                −
                θ
              
              σ
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S(r)=\phi \left({\frac {r+1-\theta }{\sigma }}\right)}
  

Where 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        (
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi ()}
  
 is cumulative distribution function for the standard normal. At any point in time, there are orders placed that are equal to the demand X that has occurred, therefore on-hand inventory-backorders=inventory position-orders=r+1-X. In expectation this means:

  
    
      
        I
        (
        r
        )
        =
        r
        +
        1
        −
        θ
        +
        B
        (
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle I(r)=r+1-\theta +B(r)}
  

In general the number of outstanding orders is X=x and the number of back-orders is:

  
    
      
        B
        a
        c
        k
        o
        r
        d
        e
        r
        s
        =
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  0
                  ,
                
                
                  x
                  <
                  r
                  +
                  1
                
              
              
                
                  x
                  −
                  r
                  −
                  1
                  ,
                
                
                  x
                  ≥
                  r
                  +
                  1
                
              
            
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Backorders={\begin{cases}0,&x<r+1\\x-r-1,&x\geq r+1\end{cases}}}
  

The expected back order level is therefore given by:

  
    
      
        B
        (
        r
        )
        =
        
          ∫
          
            r
          
          
            +
            ∞
          
        
        
          (
          
            x
            −
            r
            −
            1
          
          )
        
        g
        (
        x
        )
        d
        x
        =
        
          ∫
          
            r
            +
            1
          
          
            +
            ∞
          
        
        
          (
          
            x
            −
            r
          
          )
        
        g
        (
        x
        )
        d
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle B(r)=\int _{r}^{+\infty }\left(x-r-1\right)g(x)dx=\int _{r+1}^{+\infty }\left(x-r\right)g(x)dx}
  

Again, if demand is normally distributed:

  
    
      
        B
        (
        r
        )
        =
        (
        θ
        −
        r
        )
        [
        1
        −
        ϕ
        (
        z
        )
        ]
        +
        σ
        ϕ
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle B(r)=(\theta -r)[1-\phi (z)]+\sigma \phi (z)}
  

Where 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  
 is the inverse distribution function of a standard normal distribution.


== Total cost function and optimal reorder point ==
The total cost is given by the sum of holdings costs and backorders costs:

  
    
      
        T
        C
        =
        h
        I
        (
        r
        )
        +
        b
        B
        (
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle TC=hI(r)+bB(r)}
  

It can be proven that:

Where r* is the optimal reorder point.

If demand is normal then r* can be obtained by:

  
    
      
        
          r
          
            ∗
          
        
        +
        1
        =
        θ
        +
        z
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle r^{*}+1=\theta +z\sigma }
