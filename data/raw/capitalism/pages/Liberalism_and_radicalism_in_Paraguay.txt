This article gives an overview of liberalism and radicalism in Paraguay. It is limited to liberal and radical parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn't necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.


== Introduction ==
Organized liberalism existed in Paraguay since 1870 and is still one of the dominant political forces, though it has not been in government for long time. The Authentic Radical Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Radical Auténtico, member LI) is a left of center liberal party.
