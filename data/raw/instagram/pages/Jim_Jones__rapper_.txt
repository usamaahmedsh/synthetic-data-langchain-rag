Joseph Guillermo Jones II (born July 15, 1976), better known by his stage name Jim Jones (or Jimmy Jones), is an American rapper and record executive. He was a member of the now-defunct hip-hop group the Diplomats (also known as Dipset), which he formed alongside fellow Harlem native Cam'ron in 1997.
Following the commercially successful release of the group's debut album Diplomatic Immunity (2003), Jones self-released his debut solo album, On My Way to Church (2004), to moderate success. His second and third albums, Harlem: Diary of a Summer (2005) and Hustler's P.O.M.E. (Product of My Environment) (2006), both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200. The former's release coincided with Jones landing an executive position in A&R for the independent label Entertainment One Music (known then as Koch Records), while the latter was preceded by the single "We Fly High" — which peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and led him to briefly sign with Columbia Records.
Jones' fourth album and only release by a major label, Pray IV Reign (2009), was met with continued success and spawned the single "Pop Champagne" (with Ron Browz featuring Juelz Santana), which peaked within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. His fifth album, Capo (2011), was led by the pop rap single, "Perfect Day" (featuring Chink Santana). After a hiatus, he self-released his sixth and seventh studio albums, Wasted Talent (2018) and El Capo (2019).
