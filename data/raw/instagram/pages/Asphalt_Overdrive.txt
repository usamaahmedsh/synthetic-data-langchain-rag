Asphalt Overdrive was a 2014 endless running racing video game published by Gameloft and developed by their Madrid studio. The eleventh major game of Asphalt series. After a showcase in June 2014 at the E3 event, it was released in September 24, 2014 for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, Windows 8.1. The game is officially retired and no longer supported.
Overdrive marks a departure from previous games in the series, as it is an on-rails endless platformer in the vein of Temple Run and Subway Surfers, and takes place in a 80s-style rendition of Southern California.


== Gameplay ==
As stated earlier, Asphalt Overdrive is presented as an endless runner, and does not offer a traditional racing mode. Like in previous games, cars accelerate automatically, but are limited to a fixed, endless path with three lanes. Performing stunts and ramming civilian vehicles builds up the nitrous meter, to which the player can use in evading police vehicles.


== Reception ==

The iOS version received "mixed" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
