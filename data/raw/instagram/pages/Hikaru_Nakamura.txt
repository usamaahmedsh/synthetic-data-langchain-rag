Christopher Hikaru Nakamura (Japanese: 中村光, born December 9, 1987) is an American chess grandmaster, streamer, YouTuber, five-time U.S. Chess Champion, and the 2022 World Fischer Random Chess Champion. A chess prodigy, he earned his grandmaster title at the age of 15, the youngest American at the time to do so. With a peak rating of 2816, Nakamura is tied as the tenth-highest-rated player in history.
Nakamura has represented the United States at seven Chess Olympiads (2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018), securing a team gold medal and two team bronze medals, and participated in three Candidates Tournaments, finishing second in the 2024 edition, fourth in the 2022 edition, and seventh in the 2016 edition. In May 2014, when FIDE began publishing official rapid and blitz chess ratings, Nakamura ranked No. 1 in the world on both lists; he has remained at or near the No. 1 rank in rapid and blitz ever since.
Since 2018, Nakamura has pursued a career as a content creator and subsequently signed with an esports organization TSM, later joining Misfits Gaming and then Team Falcons. Having popular channels on Twitch, Kick and YouTube, Nakamura is one of the most popular chess streamers in the world, and is widely credited with contributing to the growth in popularity of online chess.


== Early life ==
Nakamura was born in Hirakata, Osaka Prefecture, Japan, to an American mother, Carolyn Merrow Nakamura, a classically trained musician and former public school teacher, and a Japanese father, Shuichi Nakamura. Nakamura has an older brother, Asuka. When he was two years old, his family moved to the United States, and, a year later in 1990, his parents divorced. He was raised in White Plains, New York. He began playing chess at the age of seven and was coached by his Sri Lankan-born stepfather, FIDE Master and chess author Sunil Weeramantry. Weeramantry began coaching the Nakamura brothers after Asuka Nakamura won the National Kindergarten Championship in 1992, which led to his developing a relationship with their mother.


== Chess prodigy ==
At age 10, he became the youngest American to beat an International Master when he defeated Jay Bonin at the Marshall Chess Club. Also at age 10, Nakamura became the youngest player to achieve the title of chess master from the United States Chess Federation, breaking the record previously set by Vinay Bhat. (Nakamura's record stood until 2008 when Nicholas Nip achieved the master title at the age of 9 years and 11 months.) In 1999, Nakamura won the Laura Aspis Prize, given annually to the top USCF-rated player under age 13. In 2003, at age 15 years and 79 days, Nakamura solidified his reputation as a chess prodigy, becoming the youngest American to earn the grandmaster title at the time, breaking the record of Bobby Fischer by three months.


== Chess career ==
In April 2004, Nakamura finished in fourth place in the "B" group at the Corus tournament at Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands.
Nakamura qualified for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004, played in Tripoli, Libya, and reached the fourth round, defeating grandmasters Sergey Volkov, Aleksej Aleksandrov, and Alexander Lastin before falling to England's Michael Adams, who eventually finished in second place.
In June 2005, Nakamura was selected as the 19th Frank Samford Chess Fellow, receiving a grant of $32,000 to further his chess education and competition.
Nakamura won the 2005 U.S. Championship (held in November and December 2004), scoring an undefeated seven points out of nine rounds to tie grandmaster Alexander Stripunsky for first place. Nakamura defeated Stripunsky in the rapid playoff to claim the title and become the youngest U.S. champion since Bobby Fischer.
Following that victory, Nakamura played a challenge match dubbed the "Duelo de Jóvenes Prodigios" in Mexico against Russian grandmaster Sergey Karjakin and defeated his fellow prodigy by 4½–1½.
In November and December 2005, Nakamura competed in the 2005 FIDE World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, seeded 28th (of 128 players) but failed to advance beyond the first round. He lost each of his two games to Indian grandmaster Surya Ganguly.
In 2006, Nakamura was offered a full scholarship to the University of Texas at Dallas but instead attended Dickinson College, with a partial scholarship, in order to take a break from chess. Later in the year, he announced that he would leave college and resume playing chess. The same year, he helped the U.S. team win the bronze medal in the Chess Olympiad at Turin, Italy, playing on the third board behind Gata Kamsky and 2006 U.S. Champion Alexander Onischuk. In the same year, he won the 16th North American Open in Las Vegas.
In January 2007, Nakamura shared second place at the GibTelecom Masters in Gibraltar. He placed joint first in the tournament the following year, finishing with five straight wins to tie with Chinese GM Bu Xiangzhi, whom he then proceeded to beat in the rapidplay playoff.
In October 2007, Nakamura won the Magistral D'Escacs tournament in Barcelona and the Corsican circuit rapid chess tournament.
Nakamura won the 2008 Finet Chess960 Open in Mainz, Germany. In November 2008, he won the Cap d'Agde Rapid Tournament in Cap d'Agde, defeating Anatoly Karpov in the semifinals and Vassily Ivanchuk in the finals. In February 2009, he came joint third at the 7th Gibtelecom Masters in Gibraltar, again finishing strongly with 4½/5 to end the event on 7½/10.


=== 2009: Second U.S. Championship and other tournament successes ===
Nakamura won the 2009 U.S. Chess Championship (St Louis, Missouri, May 2009), scoring 7/9 to take clear first place.
In July 2009, Nakamura won the Donostia-San Sebastian Chess Festival, tying with former FIDE world champion Ruslan Ponomariov with 6½/9 before defeating Ponomariov in a blitz playoff to win the title over a field including former undisputed world champion Anatoly Karpov, former FIDE world champions Rustam Kasimdzhanov and Ponomariov, 2009 World Junior champion Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, and Peter Svidler among others.
In November 2009, Nakamura participated in the BNbank blitz tournament in Oslo, Norway. He reached the final by winning all 12 of his games. In the championship, he faced the world No. 2 and reigning World Blitz Champion Magnus Carlsen. Nakamura won the match 3–1, further cementing his reputation as one of the best blitz players in the world, despite having not been invited to the 2009 World Blitz championship.
Nakamura skipped the 2009 FIDE World Cup in favor of the London Chess Classic in December 2009. Although he drew with the black pieces against eventual winner Magnus Carlsen and with White against former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, Nakamura failed to win a game during the tournament and ended in seventh place.


=== 2010: Gold medalist and top-ten player ===
Nakamura began 2010 playing first board for the US at the World Team Championship held in Bursa, Turkey. His performance, including a win over world No. 6 Boris Gelfand on the black side of a King's Indian Defense, won him the gold medal for board one and led the U.S. to a silver medal finish behind Russia.
Nakamura participated in the Corus Chess Tournament 2010. He finished with a score of 7½/13, tying for fourth place with Viswanathan Anand.
In May, Nakamura participated in the 2010 U.S. Championship in Saint Louis, Missouri. Seeded first, he scored 5/7 points to qualify for the round-robin stage against the former champions Gata Kamsky, Alexander Onischuk, and Yuri Shulman. In the round-robin stage, he drew with Kamsky before losing to Shulman, with the white pieces in both games. The loss to Shulman eliminated him from the competition.
From November 5–14, Nakamura competed in the 2010 Mikhail Tal Memorial in Moscow; the field consisted of Levon Aronian, Vladimir Kramnik, Alexander Grischuk, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, Sergey Karjakin, Pavel Eljanov, Boris Gelfand, Alexei Shirov, and Wang Hao. The average Elo of the field was 2757, making it the third-strongest tournament in chess history at the time. Nakamura finished with +1, defeating Eljanov and drawing every other player to finish in a tie for fourth place. Nakamura's round two win over Eljanov placed him in the world top-ten in the live ratings for the first time in his career. Nakamura's performance at this tournament, his first involving an entirely super-elite field allowed him to "force (the chess elite) to respect him", according to noted Russian commentator grandmaster Sergey Shipov.
From November 16–18, Nakamura made his debut at the 2010 World Blitz Championship in Moscow. Despite losing four of his first five games to Magnus Carlsen, Vladimir Kramnik, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, and Sergey Karjakin, he recovered to score 5/7 in the second half of the day and finished with a score of 7½/14, 2½ points behind co-leaders Carlsen and Levon Aronian, whom he defeated in their individual games. On the second day, Nakamura avenged his earlier losses against both Carlsen and Kramnik and scored 8/14, for a total of 15½/28, three points behind Aronian and a point and a half behind Carlsen. Nakamura finished with 21½/38 for fifth place.
In December 2010, Nakamura finished fourth in the London Chess Classic, among a field including Anand, Carlsen, Kramnik, Michael Adams, Nigel Short, David Howell, and Luke McShane. Nakamura's performance ensured that he would officially join the world top ten in January 2011.


=== 2011: Tata Steel Group A victory ===
Nakamura began training with former world champion Garry Kasparov. The first of several training sessions were held in New York at the beginning of January, but the training ended in December 2011.
From January 14–30, Nakamura competed in the Tata Steel Tournament in Wijk aan Zee among a field of Magnus Carlsen, Viswanathan Anand, Levon Aronian, Vladimir Kramnik, Alexander Grischuk, Ruslan Ponomariov, Ian Nepomniachtchi, Wang Hao, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Alexei Shirov, Anish Giri, Jan Smeets, and Erwin L'Ami. The average rating of the field was 2740, making this thirteen-round event a category 20 tournament. After twelve rounds, Nakamura was in clear first place with 8½ points going into the final round, half a point ahead of Anand and a full point ahead of Carlsen and Aronian. In the final round, Nakamura drew against Wang with the black pieces in a King's Indian Defense. With the draw, Nakamura finished with 9/13 (+5), a tournament performance rating of 2879, and guaranteed at least a share of first place. With Anand's final round draw against Nepomniachtchi, Nakamura clinched sole possession of first place, making him the first American to win the Wijk aan Zee tournament since 1980. The win also guaranteed that Nakamura would join Carlsen (winner of the 2010 Pearl Spring chess tournament) as qualifiers for Grand Slam Masters Final 2011 in September 2011. Nakamura after the tournament stated that his goal was to reach a 2800 rating by the end of the year; the win raised his rating from 2751 to 2774 and from world No. 10 to world No. 7 on the unofficial live rating list.
Kasparov called Nakamura's victory the best by an American in more than 100 years:

In an e-mail, Kasparov said, "Fischer never won a tournament ahead of the world champion. He was second in Santa Monica", referring to the Second Piatigorsky Cup. "Of course, there were far fewer such events back then, and Fischer had several great tournament results like Stockholm 62", the interzonal qualifier for the world championship. "Reuben Fine only equaled Keres on points at AVRO in 38." Referring to the breakout performance of Frank J. Marshall, the United States Champion from 1909 to 1936, Mr. Kasparov continued, "Then you have Marshall at Cambridge Springs in 1904 ahead of Lasker, though Tarrasch wasn't there. So unless you include Capablanca as an American player, I think you can go back to Pillsbury at Hastings 1895 for an American tournament victory on par with Nakamura's.
Following his super tournament triumph, Nakamura was given the key to the city of Memphis, Tennessee on February 15, 2011. The victory also opened the door for Nakamura to receive invitations from other super grandmaster tournaments for the first time, and increased his world ranking to a career-high number eight. In May, he contested a six-game match in the United States against world No. 11 Ponomariov, where he lost the first game but rallied to win the match 3½–2½, raising his rating to 2777 and ranking to world No. 6 on the unofficial live rating list, both career-highs to that date. From June 11–21, he made his debut at the Bazna Kings Tournament in Romania in a field including Carlsen, world No. 5 Vassily Ivanchuk, world No. 6 Sergey Karjakin, world No. 13 Teimour Radjabov and Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu; the tournament was a Category XXI event with an average ELO of 2760, making it the third strongest tournament in history; Nakamura finished 4½/10; the tournament was won by Carlsen on tiebreak over Karjakin.
From July 21–31, Nakamura made his debut at Dortmund; the field consisted of Kramnik, Ponomariov, Lê Quang Liêm, Giri, and Georg Meier. Nakamura had a second consecutive disappointing performance, beginning at −3 before winning his last two games, including a last-round win over tournament winner Kramnik on the black side of the King's Indian Defense, to finish at 4½/10.
Nakamura competed in the Grand Slam Masters Final 2011 in September, after which he played in the Tal Memorial for the second consecutive year in a field comprising Carlsen, Anand, Aronian, Karjakin, Kramnik, Ivanchuk, Gelfand, Hao, and Nepomniachtchi. He finished the year by participating in the London Chess Classic for the third consecutive time.

After another lackluster performance in the European Club Championship in Eilat, Israel, Nakamura finished first in the "crown group" at the Univé tournament in Hoogeveen, the Netherlands. In December he tied for third with Mickey Adams in the London Chess Classic with a +3−1=4 score. Nakamura finished the year by winning three silver medals in the three chess events (rapid, blitz and blindfold) at the World Mind Games in Beijing.
After what was to him a disappointing tournament at the fifth edition of the King's Tournament in Medias (although Nakamura placed third of six among a cadre of top Grandmasters), Nakamura tweeted that he was focusing on the 2011 World Series of Poker, in which he played, although busted out on the second day. Kasparov, who had been training Nakamura at the time, publicly grumbled about his interest in poker.


=== 2013: Top FIDE blitz rating ===

Nakamura began 2013 with a 7/13 (+3−2=8) result at the Tata Steel tournament in Wijk aan Zee, finishing sixth.

He defeated Caruana in their individual encounter but lost to Gelfand. Overall, Nakamura finished sixth in the FIDE Grand Prix 2012–13 series. He then played first board for O.R. Padova in the European Club Championship in Rhodes, Greece and scored 4/6 (+2−0=4). He defeated current Russian champion Peter Svidler with the black pieces in an extremely sharp King's Indian Defense. At the World Team Chess Championship in Antalya, Turkey, Nakamura led the U.S. team to a fourth-place finish. His personal record of 4½/7 (+3−1=3) earned him an individual silver medal on board one.

In January, Nakamura won the Gibraltar Chess Masters tournament, scoring 8½/10 (+7−0=3). In February, Nakamura won the Zurich Chess Challenge after a playoff event to settle a tie. Nakamura had one of his best-ever months as a chess professional in February 2015, and as a result on the March FIDE classical list Nakamura moved to his then-career highest 2798 and No. 3 in the world. That April, Nakamura won his fourth U.S. Chess Championship with a score of 8/11. In the final stage of the 4-stage Grand Prix event, Nakamura finished equal first with Fabiano Caruana and Dmitry Jakovenko with 6½ out of 11 points at Khanty-Mansiysk, giving him an overall second place Grand Prix placement, which automatically qualified him for the Candidates tournament to determine the challenger for Magnus Carlsen in the next Chess World Championship.

In the Speed Chess Championship final, Nakamura defeated Vachier-Lagrave by a score of 18½ to 12½.

Nakamura continued to play the Champions Chess Tour with the Opera Euro Rapid tournament in February 2021. In the initial round-robin phase of the tournament, Nakamura compiled an up-and-down record. His final round-robin game against fellow American grandmaster Sam Shankland was pivotal. A win or draw in the game would have secured Nakamura's qualification to the tournament's knockout phase. He obtained a winning position against Shankland but failed to convert the advantage and eventually lost the game. This resulted in his exclusion from the knockout phase based on tiebreaks with Russian grandmaster Daniil Dubov.
In the Magnus Carlsen Invitational, the next tournament on the Champions Chess Tour, Nakamura scored +3−0=12 to place fourth in the preliminary stage and thus qualified for the knockout phase. He then lost his two-day quarterfinal match against Russian GM Ian Nepomniachtchi. He drew 2–2 with Nepomniachtchi on the first day but lost 2½–½ on the second day.
Nakamura scored +4−0=11 in the preliminary stage of the New In Chess Classic, the fifth event of the Champions Chess Tour, thus finishing second and qualifying for the tournament's knockout stage. After defeating Lê Quang Liêm and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively, he lost to Magnus Carlsen 3–1 in the first match of the final and drew the second match 2–2, thus losing the final and finishing in second place. Nakamura qualified for the knockouts of the other two events, FTX Crypto Cup and Chessable Masters, finishing in the overall fifth place in the Tour after showing the second strongest performance in the Tour Final.
In August 2021, Nakamura won the Saint Louis Rapid and Blitz competition without a single loss in his first over-the-board tournament since before the COVID-19 pandemic. He had three wins and six draws in the rapid portion, as well as six wins and twelve draws in the blitz portion.

On the 29th he played the first leg of the 2021 World Blitz Chess Championship, but had to forfeit the tournament due to testing positive for COVID-19.


=== 2022: FIDE Grand Prix, second Candidates, and World Fischer Random Championship ===
Nakamura was granted a wildcard entry to the FIDE Grand Prix 2022 in December 2021 by the FIDE President. In the first leg of the tournament held in Berlin in February 2022, he played in Pool A alongside Andrey Esipenko, Étienne Bacrot, and Alexander Grischuk, making it his first classical tournament in two years. Through five rounds, he held a 3½/5 (+2−0=3) lead in his group. Following a thriller against Esipenko in the sixth round, Nakamura held a draw with Black to win his group and advance to the semifinals to face Richárd Rapport. With White, he convincingly won a complicated rook-and-pawn endgame to take a 1–0 lead in the semifinals. He held a draw in the following game to advance to the finals against Levon Aronian. The classical portion was drawn, but he won in rapid 2–0 to win the first leg of the tournament.
On March 18, Nakamura won the 2022 edition of the Bullet Chess Championship hosted by chess.com, beating Andrew Tang in the final.
Entering the third and final leg of the FIDE Grand Prix 2022, Nakamura was ranked second in the Grand Prix standings with 13 points. He played in Pool A alongside Andrey Esipenko, Grigoriy Oparin, and Levon Aronian, who was ranked third in the standings entering the tournament with 10 points. On March 28, Nakamura defeated Esipenko to finish a 4/6 run in the round-robin stage, guaranteeing him at least second place and qualifying him for the Candidates Tournament 2022. On March 31, after a draw in the semi-finals against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, he secured first place in the Grand Prix standings, thus winning the Grand Prix 2022 series. He would eventually proceed to defeat Mamedyarov by drawing in classical and proceeding to rapid tiebreakers, where he won the tiebreakers in a 2–0 sweep. This briefly propelled Nakamura to the highest live rapid chess rating on April 1, surpassing Magnus Carlsen, though Carlsen regained his number one spot after Nakamura lost to Wesley So on tiebreakers in the finals of the third leg of the Grand Prix. From June 16 to July 4, Nakamura participated in the 2022 Candidates Tournament, finishing in fourth place with a score of 7½/14. Had Nakamura drawn or won against Ding Liren in the final round of the tournament, he would have finished second and faced Ian Nepomniachtchi to determine a new World Chess Champion following Carlsen's decision (which was affirmed following the candidates) not to defend his title.
On October 20, Hans Niemann filed a $100 million lawsuit against Nakamura and others (see Carlsen–Niemann controversy.) Later in October, Nakamura won the second World Fischer Random Chess Championship ahead of reigning World Fischer Random Champion Wesley So, World Classical Champion Magnus Carlsen, World Rapid Champion Nodirbek Abdusattorov, and 2021 World Chess Championship challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi, defeating the latter in the armageddon match. In December, Nakamura won his fifth straight Speed Chess Championship, defeating Magnus Carlsen 14½ vs. 13½ in the final.  On December 30, Nakamura finished as the runner-up in the World Blitz Chess Championship 2022 with a score of 15/21 behind Magnus Carlsen.


=== 2023: American Cup, Norway Chess and Bullet Chess ===

In February 2023, Nakamura finished as runner-up in the Airthings Masters, coming in second to Magnus Carlsen. In March, he secured his first over-the-board victory of the year at the American Cup, defeating GM Wesley So in the final.
Nakamura won the Chessable Masters in April during the Champions Chess Tour. He overcame Magnus Carlsen in the loser's bracket final and emerged victorious in two matches against Fabiano Caruana to win the grand final.
Nakamura won Norway Chess 2023 in June by beating Fabiano Caruana in the final round to finish the tournament ½ points in front of him, ending with a score of 16½/27. The tournament used an unusual scoring system that awarded 3 points for a win in the classical games and zero points for a loss in classical. If players drew their classical game, they played an Armageddon game. The Armageddon winner scored 1½ points and the loser scored 1 point. Nakamura's performance at the tournament also resulted in him being ranked No. 2 in FIDE's July rankings for the first time since 2015.
In July, Nakamura won his fourth Bullet Chess Championship title, defeating runner-up Magnus Carlsen in a tight Grand Final match.
Nakamura participated in the Chess World Cup 2023 in August, where he was second seeded. He received a bye win on the first round, won the second round on tiebreaks against Indian grandmaster Karthik Venkataraman with +0−0=2 in Classical and +1−0=1 in rapid, won the third round against Hungarian grandmaster Benjámin Gledura with 1½–½ score in the classical portion but ended up losing to the Indian Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa on tiebreaks with a score of 1–3 (two draws in classical portion and two losses in the rapid portion).
In October and November, Nakamura participated in the FIDE Grand Swiss 2023, finishing in second place with 8/11 points (+5−0=6) and thus qualifying for the Candidates Tournament 2024. Vladimir Kramnik made a statement on his Chess.com profile purportedly insinuating that an unnamed high-level player was cheating on November 20. Nakamura believed this post was targeted towards him, and responded with a statement on Twitter reading "Vladimir appears to be referencing my record...is he really accusing me of cheating??? [sic]". Nakamura also expressed disappointment with Ian Nepomniachtchi for reposting Kramnik's claims.
Nakamura played in the Champions Chess Tour Finals in December. He finished fifth in the eight-player field. He compiled a good record in the tournament's regular games (+6−3=9) but a poor showing in the Armageddon games (one win and five losses) prevented a higher finish. Throughout 2023 Nakamura frequently played in Chess.com's Titled Tuesday online blitz tournaments, which usually attracted strong fields, often including five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen. Nakamura led all players with 18 wins in the tournaments during 2023.


=== 2024: Candidates Tournament and Norway Chess ===

In April, Nakamura played in the Candidates Tournament 2024. He was touted as one of the favourites to win (alongside Fabiano Caruana) by former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Viswanathan Anand, but had a slow start to the tournament after losing to Vidit Gujrathi with the white pieces in the second round. During the eighth round, Nakamura defeated Caruana.
After losing to Vidit in the ninth round, Nakamura ran off three consecutive victories in rounds ten, eleven and twelve against Nijat Abasov, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Alireza Firouzja. This put him in a three-way tie for first place with Ian Nepomniachtchi and Gukesh Dommaraju. In the final two rounds of the tournament Nakamura was held to draws. He finished in second place with a record of 8½/14 (tied with Nepomniachtchi and Caruana on overall score but placing ahead of them due to tiebreaks: better Sonneborn–Berger score and more wins than Caruana, equal Sonneborn–Berger score but more wins than Nepomniachtchi.)
In May and June Nakamura competed in the Norway Chess tournament against five other grandmasters. He finished second with 15½ points behind Magnus Carlsen at 17½. The tournament was a double round-robin in classical chess, with an Armageddon playoff after each classical draw. A classical win counted for three points, a classical draw and Armageddon win counted for one-and-a-half points, a classical draw and Armageddon loss counted for one point, and a classical loss counted for zero points. Nakamura compiled a +2 record in classical games (+2−0=8) the same as Carlsen, but a better record in Armageddon playoffs gave Carlsen the victory, though Nakamura did defeat Carlsen in one of their individual Armageddon games.
Nakamura played in the online Chess.com Bullet Chess Championship in June. He defeated grandmasters Christopher Yoo (14½-4½), David Paravyan (13½-5½), Nihal Sarin (19–12) and Daniel Naroditsky (16½–11½) to reach the grand final. In a match marked by personal conflict and technical connection issues, he lost the double elimination final to Alireza Firouzja (17½–12½ and 12½–10½). In July Nakamura played in the online CrunchLabs Masters tournament on the Champions Chess Tour. He qualified with a 7/9 score in the Swiss play-in but lost a match to Jules Moussard (2–1) and was placed in Division Two of the tournament. He won against Bogdan-Daniel Deac (2½–1½), Maxim Matlakov (1½–½), Vasif Durarbayli (2–0), Vladimir Fedoseev (2–1) and a second match against Moussard (2–1). But he lost another match to Fedoseev (2½–1½) and then lost to Alexander Grischuk (2–1) and was eliminated from the tournament.
In August Nakamura participated as a wild card in the ten-player St. Louis Rapid and Blitz, part of the Grand Chess Tour. He compiled an even score in the rapid section of the tournament (+2−2=5) and a +3 score in the blitz section (+9−6=3). Overall he finished third in the tournament behind winner Alireza Firouzja and runner-up Wesley So. Nakamura played in Chess.com's Speed Chess Championship in August and September. He qualified for the in-person semifinals by defeating Jose Martinez (14–8) and Ian Nepomniachtchi (14½–9½) in online matches. He lost his semifinal match to Alireza Firouzja (16–11) but won the consolation match against Hans Niemann (21–9) to take third place in the tournament.
Nakamura played in the Global Chess League, a rapid-play team event held in London in October. Playing on the top board for the American Gambits team, he compiled a +2 record (+3−1=6) including wins against Alireza Firouzja, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Viswanathan Anand. His team finished fourth in the six-team tournament. Also in October Nakamura played the Chess 9LX tournament at the St. Louis Chess Club, a ten-player rapid round-robin event in Fischer random chess. His record of 7/9 (+6−1=2) earned second place, but his sole loss against tournament winner Fabiano Caruana cost him the chance at first.
The World Rapid and Blitz Championships in December were a disappointment for Nakamura. He finished with 7.5/13 in rapid (+5-3=5) and 8.5/13 in blitz (+6-2=5) to end well behind the leaders in both events. During 2024 Nakamura frequently played in Chess.com's online Titled Tuesday blitz tournaments. For the year he won more of the tournaments than any other player and earned the site's Titled Cup award for 2024, 4.5 points ahead of five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen.
During 2024, after further comments by Vladimir Kramnik alleging that Nakamura's online win streaks were suspicious, Chess.com asked statistician Jeff Rosenthal to examine Nakamura's results on the platform. Rosenthal later published a paper based on his analysis which concluded that "the observed streaks are comfortably within the range of statistical expectation" and "do not provide evidence of cheating or suspicious behavior".


=== 2025: American Cup and Freestyle Chess ===
Nakamura's first over-the-board event of 2025 was February's Freestyle Chess tournament in Weissenhaus, Germany. This ten-player Fischer Random event consisted of a rapid-play round-robin followed by a series of playoff matches, which were played at classical time limits with rapid and blitz tiebreakers if necessary. Nakamura placed fifth in the round-robin with a +3-1=5 record that included wins against Fabiano Caruana, Vincent Keymer and Vladimir Fedoseev. He then lost his playoff match against Javokhir Sindarov (2.5-1.5) but won matches against Gukesh Dommaraju (2.5-1.5) and Nodirbek Abdusattorov (2-0) to finish fifth in the tournament.
Also in February Nakamura played in the online double-elimination Chessable Masters rapid tournament on chess.com. He won matches against Alexander Grischuk (2.5-0.5), Ian Nepomniachtchi (3-0) and Alireza Firouzja (3-2) but lost in the winners bracket final to Magnus Carlsen (2.5-0.5). He then faced Nepomniachtchi again in the losers bracket final. The match went to an Armageddon game where he drew with black and thus earned the victory (1.5-1.5) and a rematch with Carlsen in the tournament grand final. Nakamura lost the rematch (2.5-1.5) to finish second in the tournament and qualify for the Esports World Cup.
In March Nakamura played in the six-player Champions Showdown at the Saint Louis Chess Club. This event consisted of matches with games at blitz, rapid and "semi-classical" (60 minutes for the game with a 15-second increment) time limits. Cash prizes were awarded for each game. Nakamura lost his match with Fabiano Caruana (2-1), won his match with Ray Robson (2-1) and drew his match with Levon Aronian (1.5-1.5). He finished fourth on the prize money list with $37,625.
Later in March Nakamura played in the American Cup, an eight-player double elimination tournament also held at the St. Louis Chess Club. The event featured matches with games at classical, rapid and blitz time limits. He defeated Abhimanyu Mishra (3.5-2.5), Leinier Dominguez (1.5-0.5) and Fabiano Caruana (2.5-1.5) to win the winners bracket. In the tournament grand final he beat Caruana again (1.5-0.5) to take first place in the event. He also won the subsequent American Cup Blitz tournament, a nine-round Swiss event at blitz time limits, which featured a large field of grandmasters and other strong players.
Nakamura continued a busy tournament schedule with April's Freestyle Chess tournament in Paris. In this Fischer Random event he placed sixth in the preliminary rapid-play round robin (+4-3=4) and then won knockout matches at classical time limits against Arjun Erigaisi (1.5-0.5) and Vincent Keymer (1.5-0.5) to reach the tournament grand final. He lost the final to Magnus Carlsen (1.5-0.5) to finish second in the event. In May Nakamura participated in the sixteen-player online Chess.com Classic. He won matches against Levon Aronian (3-2), Ding Liren (2.5-0.5) and Ian Nepomniachtchi (3-2) to reach the winners bracket final against Magnus Carlsen. He lost the match to Carlsen (3-1) and, in an odd turn of events, resigned a winning position against Carlsen in the fourth and final game. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave then beat Nakamura in the losers bracket final (1.5-0.5) in a match where a power outage in Nakamura's hotel affected play. He thus finished third in the tournament.
Nakamura's next event was Norway Chess 2025, held in May and June. This was an extremely strong tournament with five of the world's top six ranked players participating. The event was a six-player double round robin with its normal format of classical games followed by Armageddon playoffs in case of a draw. Nakamura compiled a +1 record in classical (+2-1=7) with victories against Fabiano Caruana and reigning world champion Gukesh Dommaraju. But his poor record in the Armageddon playoffs (two wins and five losses) meant that he finished fourth overall. He expressed satisfaction with the result because it cemented his place as the world's number-two ranked player in classical and thus improved his chances of earning the ratings spot in the 2026 Candidates tournament.
Later in June Nakamura played as part of team WR Chess in the World Rapid and Blitz Team Championships in London. He compiled strong records in rapid (+6-0=5) and blitz (+11-1=3), including wins against Anish Giri, Richard Rapport and Michael Adams. His team won the blitz title and finished fifth in rapid. In July Nakamura was one of sixteen players in the Fischer Random Freestyle event in Las Vegas. He placed first in the round robin in his group of eight with a +5-0=2 score, including wins against Hans Niemann and Arjun Erigaisi. He then lost his first knockout match to Levon Aronian (3-1), won matches against Wesley So (1.5-0.5) and Fabiano Caruana (3-1), and lost his final match to Magnus Carlsen (1.5-0.5) to finish fourth in the tournament.
Also in July Nakamura played in the sixteen-player rapid tournament as part of the Esports World Cup. In the group stage he defeated Javokhir Sindarov (2-0), lost in Armageddon to Alireza Firouzja (1.5-1.5) and won against Wei Yi (2-1). This qualified him for the final knockout phase, where he beat Levon Aronian (2.5-1.5), lost to Magnus Carlsen in Armageddon (4-3) and defeated Arjun Erigaisi (3.5-2.5) to take third place in the event.
Based on FIDE Regulations, in order to qualify for the 2026 Candidates Tournament based off rating, a player must have played at least 40 games calculated for FIDE Standard Rating Lists from February 1, 2025 till January 1, 2026. Due to this regulation, Nakamura did not meet the requirements to qualify for the Candidates Tournament as of August 1 and thus needed to play 22 additional games. From August 30 to September 1, Nakamura played in the 2025 Louisiana State Championship where he finished with a 7/7 score, improving his rating by 4.8 points. The following week, Nakamura participated in the 70th Iowa Open where he also achieved a perfect score of 5/5. His live rating increased to 2815.8, which when rounded to 2816 is equal to his peak rating which he achieved 10 years ago.
In October Nakamura played in the Checkmate: USA vs India event, where he defeated Gukesh Dommaraju (2-1) as part of the American team's overall 5-0 victory. This event was staged extravagantly with a large live crowd encouraged to cheer loudly during the games. After Nakamura defeated Gukesh in the final game, he picked up Gukesh's king from the board and tossed it into the crowd. Later in the month Nakamura played in the Comet Open, a 32-player double-elimination online blitz event. He won the tournament by defeating GMs Emin Ohanyan (2.5-0.5), Pranav V (2.5-1.5), Parham Maghsoodloo (3-2), Nihal Sarin (3-2), Dmitry Andreikin (3-1) and Denis Lazavik (2.5-1.5).


== Playing style ==
Nakamura is particularly skilled at rapid and blitz chess, a variety of time controls in which players have less than an hour to complete all or most of their moves. In August 2022, Nakamura was ranked No. 1 on both the FIDE blitz list and the FIDE rapid list. He is also strong at bullet chess, a time control giving the players one minute each. In 2009, Nakamura authored the book Bullet Chess: One Minute to Mate. Nakamura said in September 2020, "At least at blitz chess, I'm probably the best or second-best player ever, in the entire history, at least online."
Nakamura has been nicknamed "The H Bomb" because of his explosive style of playing. Nakamura's long-time second is USCF National Master Kris Littlejohn, who works with chess engines to prepare lines for Nakamura to play.


== Chess records ==
Nakamura has set several "youngest-ever" records in U.S. chess history, including:

He plays speed chess games, variously against grandmasters, other streamers, and viewers who pay to subscribe to his channel. He may play blindfolded or with piece handicaps, such as odds of a queen. He also reviews his tournament games on stream. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, chess became significantly more popular on Twitch, with Nakamura widely identified as a significant reason for this. His channel received a tenfold increase in audience size between February and June 2020. Around August 2020, Nakamura averaged 14,000 concurrent viewers and streamed on Twitch most days. By September 2020, he had reached 500,000 followers. As of September 2025, the channel has reached 2 million followers.

Nakamura also has a YouTube channel, which has 3,010,000 subscribers as of September 2025, up from 78,900 subscribers in the beginning of 2020. When asked about his popularity online, Nakamura attributed it to "the ability to play extremely high-level chess" while "seemingly ... not focused on the game" and conversing with his viewers. Nathan Grayson of Kotaku called it a "combination of teacherly wisdom, galaxy-brained skills, and uncommon expressiveness".
Nakamura has also coached beginner chess players on his Twitch platform, including the streamer xQc. He gave lessons to players in PogChamps, an amateur tournament for Twitch streamers hosted by Chess.com, and its sequel, PogChamps 2. He additionally provided commentary. At its peak, the tournament was the most-watched channel on Twitch for a short period, with 63,000 viewers. Nakamura told Kotaku that though the competition had been met with some criticism, he believed that such tournaments with varying levels of skills among players could become popular. On February 14, 2021, PogChamps 3 began. During the xQc vs. Rubius match on the second day of the event, chess hit its all-time high of 115,000 viewers in the chess category on Twitch.
On February 14, 2021, Nakamura reached a milestone of one million followers on his Twitch channel, GMHikaru.
