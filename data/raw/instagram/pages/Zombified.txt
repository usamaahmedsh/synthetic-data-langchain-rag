== Composition and lyrics ==
"Zombified" is a song written by Ronnie Radke, John Lundin, and Cody Quistad. The song's lyrics are a stand against cancel culture, wherein celebrities or popular online personalities get "cancelled" for certain actions, regardless of how long ago said actions were, and whether or not the offender had changed as a person. The song was composed by Ronnie Radke with a "rock anthem" influence. About this single Ronnie explains why he wrote the song: I wrote "Zombified" about how sensitive society has gotten, in my opinion. I think we all need to learn to laugh a little more. I pulled out all the stops for the "Zombified" video, for the fans, YouTube reactors, and all people alike.


== Music video ==
The music video for the song was directed by Jensen Noen who had already directed the band's music videos for other songs such as "Popular Monster", "The Drug in Me Is Reimagined", and "I'm Not a Vampire (Revamped)". The music video shows Falling in Reverse fending off against zombies in a post apocalyptic world. The music video won Best of Festival - Music Video at the 2022 Richmond International Film Festival.
