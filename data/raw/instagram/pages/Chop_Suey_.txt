"Chop Suey!" is a song by the American heavy metal band System of a Down. It was released on August 13, 2001, as the first single from their second album, Toxicity (2001). The single earned the band its first Grammy nomination in 2002 for Best Metal Performance at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. "Chop Suey!" is often considered the band's signature song. Its music video has reached one billion views on YouTube.


== Music and lyrics ==
The song's lyrics have been described as surrealist. In an interview, System of a Down's guitarist, Daron Malakian, explained, "The song is about how we are regarded differently depending on how we pass. Everyone deserves to die. Like, if I were now to die from drug abuse, they might say I deserved it because I abused dangerous drugs. Hence the line, 'I cry when angels deserve to die.'" The lyrics for the midsection ("Father into your hands I commend my spirit", from the sayings of Jesus on the cross) were randomly picked by the singer, Serj Tankian, from the producer Rick Rubin's book collection after Tankian was struggling for ideas. 
Musically, the song is characterized by "sonic whiplash," containing what are described as "slash-and-burn verses and a surprisingly melodic chorus." Serj Tankian's vocal delivery has been said to have the "precision of a drill sergeant."


== Song title ==
The song was originally titled either "Suicide" (according to the bassist, Shavo Odadjian) or "Self-Righteous Suicide" (according to producer Rick Rubin), but the name was changed in response to real or anticipated pushback from Columbia Records. According to online interview with Odadjian, the song title is a wordplay as he said: "Chop Suey" is "suicide" "chopped" in half. Most pressings of the album include an intro to the track where the singer, Serj Tankian, can be heard saying "we're rolling 'Suicide'" while the drummer, John Dolmayan, is counting the band in.


== Music video ==
The music video was the band's first collaboration with the director Marcos Siega, and is set in the parking lot of the Oak Tree Inn Motel, 5265 W Sunset Boulevard, in Los Angeles, hometown of the band. The members are performing the song on stage, surrounded by approximately 1,500 fans. Editing devices are used to create the effect of the band members "walking through" one another and teleporting on and off the stage. One scene briefly shows Tankian eating chop suey with some fans, the only reference to the title dish in either the song or the video. The video makes use of the SnorriCam technique, in which an actor will have a camera attached to them with a harness, making it appear as though the background is moving and the actor is stationary. In the middle of the video, the Armenian Flag can be seen. The video reached one billion views on YouTube in November 2020.


== Reception ==
Loudwire included the song in its list of "The Best Hard Rock Songs of the 21st Century", where it was ranked at number one. Loudwire and Kerrang! both named it as System of a Down's best song. In March 2023, Rolling Stone ranked "Chop Suey!" at number 37 on their "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time" list. As of September 2025, "Chop Suey!" has 1.7 billion streams on Spotify, making it System of a Down's most-streamed song.


== Controversy ==
"Chop Suey!" was the first single from Toxicity, an album that was at number one on the Billboard 200 chart during the week of the September 11 attacks. A controversy surrounding the single, especially the line '"I don't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide"', at the time led to Clear Channel Radio placing the song on a list of post-9/11 inappropriate titles. Although it was never actually banned from the air, radio stations were advised against playing any of the songs on the list.

== Commercial performance ==
"Chop Suey!" was a moderate success on the charts. In Australia, after hitting No. 3 on the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2001, with virtually no airplay on commercial radio, it debuted and peaked at No. 14 in February 2002. It is System of a Down's highest-charting single in Australia. In the United States, the song peaked at No. 76, making it the band's lowest peaking song on the Billboard Hot 100 due to the fact it was taken off the radio for its political lyrics. On the Modern Rock Tracks chart, "Chop Suey!" peaked at No. 7, becoming the band's first top ten single. On the UK Singles Chart, it debuted and peaked at No. 17.
