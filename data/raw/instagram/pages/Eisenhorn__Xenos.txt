== Plot ==
The gameplay centers around the Inquisition that moves amongst mankind like an avenging shadow, striking down the enemies of humanity with complete ruthlessness. Imperial inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn (voiced by Mark Strong) faces a vast interstellar cabal and the dark power of daemons, all racing to recover an arcane text of supreme and abominable power — an ancient tome known as the Necroteuch.


== Reception ==

Eisenhorn: Xenos received "generally unfavorable" reviews for Microsoft Windows and "mixed or average" reviews for iOS.
The game's graphics, combat system and controls were criticized; in addition, it was hard for some players to understand the plot without knowledge of the original novel.
