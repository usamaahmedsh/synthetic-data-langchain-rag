Bailrigg FM (formerly known as University Radio Bailrigg (URB) and Radio Bailrigg) is a student radio station at Lancaster University. It operates in a music format predominantly featuring pop, but also broadcasts news, drama, comedy, and entertainment. During evening and weekend hours, programming moves to specialist content where presenters are free (within reason) to play whatever they wish.
Bailrigg is one of the oldest student radio stations in the country, as well as being the first student station to broadcast on FM. It airs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all year round. Bailrigg first broadcast on FM as part of a one-month, 25W Restricted Service Licence in March 1994 under the directorship of Paul Dale. It had previously applied for a licence in September 1993 but was turned down by the Radio Authority due to the launch of The Bay in March of that year.
It originally broadcast to the university on 312m Medium Wave using an inductive loop aerial system around the various halls of residence. Now listeners can tune in on campus on 95.3 MHz, or listen anywhere in the world using the station's live webstream. Bailrigg FM holds several large events throughout the year, including a seven-day Freshers' Week outside broadcast and coverage of the Lancaster University Students' Union (LUSU) sabbatical elections. During the Roses Tournament the station joins with University Radio York (URY) to provide programming across both campuses.
The station has received several national Student Radio Awards over the years, including Best Website, Best Station Sound and more recently Best Technical Achievement.


== History ==


=== Pirate Radio at Lancaster University ===
Following students at the University of York getting permission to test-transmit programs on medium wave in 1968, a couple of Lancaster University physics students started negotiations with the university to start a similar project. However, progress of the project was pushed back after an over-eager student started his own pirate radio station called Radio 220.


=== University Radio Bailrigg (1969–1996) ===
In the summer of 1969, following permission from the university, a small loop aerial and a low power transmitter was built to test the feasibility of a student radio project at Lancaster. After multiple bids for funding, University Radio Bailrigg (URB) received £1,000 funding from the student union and was able to install studio equipment in January 1971. Test transmission began in the March of that year.
The Government of the United Kingdom forced URB off air due to the station broadcasting without a full license in November 1972. However, after being issued a license, it returned to air in 1973 with new transmission equipment. URB would broadcast on 963 kHz on AM. By 1974, URB had received £2,000 in funding from the university which meant that twin studios were able to be built in Fylde College.
In 1994, URB became the first student radio station to be issued an FM Restricted Service License, to broadcast on 87.7 MHz for four weeks. The broadcasts covered the City of Lancaster (including Morecambe), with reception reported as far afield as Preston, Blackpool and Barrow-in-Furness. A second four-week FM licence is received in 1995, again broadcasting on 87.7 MHz.


=== Bailrigg FM (1996–present) ===
Due to high repair costs of the medium wave loop induction system, URB opted to start broadcasting permanently on FM on 19 January 1996, and rebranded to 'Bailrigg FM'.
In 2004 Bailrigg FM was awarded an extended licence to transmit across Lancaster and Morecambe for a week as part of the university's 40th anniversary celebrations. Bailrigg FM moved into its current studios in Furness College in 2006. As part of the university's Alumni Fund, it received £8,500 in funding to purchase outside broadcast equipment.
In 2013 Bailrigg FM was awarded £65,000 in Capex funds from LUSU in order to renovate their studios.
It was announced by LUSU that Bailrigg FM would be stripped of funding for its license due to "organisation sustainability" plans. Due to widespread disapproval this decision was ultimately reversed.
On 7 December 2022, after almost 17 years of broadcasting on 87.7 MHz, Bailrigg FM's FM license was amended, changing its frequency to 95.3 MHz.
