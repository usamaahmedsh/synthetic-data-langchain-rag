Hinder is an American rock band from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, formed in 2001 by former lead singer Austin John Winkler, guitarist Joe "Blower" Garvey, drummer Cody Hanson, with bass player Cole Parker being recruited in 2002 during the recording of their debut EP Far from Close. Upon Parker's exit from the group in 2003, Hinder recruited bassist Mike Rodden and former guitarist Mark King to join the band in 2004. The band released four studio albums with Winkler; Extreme Behavior (2005), Take It to the Limit (2008), All American Nightmare (2010) and Welcome to the Freakshow (2012). Cody Hanson, along with former lead singer Austin Winkler, wrote the majority of the band's music on their first four albums. After Winkler left the band in 2013, they looked for a new lead vocalist, and added Marshal Dutton. They have since released When the Smoke Clears (2015) and The Reign (2017) with their new vocalist. The band was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2007.
The band's latest album Back to Life was released on May 23, 2025 via Evil Teen Records, marking their first new album in 7 years.


== History ==


=== Formation and Far from Close: 2001–2004 ===
Before the band formed, Austin John Winkler sang in an Oklahoma City cover band until July 2001, when he met drummer Cody Hanson and lead guitarist Joe Garvey at a college party. Soon after, the three formed Hinder. Hanson commented on Winkler shortly after the band formed, saying he was "blown away" and "he has the kind of charisma very few people have and that unique voice. You can't really compare him to anybody." After recruiting bassist Cole Parker, they recorded a four-track demo disc with the track listing "Someday", "Like Me", "Broken", and "Worthless Home". The tracks "Someday" and "Broken" would later be re-recorded and put on their debut EP Far from Close and the other two tracks "Like Me" and "Worthless Home" still remain unreleased, only being able to find them on their demo CDs, although they are now posted on YouTube.
The band began performing at an Oklahoma City club called The Blue Note, building a local fan base. Profits from the shows went to advertising, as well as paying the expenses for the group's first release. In April 2003, Hinder entered the March Bandness contest for Oklahoma City radio station KHBZ-FM (94.7). They made it to the Final Four out of a field of 32, ultimately losing to the OKC group Falcon Five-O.
After saving enough money from local concerts, the band's debut EP Far from Close was released in 2003 on the independent label Brickden Records and sold around 5,000 copies. Bassist Mike Rodden was recruited from Oklahoma City band Shade Seven and rhythm guitarist Mark King joined the band later that year.


=== Extreme Behavior and Take It to the Limit: 2005–2009 ===

After the release of Far from Close, Hinder was offered record deals by Atlantic Records, Roadrunner Records, and Universal Records, eventually signing with Universal Records in 2005. Later that year, their major-label debut album, Extreme Behavior, was released. It was produced by Brian Howes, who, along with Cody Hanson and Austin Winkler, wrote most of the material on the album. The album was engineered by Mike Fraser and Jay Van Poederooyen. The album reached triple-platinum, indicating sales of over 3 million units in the U.S.
Hinder toured and released singles in support of their first album. The group's debut single, "Get Stoned", was released in October 2005. The second single, "Lips of an Angel", entered charts in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore; the song lasted for 41 weeks in the New Zealand charts, two weeks of which were spent at the number one spot. The band's third single, "How Long", was released in September 2006 and appeared at number six on the U.S. Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Their second song to be released in New Zealand was "Better Than Me", which spent three weeks on the New Zealand charts, peaking at number 16. In 2007, Hinder was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame, and in October of the same year, the band released their limited edition CD/DVD of Extreme Behavior entitled You Can't Make This S**t Up.
The first single from the band's second album, "Use Me", was released on July 15, 2008, and peaked at No. 3 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The second album, Take It to the Limit, was released on November 4, 2008; the album marked a change in style in Hinder's music in that it moved the band in a slightly more glam metal-influenced direction. The title track features Mötley Crüe's Mick Mars on guitar. They announced the release of the album's second single, "Without You", through their MySpace page on September 13, 2008. Take It to the Limit debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with 81,000 sales its first week and ended up going Gold in the U.S.
Through late 2008, Hinder headlined the Jägermeister Music Tour with Trapt and Rev Theory also on the bill. In early 2009, the group embarked on Mötley Crüe's Saints of Los Angeles Tour, which also included Theory of a Deadman and The Last Vegas. In July, Hinder embarked on Nickelback's Dark Horse Tour, which ran through Live Nation outdoor amphitheaters; other bands involved were Papa Roach, Breaking Benjamin, and Saving Abel. On March 27, 2013 Take It to the Limit was certified gold in the U.S.


=== All American Nightmare, Welcome to the Freakshow and Winkler's departure: 2010–2013 ===
During early 2010, the band was engaged in writing and recording material for their third album, titled All American Nightmare. It was released on December 7, 2010, with the first single, the title track, released on September 14, 2010. Although the album was originally planned to be produced by Howard Benson, Kevin Churko was later announced to be the producer.
Winkler said that the group started recording during the touring cycle for Take It to the Limit. "We wrote 70 or so songs, recorded about 50 and cut it down to 12", the singer explained. "It's something that we've never done before, so it's like our ultimate baby. A lot of the [other] songs could be shit, too, we don't know. You don't really know until you put it out there and have more than two people's opinion on it." Both he and drummer Cody Hanson mentioned the song "Memory" as one that was a strong contender for the final cut. "It's about being with your chick – the chick you've been with for a while, not some chick you've met on the road – and about being able to still have a good time with your wife or long-time girlfriend", said Hanson. "I've been in a relationship myself for nine years, so it was cool to write a song like that."
On August 9, 2012, Hinder announced that their next album would be titled Welcome to the Freakshow. It was released on December 4, 2012. Hinder released their first single, "Save Me", on August 30. On July 10, 2013, it was announced that lead singer Austin Winkler had entered rehab, and would not be touring with the band for the remainder of the year.
