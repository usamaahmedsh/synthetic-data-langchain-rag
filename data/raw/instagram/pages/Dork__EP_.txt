Dork / Stick Around is a split extended play by American punk rock bands AFI and Loose Change (which featured future AFI guitarist Jade Puget), released on March 2, 1993, on Key Lime Pie Records and Wilson House Records.
This was AFI's first release, put out within a year of the band's formation, and was limited to around 200 copies. The cover is a picture of AFI drummer Adam Carson. "NyQuil" was written by then-bassist Vic Chalker, and was re-recorded for the band's first full-length album, Answer That and Stay Fashionable.
Counterfeits were sold on eBay for at least a year, which prompted former AFI bassist Geoff Kresge to reveal their inauthenticity. Kresge himself reissued AFI's Dork with an added outtake on September 29, 2017, without the current band's consent.
