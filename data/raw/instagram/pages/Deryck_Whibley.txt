== Career ==


=== Sum 41 ===

Whibley formed Sum 41 with bassist Grant McVittie. After several lineup changes, the band consisted of Whibley, Steve Jocz, Dave Baksh and Jason McCaslin. In 1999, the band signed an international record deal with Island Records. The band released their debut EP, Half Hour of Power in 2000, then an album, All Killer No Filler, in 2001. The band achieved mainstream success with their first single from the album, "Fat Lip", which reached number-one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and remains the band's most successful single to date. All Killer No Filler was certified platinum in the United States, Canada and in the UK. The band has since released six more studio albums: Does This Look Infected? (2002), Chuck (2004), Underclass Hero (2007), Screaming Bloody Murder (2011), 13 Voices (2016), Order in Decline (2019), and Heaven :x: Hell (2024). The three albums before Screaming Bloody Murder have been certified platinum in Canada. Aside from vocals and guitar, Whibley played drums and went by the name Gunner for the Sum 41 alter-ego heavy metal band Pain For Pleasure, where the members of Sum 41 would parody a 1980s metal band. Whibley would later switched to guitar after Frank Zummo became part of the alter-ego band.
The band often performed more than 300 times each year and held long global tours, most of which lasted more than a year. They have been nominated for seven Juno Awards and have won twice (Group of the Year in 2002 and Rock Album of the Year for Chuck in 2005). During the Screaming Bloody Murder Tour, the band added Whibley's cousin Matt Whibley on keyboard.

According to Whibley, he met Nori at age 16, when the latter was 34. He alleged that the manager offered him drugs and accused him of homophobia when he attempted to end their relationship. Nori, who has denied the allegations, hired a defamation lawyer in response. He was fired as the band's manager in 2005, at Whibley's request. Nori is the co-lead vocalist of Treble Charger.

Whibley has chronic back pain due to a series of back injuries, starting with a slipped disc during a 2007 concert.
