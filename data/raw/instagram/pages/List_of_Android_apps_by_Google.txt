This is a list of mobile apps developed by Google for its Android operating system. All of these apps are available for free from the Google Play Store, although some may be incompatible with certain devices (even though they may still function from an APK file) and some apps are only available on Pixel and/or Nexus devices. Some of these apps may be pre-installed on some devices, depending upon the device manufacturer and the version of Android. A few, such as Gboard, are not supported on older versions of Android.
