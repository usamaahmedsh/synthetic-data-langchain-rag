JetAudio is a shareware media player application for Microsoft Windows and Android released in 1997 which offers playback options for a wide range of multimedia file formats.  JetAudio is popular and well-rated for its interface, and its download count at CNET approaches 28 million downloads.
JetAudio offers functions such as music and video playback, metadata editing, CD ripping and burning, data conversion, sound recording, and Internet radio broadcasting. It also includes numerous sound effects.
The commercial “Plus VX” version of the application includes unlocked sound enhancement algorithms and a wide range of file format support, as well as the ability to transcode more than 30 seconds of video files.


== Interface ==

JetAudio’s user interface is similar to earlier versions of Winamp in that it features separate windows for: playback, playlist and music library. Like Winamp, JetAudio can be minimized to a toolbar ( “Windowshade Mode”) by pressing the “Toolbar Mode ON/OFF” button in the upper right portion of the Main Window.
The interface includes a 10-band spectrum visualization which doubles as an equalizer. Different implementations of this spectrum visualization can be found in the Main Window, the Media Center, the Video Window, the Lyrics Viewer and the External Spectrum Viewer.
