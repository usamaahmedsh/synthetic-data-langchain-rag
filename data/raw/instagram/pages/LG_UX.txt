LG UX is an Android-based mobile operating system developed and maintained by LG Electronics independently of Google exclusively for its smartphones.
There are different versions for each LG phone, and each version has variants according to the regions in which the phone is sold, such as China, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, Indonesia, India, Taiwan and Turkey.
The original name of LG UX is Optimus UI, and was given the current name with the launch of the LG G4 and the release of LG UX 4.0, with older versions retroactively renamed LG UX.
