One UI is a user interface (UI) developed by Samsung Electronics for its mobile, computing devices and TVs, including Android devices running Android 9 "Pie" and later.
The successor to Samsung Experience, Samsung designed One UI to make using larger smartphones easier and be more visually appealing. It was announced and unveiled at Samsung Developer Conference in 2018, and was updated in Galaxy Unpacked in February 2019 alongside the Galaxy S10 series, Galaxy Buds and the Galaxy Fold, since then receiving yearly upgrades.
The latest stable version, One UI 8, was released on July 25, 2025 with the launch of the Galaxy Z Fold7, Flip7 and Flip7 FE, with other phones expected to receive the update from September 2025 onwards starting from Galaxy S25 series.


== Features ==
One UI was designed as part of a goal to make Samsung's hardware and software "work together in perfect harmony" and provide a more "natural" experience on large-screen smartphones. One UI displays most of the features that were in the Samsung Experience UX. A prominent design pattern in many of Samsung's system applications is to intentionally place common features and user interface elements along the middle of the screen rather than near the top. This makes them easier to reach with a user's thumb when using the device one-handed.
For similar reasons, apps use large headers to push their main content towards the vertical center of the screen. The navigation bar supports the use of gestures and the usual 3-button system, while a system-wide "night mode" was also added (which gives UI elements and supported applications a darkened color scheme). As with Android Pie upstream, the Overview screen of recent apps uses a horizontal layout, as opposed to the vertical layout of previous versions.


=== One UI Core ===
One UI Core was a slimmed down version of the original One UI feature set aimed towards the lower-end models of the A, F, M, and J series' devices. Devices running One UI Core typically have a reduced set of features compared to the full version of One UI. One UI Core hasn't been made available to those low-end devices since the release of One UI 6, and devices previously running One UI Core were instead given full One UI software with limited features with the update to version 6.


=== Default apps and components ===

The following is a list of Samsung's own software and functionalities that are included with One UI (as of version 7.0). Not all of them are preinstalled and available for all devices, with some regional differences also.

Additional Samsung apps and components for One UI are offered on the Galaxy Store, such as Samsung Flow, and Good Lock.
Since One UI devices running Android use Google's version of the OS, numerous Google Mobile Services components also ship with the devices, except in Mainland China.


=== Typefaces ===

When One UI launched in 2019, the default system font continued to be the Google-developed Roboto. As before, Samsung have pre-installed their own Samsung Sans typeface and the "fun" typefaces Choco Cooky, Cool Jazz and Rosemary as options. One UI also introduced an additional pre-installed font, SamsungOne, a lighter typeface that was originally released in 2016 as an option from the Galaxy Store. 

With the release of One UI 6.0 in 2023, Roboto was replaced as the default system font by a new typeface, One UI Sans. Roboto continues to be pre-installed as an option, now under its own name.


== History ==


=== One UI ===


==== Overview ====


==== One UI 1 ====
One UI 1.0 is the first version of One UI and is based on Android 9 Pie. It brought about many features which were becoming increasingly popular among various apps. Dark mode (then named Night mode) was one key feature added to make viewing in dark spaces easier on the user's eyes. This feature was included in many apps and eventually brought to iOS 13 and Android 10. The first version also brought native screenshot editing tools, refined curves, refinements to the Always-On Display (tap to show), an upgraded Bixby with support for remapping the Bixby button, and a new way to navigate the device: gestures released on 19 December 2018.
While Android 9 Pie did come with gesture support, it was not available on Samsung devices and is said to be 'half baked' by many users. However, Samsung decided to create their own gesture system to navigate devices with One UI installed. To achieve this, the user has to swipe up from the bottom of the device in the three locations of the 'buttons' to navigate. The gesture system has received mixed reviews. The incoming call screen got refinements. One UI 1.0 was released on 7 November 2018.
One UI 1.1 brought stability fixes and performance optimizations, primarily for the camera, fingerprint reader, and facial recognition. One UI 1.1 was released alongside the Galaxy S10 series. This is the first version of One UI to be included as part of newer Samsung Galaxy devices since 2019. Later releases required some devices from 2018.
One UI 1.5 provided a native screen recorder, a "Power Mode" for higher system performance and exclusive early access Link to Windows support in cooperation with Microsoft. It was launched with the Galaxy Note 10 series devices on 12 August 2019. It was included with select Galaxy A series devices from 2019, Galaxy Tab S6 and Tab Active Pro.
Although Samsung Experience was rebranded to One UI in late 2018, some apps like Settings or the Calendar still identify One UI 1.0–1.5 as Samsung Experience. This would be corrected with One UI 2 as the Samsung Experience name would later fade away with the release of Android 10 for those supported devices. Additionally, app versions were 10.x and with each generation of One UI, the version of apps in incremented


==== One UI 2 ====
One UI 2.0 is the second version of One UI and is powered by Android 10. It provides Galaxy users with a skinned Digital Wellbeing experience, a more refined UI in some default apps such as Device Care, a minor UI change to the clock position in quick settings, a native screen recorder, the new Android 10 gesture system, Dynamic Lock Screen (different wallpaper with every unlock), a Trash folder in Files, native Android Auto, sound themes and harder Location permission access. The incoming call screen got improvements, including the phone icons. One UI 2.0 was officially released for the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 series on 7 November 2019 with other devices received the update thereafter.
One UI 2.1 brought support for 120 Hz refresh rate, Quick Share, Music Share, additional camera modes, and native support for Live Captions. It was first released with the Galaxy S20 series & the Galaxy Z Flip. It also arrived for older devices such as the Galaxy S9 and S10, Note 9 and Note 10, the Galaxy Fold, and select Galaxy A series devices as a software update on 24 February 2020.
One UI 2.5 was initially released on 24 August 2020 with the launch of the Galaxy Note 20 series, with the update later being released to select supported devices. It doesn't bring radical changes to the UI, but there are plenty of new feature additions to the camera, DeX, gesture navigation, and other services.


==== One UI 3 ====
One UI 3.0, the third version of One UI and based on Android 11, was released for Galaxy S20 devices beginning on 2 December 2020 after starting beta testing in August. This version includes a few noteworthy improvements, such as a translucent notification panel, brief notifications, new volume controls positioned on the right or left of the device alongside the physical volume keys, slightly enhanced widgets, redesigned incoming call screen, and smoother animations and transitions throughout the whole UI among other features. Blue Light Filter has been renamed to Eye Comfort Shield.
One UI 3.1 first released with the Galaxy S21 series, has started rolling out to other supported Galaxy devices, starting with the Galaxy S20 series on 17 February 2021. There are no notable user interface changes. It contains many new camera feature improvements such as improved touch autofocus and auto exposure controller and improved Single Take feature and software implementations such as Object Eraser, Multi Mic Recording, Private Share and others. This is the first version to replace the built-in messages app with Google's version however, this only applies to phones released in 2021 with Android 11 or later and the older phones, messages app provided by Samsung that have been present since the beginning of TouchWiz still remain to this day. Older devices such as the S10 and S20 remain unaffected and do not include Google's messages app.
One UI 3.1.1 first released with the Galaxy Z Fold 3 on 11 August 2021, although this first appeared with the Galaxy Tab S7 FE on 18 June 2021. It made multitasking easier with enhanced multi-window and task-switching features and also optimized more apps to take advantage of the large screen devices such as foldables and tablets. The new features were rolled out to all supported devices but devices that neither are classified as foldable phones nor tablets continued to show their software version as One UI 3.1 after the update, so now unlike the previous and next releases of One UI, this version was only available to foldable phones and tablets.


==== One UI 4 ====
One UI 4.0, based on Android 12, started beta testing on 19 July 2021, as the fourth generation of One UI. It was publicly released to the Galaxy S21 series first starting 15 November 2021 with other supported devices following in January 2022. This version focuses on customization, privacy, and access to Samsung's expanding ecosystem.
One UI 4.1 was first released with the Galaxy S22 series. It brought minor changes; however, it did introduce features like Smart Calendar, added option to choose how much virtual RAM is desired (from 2, 4, 6 or 8 GB), redesigned palette picker, Smart Widgets, separate Left/Right audio balance, extra brightness toggle, Pro Mode on more cameras, Night Mode portraits, and other minor changes.
One UI 4.1.1 is based on Android 12L which optimized the Android OS for alternative form factors such as foldables. It first released with the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 on August 23, 2022. This update also adds further Samsung specific enhancements to multitasking and optimizations for foldable smartphones (Galaxy Z Fold line) and large screen tablets (Galaxy Tab line). The new features made it to supported bar-type phones but these phones continued to show the software version as 4.1 after the update like One UI 3.1.1 as it was only available to foldable phones and tablets.


==== One UI 5 ====
One UI 5.0, based on Android 13, was announced on 12 October 2022, as the fifth generation of One UI. It was officially released for the Galaxy S22 series first starting 28 October 2022 with other devices received the update months or weeks afterwards depending on the country.
Some features and changes include the ability to turn off the RAM Plus feature, where previously users could only limit it to 2 GB rather than turning it off entirely, and a redesigned way of customizing the lock screen, similar to iOS 16. Material You was also expanded to most of Google and Samsung apps along with some third-party apps that support Material You. One UI 5 also brought refreshed icons with a slight gradient and subtle differences.
One UI 5.1 was announced on 1 February 2023 and released on 13 February 2023 with the Galaxy S23 series. It brought many new multitasking features, weather, new battery widget, Settings and Spotify suggestions, Camera and Gallery features, as well as improvements such as the ability to change color tone for selfies, enhanced image remastering, and revamped info display.
One UI 5.1.1 launched with the Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Tab S9 on 26 July 2023. The update increases the number of apps shown in the taskbar with more recent apps, improves support for Flex Mode in more apps, allows for two-handed drag-and-drop file transfer and gives the ability to hide apps in pop-up mode among other features and improvements. Even though other features made it to non-foldable phones, the latter devices continued showing their software version as 5.1 after the update like One UI versions 3.1.1 and 4.1.1 as it was only available to foldable phones and tablets.


==== One UI 6 ====
One UI 6.0 is based on Android 14. It was officially released for the Galaxy S23 series starting 30 October 2023 with other devices received the update after several weeks or months depending on the country.
The update includes a redesigned quick panel with a new button layout, improved access to the brightness settings and a new notification layout that allows sorting by time. Other new features include a new default font, called One UI Sans, new emojis and an improved multitasking experience. Built-in Samsung applications such as the Camera app, Gallery, Photo Editor, Weather among others have also received updates to add more functionality and customization.
One UI 6.1 was released on 17 January 2024 with the Galaxy S24 series. This and later versions of One UI mainly include new AI-based features that are available only on flagship devices sold in 2022 and later. These features are marketed as "Galaxy AI" and rely on a combination of local models and cloud-based models. In mainland China, the cloud partner is Baidu providing its Ernie model, while in international markets (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), the cloud partner is Google providing its Gemini Pro model.
Features available on all applicable devices include enhanced battery protection designed to prevent battery degradation, Super HDR for photos in the Gallery and on social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, and the option to show the lock screen wallpaper on Always On Display. Simultaneously the merger of Samsung's Quick Share and Google's Nearby Share feature were announced allowing all Galaxy users fast file transfer with all Android and Windows devices using a single solution.
While not released alongside One UI 6.1, Samsung implemented Google's A/B seamless update technology with the release of the Galaxy A55. This works by installing updates to a secondary system partition that the device boots from whenever it is restarted.
One UI 6.1.1 was released on 10 July 2024 with Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6. This update includes several new Galaxy AI features such as Portrait Studio, Suggested Replies and Sketch to Image. Other devices received the update thereafter starting with the Galaxy S24 series. However, non-foldable phones continued to show the software version as 6.1 after the update like One UI 3.1.1, 4.1.1 and 5.1.1 as it was only available to foldable phones and tablets.


==== One UI 7 ====
One UI 7.0 was released on 22 January 2025 with the S25 series and is based on Android 15. It was also publicly released as an update to the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy Z6 series first starting on 11 April 2025 with varying release dates depending on the country.
The update features a complete revamp of the One UI experience, marking its first major change in the history of One UI. The icons, widgets, camera app, and lock screen have all been redesigned; the quick panel has been separated into two by default (the notification panel and the control panel), though it can be reverted into the old layout. Samsung Messages has been removed on US Galaxy models in favor of Google Messages providing RCS support. However, it still available as an optional download on the Galaxy Store. DeX for PC and downloadable edge panels are deprecated in this release in favor for Link to Windows and third party alternatives. New ringtones and notification sounds are added for the first time since the release of the Galaxy S10 series.
One UI 7 also integrated Galaxy AI across supported devices. Features included Circle to Search, Live Translate, Interpreter, Note Assist, and Transcript Assist, alongside new tools such as Now Bar, Now Brief, and AI Select. Generative Edit, first introduced in earlier versions, was updated in One UI 7 using the Samsung Vision Model app, a background system component for editing and recognition features, Instant Slow-mo, introduced earlier, remained available in One UI 7. A new setting was added to allow users to choose between on-device and cloud-based AI processing. Integration with Google Gemini was also added, allowing the assistant to be launched by long-pressing the side button and used in conjunction with features such as Circle to Search.
Starting with this version, Samsung introduced One UI as the default interface on its Tizen-based smart TVs, monitors, projectors, and home appliances.
As of June 2025, the stable rollout of One UI 7 in almost all of existing devices has made its way to most countries. The Galaxy S25 series, A25 (Japan variant), A06 5G, A26, A36, A56, M06 (LTE/5G), F06 5G (LTE/5G), M16 (LTE/5G), M56, F16 (LTE/5G), XCover7 Pro, Tab S10 FE/FE+ and Tab Active5 Pro are the only devices have One UI 7 pre-installed.

=== One UI Watch ===
In 2021, Samsung and Google announced the wearable version of Tizen and Wear OS were being merged.


== Software support ==
Prior to the release of One UI, Samsung only provided just 2 years of OS upgrades and 3 or 4 years of security updates for most of its devices. Since then, they've extended software support multiple times:

It first began on 5 August 2020 (announced during the Galaxy Unpacked event unveiling the Galaxy Note20 series), which it offered 3 years of OS (and One UI) upgrades and 4 years of security updates.
Then on 9 February 2022 (also announced during the Galaxy Unpacked event unveiling the Galaxy S22 series), they increased update support to 4 years of OS (and One UI) upgrades and 5 years of security updates.
And then on 17 January 2024 (announced during the Galaxy Unpacked Event unveiling the Galaxy S24 series), it began offering 7 years of both OS upgrade and security updates for its flagship devices, becoming the second manufacturer to offer 7 years of support (the first brand to do so was Google with the release of the Pixel 8 lineup).
While not announced in any Unpacked event, Samsung quietly extended software support for its low-end and mid-range devices from 2025 onwards:

It started with 6 years of OS and security updates with the release of Galaxy A16, Galaxy A26, A36, A56, and the Galaxy A07.
Additionally, they provided 4 years of OS and security updates only for the following devices: the Galaxy A06 5G, and its rebranded versions, Galaxy F06 5G (sold in India), Galaxy M06 5G (sold online in select countries), and the Galaxy A25 (Japan variant).
Galaxy Book devices are subject to the Windows support life cycle. Samsung has no control on restricting Windows feature updates and Microsoft does not restrict feature updates on computers.
