The religious affiliation in the United States Senate reflects the variety of religion in the United States, despite not being in line with the religious affiliation of the general population.
While the religious preference of elected officials is by no means an indication of their allegiance nor necessarily reflective of their voting record, the religious affiliation of prominent members of all three branches of government is a source of commentary and discussion among the media and public. The topic is also of interest to religious groups and the general public who may appeal to senators of their denomination on religious or moral issues facing the United States Senate.
This list reports the religious affiliation of the members of the United States Senate in the 119th United States Congress. In most cases, in addition to specific sources, the senators' religious affiliations are those mentioned by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life at the Pew Research Center, which publishes a report at the beginning of each Congress.

In conjunction with figures derived from the Pew Research Center's 2021 "survey of the religious composition of the United States", the most basic breakdown of the above data indicates that 84% of the Senate identify as Christian (compared with 62% of the population), 9% identify as Jewish (compared with 2% of the population), 4% have unknown religious affiliation or refused to specify it (compared with 2% of the population), 1% identifies with other religions (compared with 5% of the population), while 0% identifies as unaffiliated (compared with 28% of the population). 
According to figures derived from the Gallup Inc., in 2023 the most basic breakdown of the above data indicates that 86% of the Senate identify as Christian (compared with 67% of the population), 9% identify as Jewish (compared with 2% of the population), 4% have unknown religious affiliation or refused to specify it (compared with 3% of the population), 1% identifies with other religions (compared with 6% of the population), while 0% identifies as unaffiliated (compared with 22% of the population).
The unaffiliated are extremely under-represented, while Jews, Presbyterians, Lutherans and Episcopalians are particularly over-represented.
