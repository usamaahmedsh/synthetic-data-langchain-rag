The United States Virgin Islands national soccer team (officially recognized as US Virgin Islands by FIFA), nicknamed The Dashing Eagles, is the national soccer team of the United States Virgin Islands and is controlled by the U.S. Virgin Islands Soccer Federation.


== History ==
Though FIFA did not officially recognize the USVI team as affiliated until 1992, the Virgin Islands federation was founded in the 1970s by Trinidad native Robert T. Wills who helped build the base of the USVI Soccer Federation as it is known today. The team played its first official international match on March 21, 1998, in a victory against the British Virgin Islands. In May 2011, the USVI soccer federation chief, Frederick Hillaren, began ambitious changes in the team and appointed Keith Griffith, former coach and captain of the Barbados national team and former coach of Trinidad and Tobago powerhouse club team Joe Public, as technical director. Within two months of Griffith's appointment, the team shot up 51 places in the FIFA World Rankings. Soccer is the third most popular sport on the islands.


=== FIFA Series ===
In November 2025, FIFA announced that U.S. Virgin Islands will participated in the 2026 FIFA Series held in Bayamón alongside Guam, American Samoa and host Puerto Rico


== Stadium ==
Previously the team did not have a national stadium and were forced to play their home matches at Lionel Roberts Park, a baseball stadium in Charlotte Amalie. For their 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification matches, the team needed to bring in a new grass surface and make other special arrangements. In the past, the team has played at Paul E. Joseph Stadium in St. Croix. However, in February 2012, it was announced that the stadium was condemned and will be demolished to make way for a new sports complex that will cost at least $50 million. The 50-acre (20 ha) complex will contain venues for tennis, volleyball, baseball, and aquatics. However, the plans did not include a new soccer stadium.
For the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, the team played at the Addelita Cancryn Junior High School Ground where they suffered a 4–0 loss to the Barbados national team.
In August 2019, the USVI Soccer Association officially opened the 1,200-seat Bethlehem Soccer Stadium in Christiansted after an almost four-year construction process of the new complex.
