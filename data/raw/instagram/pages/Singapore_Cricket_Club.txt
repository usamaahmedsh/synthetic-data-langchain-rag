The Singapore Cricket Club (SCC) is one of the premier sports and social clubs in Singapore. 
Its clubhouse is located on Connaught Drive on the south end of the Padang in Singapore's central business district.


== History ==
The SCC was established in 1852. Over the years, the club has had three clubhouse buildings on the Padang. The first was erected in the 1860s and the second in 1877. The third, which forms the core of the present-day clubhouse, was built in 1884.
As the second oldest club in Singapore, the SCC today has over 3,000 members. Cricket, rugby, football and field hockey are played on the Padang, and the club also has facilities for squash, tennis, lawn bowls, billiards and snooker.
The club has played host to many international cricket events over the years. It also hosts the annual Singapore Cricket Club International Rugby Sevens tournament and an annual Soccer Sevens competition.
They also have a football team participating in the National Football League and the second team participating in  Equatorial Football League Premiership.
The club also has a bar called the Men's Bar. In 2024, the club's general committee tabled a resolution to rename it "1852-The Heritage Bar". However, this decision was reversed the following year. Another resolution in 2025 for the bar's name to be "immediately replaced with a new and neutral name to be chosen by members", with "1852" and "Captain's Bar" offered as suggestions, was unsuccessful.
