Apple Wallet (or simply Wallet, known as Passbook prior to iOS 9) is a digital wallet developed by Apple Inc. and included with iOS and watchOS that allows users to store Wallet passes such as coupons, boarding passes, student ID cards, government ID cards, business credentials, resort passes, car keys, home keys, event tickets, public transportation passes, store cards, and – starting with iOS 8.1 – credit cards, and debit cards for use via Apple Pay.


== History ==
Apple Passbook was announced at the 2012 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June 11, 2012, and released with iOS 6 on September 19, 2012. It was renamed "Apple Wallet" with the release of iOS 9 on September 16, 2015.


== Features ==
Wallet displays Aztec, PDF417, and QR 2D barcodes and Code 128 1D barcodes beginning with iOS 9. Each digital coupon or ticket is known as a "pass". When the user launches Wallet for the first time, a brief introduction screen appears with a button inviting users to browse apps on the App Store with Wallet integration. Passes can also be distributed online via Safari, sent to the user via email, or scanned using the built-in scanner in Wallet.
Passes are synced between iOS devices using iCloud, and OS X 10.8.2 and later also support opening passes to be sent to users' iOS devices. Although the app is available in iOS 6 or later, it is only available on iPhone and iPod Touch, but not on iPad.
Since iOS 16, Wallet has also included the ability to track package deliveries for Apple Pay purchases from selected retailers, providing order details and shipping estimations as well as notifications for order arrivals or updates.
Wallet has the following features:

Displays 2D barcodes of following types: Aztec, PDF417 and QR.
Displays 1D barcodes of following types: Code 128 beginning with iOS 9.
Triggered by location. Up to 10 locations can be added to each Pass. A location is programmed as GPS coordinates (longitude, latitude, and altitude) and/or iBeacon UUID. (The UUID is a Universally Unique Identifier which is a 32 ASCII character code or a code automatically generated from a name using the PassKit API.)
Triggered by time of pass.
Localization of the pass. Up to 35 languages can be stored for each pass in Wallet.
Pass changes can be pushed via the Apple Push Notification service by the pass provider, or manually updated by the user themselves.
Mobile IDs that operate over ISO 18013-5 can be read & logged via third party apps in iOS 17.
Recurring payments with Apple Cash in iOS 17.


=== Express Mode & Power reserve ===
The first form of Express Mode came under the name "Express Transit" in iOS 12.3. Since then, supported payment cards, as well as some stored-value transport cards (such as Octopus or Suica) could be used to pay for journeys on certain public transport networks without requiring the user to authenticate the payment with Touch ID or Face ID, or even needing to wake the device. Once a supported payment or transit card is selected as a user's Express Transit card, one can simply hold their device near the card reader to authorize payment for the journey.
Since the initial functionality launched, Express Mode has expanded along with the number of card schemes Wallet supports. As of 2023, home keys, transit cards, access badges, campus IDs, hotel keys, and car keys are supported types of cards that can be used with Express Mode. However, Apple limits some passes if they are the same type or from the same issuer from being used with Express Mode. For example, a user can only have one campus ID and one car key each set to Express Mode. This can be mitigated in a sense by using an Apple Watch to split the Express Mode passes between multiple devices. Some cards support grouping to help ease the space that could be taken in the device's secure element. For instance, if a user has multiple home keys linked to Apple Home or multiple hotel rooms at a supported resort, all locks will be valid with a singular pass.
On iPhone XR, iPhone XS, or iPhone SE (2nd generation) and later, Express Mode cards can be used up to five hours via power reserve after the device has powered off due to a drained battery. A low-battery icon will display with "Express Cards Available" text appearing at the bottom of the display, letting users know that Express Mode-enabled cards are still available for usage. Payment cards are only available via power reserve when used for transit transactions. Power reserve functionality is not available for any Apple Watch model as of 2023.


== Ecosystem ==

Passes exist in a larger ecosystem, because  passes are created as a package. The package is a pass template, that is created with a pass signer, along with relevant data and a private key. Passes can be updated at any time using the PassKit API and an iOS app can interact directly with passes stored in Wallet.
Passes are presented and managed by Wallet. Systems and apps interact with passes via the PassKit API.

In its simplest form, an interaction (or transaction) between a pass and a system is facilitated by a 2D barcode or the modern QR code although it requires the customer to initiate the activity.
In late 2014, the first known implementations utilizing the iBeacon wireless Geo-fence started to appear in retail locations in the US. The iBeacon solutions allowed the retailer to broadcast an unsolicited lock-screen notice onto smartphones within Bluetooth range.
In 2015, Apple incorporated the ability to present a loyalty card in Wallet to a Payment terminal via NFC. Walgreens enabled this first with their Balance Rewards loyalty program; customers can add their card to Wallet through the Walgreens or Duane Reade mobile apps and tap their device to the terminal when prompted for their rewards card.
In 2016, Apple released the iPhone 7, along with Apple Pay support in Japan. This included IC e-cards like Suica to also be added digitally onto Apple Wallet. These cards work like a normal IC card, just on the iPhone, and Apple Wallet users can make normal transactions with their IC card using their iPhone, using the FeliCa NFC contactless technology to operate. Apple Wallet users can also reload their IC card just from their device using a debit or credit card added to Apple Wallet. To get a Suica, you could buy one digitally from Apple Wallet, or get a physical one from a JR East station and transfer the card balance to an iPhone. Japan's second main IC card, PASMO, would also be released later in 2020 with support with Apple Wallet.

In 2018, support was added for contactless Campus card for select universities. Such credentials operate in a similar manner to physical RFID cards in that they can be tapped to supported readers. The power reserve feature on select iPhones and Apple Watches allows for continued use of the card even when the battery is depleted as long as Express Mode is enabled.
In 2020, car keys were made available for the Apple Wallet, beginning with supported BMW vehicles. Such keys can be shared with friends and family, and permissions can be set per member, such as how fast they can go and whether or not some vehicle-specific features can be enabled/disabled or not. Such passes can also operate over UWB in addition to NFC.
In 2021, Apple announced the ability to store government-issued ID cards, resort passes, home keys, and business credentials in Wallet. As of September 2025, eleven U.S. States offer the ability to store a driver's license or state ID within the wallet app. Apple Wallet added support for the Japanese My Number Card in June 2025.
In 2022, Apple announced a new feature to track your Apple Pay orders in Wallet.


== Financial services ==


=== Apple Account ===

Apple Account is a stored value gift card that is issued and managed within Wallet. Users can add balances from iTunes and Apple gift cards for use in physical Apple Stores via Apple Pay or online across Apple's various services and online shop. Available only in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Japan.


=== Apple Card ===

Apple Card is an Apple-branded credit card that is issued and managed within Wallet. The service is provided by Goldman Sachs in association with Apple. Users can receive "Daily Cash" when shopping at certain retailers. A digital card is available to be added to Apple Pay for wherever Mastercard cards are accepted online or in-store. A physical card is also available, though it notably lacks an NFC antenna. Available only in the United States.


==== Savings Account ====
Goldman Sachs also offers a savings account to Apple Card holders, with a maximum annual percentage yield of 4.15%. A savings account is not required to utilize Apple Card.


=== Apple Cash ===
Apple Cash is a P2P payment service within Wallet. The service is provided by Green Dot Bank in association with Apple. Users can send and receive funds with others through the Wallet or Messages apps on iOS, watchOS, iPadOS, or macOS, or via tapping another user's iPhone or Apple Watch. A digital card is available to be added to Apple Pay for wherever Visa cards are accepted online or in-store. At launch, this service operated over the Discover Debit network, but has since switched to Visa Debit. Available only in the United States.


=== Apple Pay ===
Apple Pay is a service within Wallet that allows for payments with select banks and card networks. Currently available in 97 countries.


=== FinanceKit ===
FinanceKit is an API that allows third party iOS & iPadOS apps to display data from Apple Card, Apple Cash, Savings, and Orders stored in Wallet. Available only to apps that are listed in the American or British App Store.


== Availability ==
The Apple Wallet app is preinstalled on most iPhone and Apple Watch models worldwide, and developers from any country where Apple Developer resources are available can develop passes for Wallet. This is different from Apple Pay, which resides within Wallet, which currently has limited availability to a smaller selection of nations.


=== Region locking ===
These features in Wallet are locked behind a specific region setting of an iOS/watchOS device.


=== Supported loyalty programs ===
These programs are conveyed through NFC via Apple Wallet's VAS protocol. Programs that support One Tap are conveyed at the same time as a payment card stored in Apple Wallet. Conversely, Two Tap programs are redeemed in a sequential manner, where a loyalty pass is scanned first, and then the payment can be presented.


=== Supported public transport systems ===
For public transport systems where payment cards can be used & Express Mode is supported, passengers can travel with Apple Pay without authenticating each transaction. Transit cards that support direct provisioning can be issued within the Apple Wallet app itself, without needing to download a separate third-party application. Express Transit/Travel mode is available in the following places:

In addition to the above scenarios, Apple Pay can still be used with other non-Express Transit/Travel readers that accept contactless open loop payment cards, but they will have to be verified beforehand.


==== Partially Supported ====


==== Upcoming ====


=== Supported government-issued identifications ===

These territories permit their residents to save their government-issued identification credentials in Apple Wallet. In regards to American IDs, unlike the equivalent physical credentials, mobile government IDs in Apple Wallet can only be presented using NFC, so no barcode is scanned when presenting. Mobile IDs in Apple Wallet operate over the ISO 18013-5 or ISO 23220 mobile personal identification standards. Once the credential is read, the ID holder must confirm the personal information they wish to share (full name, age, etc.) The transmission to the reader device will be completed over BLE after the presentation is fully verified. Added credentials can also be requested by apps to present virtually. Available for iPhone 8 or later, and Apple Watch Series 4 or later. All IDs are free of cost except those of North Dakota, which costs $5 per ID renewal.
For Japanese IDs to be added, the Mynaportal app must be installed for provisioning to Wallet. Integration with Wallet for watchOS is not supported currently. Available for iPhone XR/XS/SE (2nd generation) or later, with iOS 18.5 or later.


==== Partially Supported ====


==== Upcoming ====


==== Other non-government issued identifications ====
These are digital IDs issued by Apple that utilize information from an individual's government-issued ID, but the digitized pass itself is not considered to be "government-issued."


=== Supported digital keys ===

These home locks, vehicle models, hotel rooms, and more can be unlocked via NFC with the iPhone XR, iPhone XS or later, and Apple Watch Series 5 or later. In addition, certain car models that support operation via UWB (AKA "passive entry") require an UWB compatible device (such as the iPhone 11 or later or the Apple Watch Series 6 or later) for enhanced functionality.
