Tasker is an application for Android which enables performing user-defined actions based on contexts (application, time, date, location, event, state) in user-defined profiles, activated by click- or timer-based home screen widgets. It was originally developed by a developer known as "Pent", and later purchased by João Dias. It is expandable from third-party apps through the "Tasker/Locale" plugin interface, which was originally developed for the discontinued Locale automation app.


== History ==
Tasker was inspired by Apt, a macro application developed by GlassWave in 2007 for devices running Palm OS. It is also created for the Android Developer Challenge 2, where the app came 3rd in the Productivity/Tools category. The app was released to the public in June 2010.
In November 2015, Tasker was removed from the Google Play Store for violating the Developer Program Policy regarding Dangerous Products for system interference. The issue appeared related to Doze and App Standby features, which were offered instead of a blanket permission to ignore battery optimizations. Google allows chat/voice apps to use the permission in Android to ignore the new battery optimization, features introduced with Doze Mode in Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The app was back in the Google Play Store as a "paid app" in 2016.


== TaskerNet ==
As of Tasker v5.5, tasks, profiles, and projects can be uploaded to TaskerNet and shared. The system, which is hosted on Tasker servers, acts as a file sharing system for Tasker files.
