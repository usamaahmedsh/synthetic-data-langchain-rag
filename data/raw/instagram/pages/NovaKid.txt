NovaKid is an online English-language education platform based in San Francisco, California.


== History ==
NovaKid was founded in 2017 by Maxim Azarov and Dmitry Malin as a platform that uses gamification and virtual reality to engage young learners.
In 2018, NovaKid expanded internationally, becoming available in Turkey and Poland; by 2020, it had expanded to Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, NovaKid saw user growth on its platform and raised $1.5 million in seed financing, followed by $4.25 million in Series A funding. A year later, in 2021, it raised $35 million in Series B funding.
In 2023, NovaKid reportedly became profitable. The following year, it acquired Lingumi, a UK-based app for preschool English learners, and established NovaKid Junior, a division focused on AI-guided learning for children.
