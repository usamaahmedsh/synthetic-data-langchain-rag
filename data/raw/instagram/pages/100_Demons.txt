100 Demons are an American metalcore band from Waterbury, Connecticut. Being fans of tattoos, the band derived their name from a book of traditional Japanese tattoo artwork by Horiyoshi III. The band usually incorporates their agnostic beliefs into their lyrics.
After over a decade of playing in the Connecticut hardcore scene, Deathwish Inc. announced the signing of 100 Demons to a record contract in 2003. In a press release, the label was quoted as saying "Today's 100 DEMONS encapsulate a viciousness and ravenous intensity that few could achieve." The band then found themselves at Planet Z Studios with producer Zeuss recording their self-titled album.
The video for the song "Repeat Process" was featured on Headbangers Ball.
In 2019, Pete Morcey announced his new folk-influenced side project entitled Murmur.
On August 20, 2024, Pete Morcey announced on Instagram that bassist Erik Barrett had died at the age of 48.
