The video took off almost immediately, and the sudden fame startled her. Her subsequent videos on TikTok and Instagram focused on sharing funny moments from her everyday life.

In early 2024, Myers removed all content from her TikTok account, while remaining active on other platforms. She has spoken openly about her infant son's open heart surgery and her depression, with some fellow TikTokers suggesting she may have taken a break from social media due to an organized campaign pressuring her to show solidarity with Palestine amidst a personal family crisis.
