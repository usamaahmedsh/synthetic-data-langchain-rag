Charles III has received numerous titles, decorations, and honorary appointments, as a member of the British royal family, as heir apparent to Elizabeth II, and as King of the United Kingdom and the 14 other Commonwealth realms.


== Royal and noble titles and styles ==
Charles was originally styled as "His Royal Highness Prince Charles of Edinburgh" per letters patent issued by his grandfather George VI.
Upon the accession of his mother as queen, as the eldest son of the monarch, Charles automatically became, in England, the Duke of Cornwall and, in Scotland, the Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. As such, he was styled "His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall", except in Scotland, where he was known as "His Royal Highness The Duke of Rothesay" instead.
In 1958, letters patent from the then sovereign made Charles the Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester and, on 1 July 1969, he was invested as such during a ceremony in which a coronet and robes were placed on him. In 2021, upon the death of his father, Prince Philip, Charles furthermore inherited the titles Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich. When he became the British sovereign himself on 8 September 2022, these titles merged with the Crown.


=== Regnal name ===
In an announcement following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Liz Truss referred to Charles as King Charles III, the first official usage of that name. Shortly afterwards Clarence House confirmed that he would use the regnal name Charles III.
There had previously been speculation that he might choose a different name, because the previous two monarchs named Charles are both associated with negative events in royal history: Charles I was beheaded in 1649 and Charles II reigned during the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London. The name Charles III is also associated with the Jacobite pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, who claimed the throne under that name in the 18th century. The most discussed alternative regnal name had been George VII, in honour of Charles' maternal grandfather; although, prior to succeeding to the throne, Charles denied discussing a regnal name at all.


=== Regnal style ===
Each Commonwealth realm acts as an independent monarchy but in a personal union, as such King Charles has different titles in each realm:

The King's full British styles and titles were read out at the state funeral of his mother by David White, Garter Principal King of Arms, as follows:
Let us humbly beseech Almighty God to bless with long life, health and honour, and all worldly happiness the Most High, Most Mighty and Most Excellent Monarch, our Sovereign Lord, Charles III, now, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of His other Realms and Territories King, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith, and Sovereign of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.
In conversation, the correct etiquette is to address him initially as Your Majesty and thereafter as Sir.


=== Commonwealth ===
On 20 April 2018, the Commonwealth Heads of Government agreed that Charles would succeed his mother as Head of the Commonwealth, which he did on her death on 8 September 2022.
