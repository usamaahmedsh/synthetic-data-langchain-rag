== History ==


=== Formation and Translating the Name (2003–2004) ===
Saosin was originally started by Beau Burchell after leaving his old band Open Hand, he started writing demos using early DAW software, Burchell over time had composed 6 to 7 song demos by himself that would eventually become the songs featured on Translating The Name, Burchell initially did the vocals himself but got David Richardson to do vocals on the "lost symphonies" demo and told Burchell he knew Anthony Green who he thought would be a better fit for the band, Richardson also recommended Justin Shekoski the old guitar player of his band As Hope Dies, Shekoski agreed to join the band and after listening to his past material and contacting Green accepted the job and ended up flying from his home to California to play with them, Burchell then contacted Kennedy and Rodriguez, who he met and played with previously in Open Hand however Rodriguez couldnt join the band at the time due to tour obligations, The original lineup of Saosin, comprising Burchell, Shekoski, Kennedy, and Green, came together during the summer of 2003. Green lived with Kennedy and his parents until he left the band.  The band's name was initially proposed by Green. According to AllMusic, the name comes from the Chinese translation of "be careful" (xiǎoxīn). The phrase translates literally to "small heart". On June 18, 2023, during their 20th-anniversary show in Garden Grove, California, Chris revealed that Beau had initially proposed naming the band "The Gift". On June 17, the band unveiled their debut commercial production, the EP titled Translating the Name. This release met immediate success and gained significant popularity on various online forums and music websites.
Saosin initially gained recognition through the power of the internet, cultivating a distinctive musical identity even before the release of their first full-length studio album. They became well-known on social networking platforms and music-sharing sites, most notably MySpace. It's estimated that the EP sold approximately 62,000 copies.
After the recording of the Translating the Name EP, bassist Zach Kennedy later opted to depart the band after their first show to pursue a career in art, leading to his replacement by Chris Sorenson. Additionally, Pat Magrath, who had previously served as a drum technician for Slayer, was hired to record drums for the EP. The drum compositions were largely crafted by Burchell. Alex Rodriguez, initially unable to participate in the EP recording due to prior commitments with the band Open Hand, was temporarily substituted by Danny King for live performances until Rodriguez could transition to a full-time role in Saosin after fulfilling his obligations with Open Hand. Following the release of "Translating the Name", Saosin embarked on a U.S. tour alongside fellow bands Boys Night Out and Anatomy of a Ghost.
In February 2004, the band faced a significant change when their vocalist, Anthony Green, departed from Saosin and later went on to form the band Circa Survive. Green, a native of Pennsylvania, cited homesickness, depression, and his desire to be closer to his family as factors contributing to his departure. He also expressed discontent with Saosin's creative direction and his exclusion from the songwriting process. To fulfill their remaining obligations for the Warped Tour, Story of the Year's Philip Sneed temporarily took over vocal duties. Subsequently, a public, nationwide audition was conducted to find a replacement for Green.
Translating the Name was recognized for pushing the boundaries of the post-hardcore genre and reshaping the music landscape. Alternative Press noted that with the release of this EP, Saosin made waves in the underground music scene, attracting considerable attention from record labels.


=== Introduction of Cove Reber and the Saosin EP (2004–2006) ===
After an exhaustive audition process and a brief period of using guest vocalists for demos, the band introduced a new lead singer, 19-year-old Cove Reber. Reber came into the fold after submitting an acoustic demo tape titled "Mookie's Last Christmas".
In an interview with Euphonia Online, Reber expressed his admiration for his new bandmates, saying, "Everyone I've played with wants to make music their lives. ... Saosin is a band on a completely different level. All these dudes are freaks about music."
Saosin embarked on their inaugural Taste of Chaos tour that winter, sharing stages with notable bands such as the Used, My Chemical Romance, Killswitch Engage, Senses Fail, and A Static Lullaby. In March, the band signed with Capitol Records and participated in the United States' Warped Tour once again. During that summer, they released the Saosin EP. Originally intended as a free sampler, Capitol Records opted to release it as an EP instead. The EP featured demo versions of songs that would later appear on their debut full-length album. A music video for their new single, "Bury Your Head", was filmed during this tour. Throughout 2005, the band continued to tour extensively, opening for acts such as Avenged Sevenfold and Coheed and Cambria.

After a respite from touring between February and June, the Warped Tour 2006 and numerous demos and compilation appearances, Saosin released their first full-length album Saosin on September 26, 2006.

The guitar riffs on the album were listed on Alternative Press's "Best Guitar Riffs of 2000s Rock". The first single, "Voices" was listed on the Top 46 post-hardcore songs of the 2000s, and the second single "You're Not Alone" was listed on the Top 10 Essential Emo Power Ballads by the Alternative Press.
During the rest of 2006, Saosin toured on the International Taste of Chaos Tour, playing their first shows outside of America.

Between April and June they toured in Europe, Australia, Japan and Indonesia.

When Saosin returned home they continued their headlining tour with Poison the Well, the Receiving End of Sirens, Fiore and Flight 409. In the later summer of 2007, they were part of Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution tour. After this, they headlined another tour in the US and Canada with Alexisonfire, Envy on the Coast, Norma Jean and the Dear and Departed. Concert footage was recorded during the tour stop on November 3, 2007, at The Theater of Living Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which was later compiled for a live album and concert film entitled Come Close.

=== The departure of Reber and period of inactivity (2010–2014) ===
On July 21, 2010, guitarist Beau Burchell delivered significant news to Saosin's fans, revealing that the band had decided to part ways with lead singer Cove Reber. This decision was prompted by concerns over Reber's declining stage performance and vocal abilities. In Burchell's words, "We didn't feel he could represent the music that we have recorded well on stage." Following his departure from Saosin, Reber became the lead vocalist for such bands as Patriot, Dead American and lé tired.
Amidst the uncertainty about Saosin's future, guitarist Beau Burchell shared updates on the band's progress in the studio, expressing enthusiasm for their forthcoming record. The departure of Reber left questions about the band's vocal direction and the search for his replacement. Reports surfaced that Charles Furney, lead singer of Secret and Whisper, might fill the vacant vocalist position. However, Saosin quickly denied these claims on their Facebook page, asserting that they had not yet found a new singer.
There were speculations that Tides of Man vocalist, Tilian Pearson, would audition for Saosin's vacant position. Pearson confirmed these rumors and acknowledged his interest in joining Saosin, which ultimately led to his departure from Tides of Man. However, Justin Shekoski clarified that although Pearson expressed a strong desire to join Saosin, the band had not met him in person yet.
During this period, a leaked demo fueled speculation about Pearson's involvement with Saosin. In an interview, Pearson clarified that the leaked demo was for a track that Saosin's bassist, Chris Sorenson, had been working on, and Pearson had provided vocals for it.
On December 16, 2012, Anthony Green joined Burchell and Shekoski on stage for the first time in nearly a decade, performing "Seven Years". In a later interview with Alternative Press, Green expressed openness to the idea of rejoining Saosin if the timing and circumstances were right while reflecting on the band's ten-year anniversary of the Translating the Name EP. On January 25, 2014, Beau Burchell provided further hints of Saosin's activities by tweeting a photo from Hurley Studios, indicating that he was tracking drums with Alex Rodriguez.

During these shows, they unveiled two new songs and announced their progress in creating a new full-length album. During an interview with Alternative Press, the band hinted at the possibility of a future collaborations with Green.
In 2015, after 13 years of collaboration, Justin Shekoski and Saosin parted ways, with Shekoski subsequently becoming the lead guitarist for the Used. To fill the role of lead guitarist during the upcoming East Coast tour, Phil Sgrosso (former As I Lay Dying, Wovenwar) stepped in.
