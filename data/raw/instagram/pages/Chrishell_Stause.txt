== Early life ==
Stause was born on July 21, 1981 in Draffenville, Kentucky. She attended Murray State University, from which she received her B.A. in theater in 2003. Her middle name "Chrishell" is a portmanteau word created based on the unusual circumstances  of her birth: her mother went into labor at a Shell station, and  an attendant named Chris helped deliver the baby. However, in her book Stause denies the gossip on her birth. She mentioned that her mother had some car troubles and pulled into a gas station. While waiting at the car station, she went into pre-labor and the car attendant genuinely helped her to reach a hospital. Stause was born in a hospital. Before knowing that she was pregnant, her mother broke up with Chrishell's biological  father, who was half Japanese and half Spanish. Jeff was her stepfather. 
Stause missed a full year of middle school because she was forced to live in a tent. At that time, Stause mentioned washing her hair in the river, using food stamps and hiding her life from classmates. Her parents "struggled with addiction and mental health" and for a period joined the Worldwide Church of God when she was 10 years old. Her mother never had a steady job and Stause describes her as free spirit and self-righteous.
