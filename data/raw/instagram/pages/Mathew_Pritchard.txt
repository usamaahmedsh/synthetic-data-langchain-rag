Pritchard was also involved in multiple spin-off series. Dainton and Pritchard hosted MTV's 2007 stunt-based game show Wrecked, and Sanchez Get High was a spin-off in which Pritchard and Dainton visited indigenous peoples and took traditional medicines. It aired on MTV in 2008.
Pritchard appeared with Locke as the "Pain Men" in 10 episodes of the Channel 4 game show Balls of Steel, which ran from 2005 to 2008.
