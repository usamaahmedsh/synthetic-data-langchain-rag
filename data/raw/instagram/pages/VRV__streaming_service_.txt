VRV (officially pronounced "verve", though it is also referred to by its letters) was an American over-the-top streaming service launched in November 2016 by AT&T and the Chernin Group. The service bundled together anime, speculative fiction, educational, and gaming-related channels aimed at fans of such content. 
Some of VRV's content could be streamed for free, while other content required a subscription. The subscriptions to its channels were available for purchase individually, or in a premium bundle. VRV was available only in the United States, despite some of its partnered content being available for viewing worldwide outside the platform.
In April 2023, it was announced VRV would merge with Crunchyroll, which was completed later that month.
