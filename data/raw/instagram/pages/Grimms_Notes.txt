== Gameplay ==
Grimms Notes is a side-scrolling role-playing game. The player controls a party of characters based on fairy tales and stories such as Little Red Riding Hood and Cinderella. The player directly controls the main character, moving them around the battle screen and attacking enemies, while the game controls the other party members. As characters defeat enemies they charge a skill meter, with the player activating the character's unique skill, both for the main character and others, when fully charged.
The game features a "Soul System", wherein each character has two "souls" equipped, equivalent to jobs or character classes. In between battles the player can change which souls are equipped.


== Plot ==
In the game, the player and the fairy tale characters band together to combat "Chaos Tellers", which are rewriting the fairy tale stories and changing fate. Fairy tales include characters from such stories as Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, and Little Red Riding Hood.


== Release ==
The game was released in Japan on January 21, 2016 for Android and iOS devices. It was released worldwide on March 2, 2018 in South Korea, China, North America and Europe by Flero Games, a Korean publisher. On January 10, 2019 the global version was shut down. The Japanese version closed its services on June 17, 2020. It was planned to end service on April 30, 2020, but the date was delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic. Later, a free offline application was released, which made it available to read every cutscene ever released without the gameplay. It is now considered a visual novel.
