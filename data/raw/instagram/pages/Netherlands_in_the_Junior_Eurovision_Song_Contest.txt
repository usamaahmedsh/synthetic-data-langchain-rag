The Netherlands has been represented in every edition of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest since its inception in 2003 and is the only country to have taken part in every edition of the contest. The Dutch participating broadcaster in the contest is AVROTROS since 2014 (formerly AVRO from 2003 to 2013), and selects its entrant through the national final Junior Songfestival. They have won the competition on one occasion; in 2009, with the song "Click Clack" by Ralf Mackenbach. 


== History ==
The Netherlands are one of the sixteen countries to have made their debut at the inaugural Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2003, which took place on 15 November 2003 at the Forum in Copenhagen, Denmark.
The broadcaster AVROTROS, formerly AVRO, is responsible for the organisation of the Dutch Junior Eurovision Song Contest entry. A national final has been organised by AVRO to select the entry, called Junior Songfestival. Entrants previously wrote their own songs and sent it to the broadcaster, where a jury and the public decided the winner. Since 2016, candidates audition individually and are placed in groups later on.
As of 2025, the Netherlands has won the competition once – at the 2009 contest in Kyiv, Ukraine, Ralf Mackenbach won with the song "Click Clack" with 121 points, beating runners-up Russia and Armenia by just five points. This was the Netherlands' fifth victory at any Eurovision event, the last time being the Eurovision Song Contest 1975.
The 2007 contest was held in the Netherlands, in the venue Ahoy in Rotterdam. The 2012 contest was held in the Netherlands as well, this time in Amsterdam, making it the first country to host the Junior Eurovision Song Contest twice.
