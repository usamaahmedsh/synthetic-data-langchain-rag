Hello Neighbor is a stealth horror game developed by Dynamic Pixels and published by tinyBuild. Initially released as public alphas from 2016 to 2017, it received a full release for Windows and Xbox One on 8 December 2017, and later for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android on 26 July 2018.
The players controls Nicky Roth, who witnesses strange happenings at the house of his next-door neighbor, Theodore Peterson. His goal is to successfully sneak into the basement of the house to uncover a dark secret while avoiding being caught by Theodore. One of the main selling points of the game was the neighbor's artificial intelligence (AI) that changed behavior based on the player's past actions, such as setting bear traps along the player's path in a previous attempt, putting water bucket traps above doors the player has used, and setting up surveillance cameras in areas the player has consistently visited.
While the initial alpha versions of Hello Neighbor were received positively, the final product was met with largely negative reviews. The game-play, puzzles, control scheme, and technical performance have been heavily criticized; but the story elements and characters, were praised. The game spawned a franchise, beginning with a prequel, Hello Neighbor: Hide and Seek, released in December 2018. Two multiplayer spin-offs, Secret Neighbor and Hello Engineer, were released in October 2019 and October 2021, respectively. A standalone sequel, Hello Neighbor 2, was released on 6 December 2022.


== Game-play ==
In Hello Neighbor, the player character has moved into an old house across the street from a mysterious neighbor who is behaving abnormally and seems to be keeping a secret in his basement. The player's task is to find the details and brutal secrets of the neighbor's house and solve a series of puzzles to collect the item(s) needed to unlock and access his basement. As the player explores the neighbor's house, they must not be spotted by the mysterious neighbor, or they will be chased down, and if the player is not quick enough to hide or escape, they will be captured and be sent back out onto the street. The player can stun the neighbor by throwing objects at him for an easier escape. If the player is caught or suffers a serious injury, they will be sent back to their own house and will have to break in again. Upon starting again, the player must be more careful, as the neighbor will deduce movements from the last attempt and set up traps. The player can use the game settings to turn on "friendly" neighbor mode, preventing the neighbor from setting these traps and causing him to be less aggressive in his pursuits. However, he is still to be avoided at all costs.
The game is divided into four acts: Act 1 to 3, and Act Finale. The game is played in a first-person perspective, and the player must aim a reticle at certain objects to interact with them or to throw or use a held item (for example, throwing a ball at a window or aiming a crowbar at nails to remove them). Up to four items can be kept in an inventory space. Items of the same kind cannot be stacked together in one slot. The controls are, of course, different on different platforms.


== Plot ==

In 1996, a boy named Nicky Roth is chasing a beach ball, playing football down the street of Raven Brooks before stopping by his neighbor, Theodore Peterson's home. He hears screaming and approaches Theodore's window, witnessing him stuffing what is presumably a child inside his basement only to get caught and thrown back at his house on the other side of the street. From here, Nicky must access Theodore's basement, using a red key, which is located on the second floor of Theodore’s house. Upon doing so, Nicky enters Theodore's complex basement and descends further into the maze, before reaching a door locked with locks of all colors while being pursued by Theodore. The Act ends with Nicky being captured by Theodore, and locked inside a desolate room with windows displaying fake pictures of the outdoors, ending Act 1.
Some time after the events of Act 1, Nicky manages to escape his cell with the help of Theodore's son, Aaron, and escape the basement, only to find that Mr. Peterson has erected a massive fence around his property to prevent anyone from entering or escaping. Nicky is forced to solve several puzzles to find a way to escape Mr. Peterson's property. Once he crosses the fence, he flees back to his home, and Mr. Peterson, hearing a loud smash implied to be caused by his son Aaron, does not give chase, instead staring Nicky dead in the eyes, before locking back up his house, ending Act 2.
In 2015, an adult Nicky is evicted from his apartment and he decides to return to his old family home. Raven Brooks had finally succumbed to its cruel fate, and he finds his house in disrepair while Mr. Peterson's home is nothing but a pile of ruins. While inspecting the ruins, Nicky is haunted by a dark shadow-like creature ("The Thing"), which is implied to be a manifestation of fear itself, and he returns to his home where he finds an old picture of himself as a child before the phone starts to ring. After answering the phone, Nicky sees The Thing again. Believing he is hallucinating, he goes to sleep as an act of self-therapy. He is awoken by a child's scream and discovers Mr. Peterson's house is back and more surreal than before, due to his trauma. Nicky navigates the house and has surreal experiences, such as learning to double jump by overcoming his fear of the dark, or overcoming his school fears. Eventually, he enters the basement, now older and more surreal like the house, with exaggerated architecture and with a run-in by The Thing. At the end of the basement is a parallel to Act 1, with Mr. Peterson attempting to chase Nicky through the basement.
Entering the room at the end of the basement, Nicky is face-to-face with a cardboard representation of Aaron and a giant version of Mr. Peterson himself. Nicky's task in this Act is to knock him to his knees and get into the giant house on his back. After doing so, he must protect a younger version of himself from The Thing. Each time The Thing attacks and Nicky protects his younger self, Nicky grows larger until he can fight The Thing. After The Thing is defeated, Nicky sees Mr. Peterson in a small two-room house.
When he spots Nicky he runs in desperation towards the window as if to ask for help, but then sighs and sadly turns away. In the other room is a much smaller version of The Thing. Mr. Peterson has boarded the door up on his side and placed a chair against it, signifying that while Nicky faced his fears and overcame them, Mr. Peterson never overcame his fear, instead choosing to lock it away. Unable to help him, Nicky leaves through an exit door and wakes up from his dream before going outside to unload his car and bring his stuff into his house.
