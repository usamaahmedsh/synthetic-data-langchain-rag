Zor-El is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. A Kryptonian, he is the younger brother of Jor-El, husband of Alura, father of Supergirl, and paternal uncle of Superman.
Traditional depictions of Zor-El in Golden Age and Silver Age DC Comics stories portrayed him as a benevolent scientist concerned for his daughter Kara, acting similarly to his older brother Jor-El in sending his child to safety on Earth. In the mid-2000s, DC experimented with different characterisations of Zor-El, even briefly casting him as a mad scientist with a grudge against his brother. A similar depiction was used when the character was adapted for television in the series Smallville. In 2010s stories following DC's The New 52 reboot, Zor-El has been an antagonist for Supergirl and Superman, having been transformed into the villain Cyborg Superman by Brainiac.
Zor-El was portrayed by Simon Ward in the film Supergirl, and will be played by David Krumholtz in the upcoming DC Universe film Supergirl (2026). Christopher Heyerdahl portrayed a villainous version in the TV series Smallville. Robert Gant portrayed the character in the Arrowverse television series Supergirl in the first two seasons, and Jason Behr portrayed him in the sixth season.

== Fictional character biography ==


=== Pre-Crisis ===
In pre-Crisis continuity, Zor-El was a climatographer on Krypton, and one of the only scientists to believe his brother Jor-El's predictions about the impending destruction of Krypton. When the planet exploded, Argo City was blown safely into space with a life-giving bubble of air around it (a later version of the story has the city saved by weather dome that Zor-El had constructed). The explosion turns the ground beneath Argo into kryptonite, but Zor-El and the other survivors covered the surface with sheets of lead. The Kryptonians manage to keep alive for many years, and Kara was born a short time after the destruction of Krypton. The end for Argo came when a meteor storm punched holes into the lead sheeting, exposing the survivors to kryptonite radiation. Zor-El managed to build a rocket and use it to send his daughter Kara to Earth.
It was later revealed to Supergirl that her parents had teleported away into the Survival Zone (similar to the Phantom Zone) during Argo's final moments. Supergirl was able to rescue them, and Zor-El and Alura went on to live in Kandor. When the bottle city was enlarged, Zor-El and Alura resettled on New Krypton/Rokyn.


==== Earth-Two ====
In the alternate universe of Earth-Two, Zor-L and Allura did not survive Krypton's destruction. Additionally, Zor-L lived in Kandor rather than Argo City.


=== Post-Crisis and Zero Hour (Birthright) and Infinite Crisis timelines ===

In "The Supergirl from Krypton" story-arc in Superman/Batman #8-13 (May–October 2004), Zor-El rocketed his daughter away from Krypton before Kal-El left. It was expected that she would reach Earth first and could help raise Kal from his infancy. However, she stayed in stasis and her ship did not reach Earth until years later, so the infant she expected to help raise was a grown man when she arrived still in her teens.
In the Supergirl series, new information on Zor-El's history and relations are crucial with Zor-El was featured in issue #16 as he appeared as an apparition and explained what truly happened to Kara, and why she was sent to Earth to kill Kal-El, in a dream sequence. Zor-El was against the use of the Phantom Zone as a prison because he felt that it would become abused, since no blood was shed, it became a clean way to deal with criminals. In the Argo City area he lived in, he was a very trusted scientist like his brother Jor-El. He fought with Jor-El over the use of the Phantom Zone and tried to stop him from supporting it.
In Action Comics #869 it is revealed the Zor-El saved Argo City from Krypton's destruction by engineering a protective dome with his wife Alura. However, Brainiac, who was the culprit for Krypton's explosion, returned to finish the job. He merged Argo with the city of Kandor and killed those he considered to be duplicate information. Superman finds the city in Brainiac's ship. Zor-El and Alura are able to make contact with Kal-El to enquire about their daughter. He was later murdered by Reactron.
In Blackest Night crossover, Zor-El is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps. The scientists of New Krypton manage to place a forcefield composed of a counter-energy to the black ring's power source around the planet, cutting off Zor-El's right hand and preventing him from continuing his attack.


=== The New 52 ===

In The New 52 continuity reboot, Zor-El was rescued from the destruction of Krypton by Brainiac, who converted him into a cyborg, removed his memories, and forced him into servitude. Zor-El battles Supergirl before regaining his memories, after which he is treated and his cybernetic implants removed. The Department of Extranormal Operations captures Zor-El after he attacks Indigo, leading Jor-El to kill him.
