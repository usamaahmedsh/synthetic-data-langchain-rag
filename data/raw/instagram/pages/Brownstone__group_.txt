Brownstone is an American female contemporary R&B group that was popular during the mid-1990s. They are best known for their 1994 hit single "If You Love Me", which was nominated for a Best R&B Performance Grammy Award. "Grapevyne", "5 Miles to Empty" and "Pass the Lovin'" also brought them some success, as well as their rendition of "I Can't Tell You Why", a song originally recorded by The Eagles.
In 2019, it was announced that Brownstone were to reunite with founding members Nicci Gilbert and Mimi Doby, alongside returning member Teisha Brown for the 25th anniversary of the Essence Festival in July, as well the 25th anniversary of the group.


== Career ==
The three original members of Brownstone were Monica "Mimi" Doby, Charmayne Maxena "Maxee" Maxwell and Nichole "Nicci" Gilbert. Founded in Los Angeles, the singers met each other after attending various auditions around the city. They formed the group and were signed to Michael Jackson's MJJ Music record label less than a year later. The group soon recorded its debut album From the Bottom Up, which spawned the hit singles "If You Love Me" and "Grapevyne." In 1995, the group earned a Grammy Award nomination and a Billboard Music Award. After extensive touring around the globe, Doby left the group for health reasons; in an interview with BET Video Soul host Donnie Simpson, the problem was cited as bronchitis. The cause of her split from the group was later said (in radio interviews) to be internal strife with the other two members. She was replaced by Kina Cosper of Detroit; other members over the years includes Kymberli Wright of Detroit, Racquel Roberts of Los Angeles and Teisha Brown of Detroit.
After a difficult transition period, Brownstone released the song "5 Miles to Empty" from their sophomore album Still Climbing. In 1998, Brownstone was featured on the soundtrack for the film The Players Club with the song "Don't Play Me Wrong".
Charmayne Maxena "Maxee" Maxwell died on February 27, 2015, at age 46 following what has been reported publicly as an accidental fall.
