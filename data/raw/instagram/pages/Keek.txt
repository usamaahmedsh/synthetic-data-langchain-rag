Keek is a free online social networking service that allowed its users to upload video status updates, which are called "keeks". Users can post keeks to the Keek website using a webcam or via the Keek mobile apps for iPhone, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, or Android. Users could also reply back with text or video comments, known as "keekbacks", and share content to other major social media networks. There was also an embed option so users could embed their keeks into a blog or website.


== Origins ==
The word "Keek" comes from Scots and means a look, especially a quick one. Keek Inc. is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and has around 45 employees. Keek launched in early 2011 to "create a social network that was more authentic and personal. We are committed to delivering the fastest, most engaging social video experience," CEO Isaac Raichyk said in an interview.


== Reception ==
Keek has been described as "the Twitter for video", "Instagram of video" and a "micro version of YouTube". and is often compared to a combination of other major social media networks such as Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr and Twitter. "Keek is more like a combination of YouTube, Facebook and Twitter than its direct competitors."
"What makes Keek different is that it focuses on short, personal video uploads. A 'keek' can only be 36 seconds long, and is usually uploaded directly from a webcam or smartphone camera. So unlike many of the professional vloggers floating around on YouTube, the content is less polished – but also far quicker and reactive. Think of it like Twitter or Tumblr, only this time focused solely on video."
Keek has been described as a "new wave in social media technology" in reaction to the growth it received in 2012.


== Growth ==
In 2012 the Keek community started generating a large amount of original content posting 66,000 videos per day. With the launch of the Keek mobile apps for iOS and Android in March 2012, there was a significant increase in the community and creation of content. Keek added 2 Million users in October 2012 and served 250 million pageviews.
By January 2013 Keek was adding 200,000 users per day to its social network and users were generating 4 million videos per month.
In March 2013, Keek announced the launch of verified accounts. Individuals or businesses can qualify for account verification if they are at high risk of impersonation or if they have large audiences on Keek or other social networks.
Also in March, Keek launched a BlackBerry version of their app allowing BlackBerry 10 users the ability to share videos on Keek, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Email or via SMS.
Between March 2013 and June 2013 Keek added 24 million users to bring its network to a total of 45 million registered users.
On May 17, 2013 Keek added a new private messaging feature, allowing users to privately chat using video or text with up to 36 people at once.
Keek launched a developer portal with API access on June 14, 2013. The new API program will allow developers to access public keeks, search functionality, user profiles, Klusters and more.
Keek launched a Windows phone version of their app on June 27, 2013.
In August 2013 Keek reached a total of 58 million users growing at the rate of 250,000 new users a day. Keek has been the top video app in 18 countries globally.
However, by October 2013 Keek was struggling to raise more venture capital funding through investment firm Morgan Stanley and was forced to downsize its operation to half a dozen staff members.
By November 2013 a reverse takeover bid was announced by oil company Primary Petroleum. The reverse takeover would see Primary Petroleum sell off all of its oil holdings and change its name to Keek Inc, effectively merging the two companies, and bringing Keek to the public stock market. During this time co-founder and CEO Isaac Raichyk left Keek to found a new mobile dating platform called Clover.
As of June 2014 Keek was set to expand its offices into New York City, and had changed its upper management to include Jamie King as CPO, Lin Dai as CMO, and Alexandra Cameron as the new CEO.
On October 31, 2016, Keek was rebranded as Peeks Video.
