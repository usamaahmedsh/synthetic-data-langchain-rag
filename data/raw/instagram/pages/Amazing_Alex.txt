Amazing Alex was a physics-based puzzle game created by Rovio Entertainment, developer of the popular video game Angry Birds. 
Amazing Alex was announced by Rovio's CEO, Mikael Hed, on Yle's breakfast television in May 2012. The game was based on Casey's Contraptions, a game created by Noel Llopis of Snappy Touch, and Miguel Ángel Friginal of Mystery Coconut, whose rights were acquired by Rovio. 
The game featured educational elements and revolved around the character Alex, described as a curious boy with an interest in building things. The goal was to create various Rube Goldberg-esque machines to get a ball to a certain location. The game held similarities to The Incredible Machine, originally released in 1993.
On April 13, 2015, the game was removed from the App Store and Google Play.


== Gameplay ==
The primary goal of the game was to strategically place household objects to guide a ball towards its goal. Once the objects had been placed, the player could initiate the timer, and the ball would start moving. The path and trajectory of the ball would be influenced by the placement of the objects. In addition to reaching the goal, players could collect up to three stars that were placed throughout the level. The game also included special modes such as "Levels of the Week," "Downloaded Levels," and "My Levels."


== Reception ==

Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer gave the game a Bronze Award, calling it an "addictive experience" but when "compared to Angry Birds, had less excitement involved."
