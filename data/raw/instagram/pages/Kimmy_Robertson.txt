== Career ==

Robertson's high-pitched voice has led to roles in animated series such as Batman: The Animated Series, The Critic, The Tick and The Simpsons. Her voice also featured in Beauty and the Beast in 1991. From 1993 to 1995, Robertson voiced Penny on 2 Stupid Dogs' Secret Squirrel segments. Robertson performed a short spoken-word segment on Roger McGuinn's 1990 album Back from Rio.

=== Support of Brian Peck ===
On April 3, 2024, former child star Drake Bell, best known for his work on The Amanda Show and Drake & Josh, criticized Robertson for writing a letter of support for Brian Peck, a Nickelodeon voice coach who was later convicted of sexually assaulting Bell when he was a teenager in 2001. The backlash resulted in Robertson deleting her Instagram. Robertson wrote the letter in 2004, after Peck had been charged with 11 counts of lewd sexual conduct, including sodomy and oral copulation by anesthesia or controlled substance, with a minor. In the letter, she called Bell an "overtly gay, oversexed person" and said she believed Bell, then 14 or 15, had pressured Peck, then 40 or 41, into a sexual relationship. The letter came to light shortly before the release of Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV.
