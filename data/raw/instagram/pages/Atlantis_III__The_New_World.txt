Its retail sales in the region for 2003 totaled 7,637 units. The combined global sales of Atlantis III and its predecessors, Atlantis and Atlantis II, surpassed 1 million units by 2004. According to review aggregation website Metacritic, the game received "generally favorable reviews" from critics.
Staci Krause of IGN positively compared the game to Schizm and Road to India, praising its storyline as being both well developed and engaging. Ron Dulin of GameSpot thought that the game lacked any sense of narrative cohesion, and instead focused on visually appealing environments and interesting puzzles. Absolute Games gave the game a rating of 60%.
Atlantis III was a nominee for GameSpot's 2001 "Best Adventure Game" award, which ultimately went to Myst III: Exile. The editors wrote: "Beyond Atlantis II is full of strange puzzles and metaphysical gobbledygook. But the constant barrage of strangeness actually works in the game's favor".
