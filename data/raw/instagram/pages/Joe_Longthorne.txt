Longthorne won a talent show when he was six; his prize was a toy motor car. At fourteen, he landed a part in Yorkshire Television's series Junior Showtime, and remained with the show for over two years. He later turned professional and earned a living in working men's clubs in Northern England.

Longthorne appeared on television in 1981, through the London Weekend Television series Search For a Star, on which he performed as a singer and impressionist.

In 1988, he presented his own television series, The Joe Longthorne Show.
Longthorne appeared regularly on several TV programmes in the 1980s, including The Les Dennis Laughter Show and The Royal Variety Performance. He performed in theatres in the United States and at the Sydney Opera House.

In 2023, a clip of Longthorne performing "Morning of My Life" was watched on a Twitch stream by Scottish comedian Limmy, who introduced a new generation of listeners to Longthorne in doing so. Longthorne's newfound posthumous cult following led to the creation of the Instagram account @morningofmylifedaily, which reposts clips of Longthorne hitting the high note in "Morning of My Life" in live performances every day.
