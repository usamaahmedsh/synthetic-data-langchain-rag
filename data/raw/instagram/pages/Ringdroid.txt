Ringdroid is an open source Ringtone creation utility application that runs on the Android Operating System. Ringdroid lets users record and edit audio files for use as ringtones, alarms or notifications.


== Features ==
Ringdroid has a graphical editor that displays the waveform similar to pro-audio software allowing users to select the portion of a song they want. Each audio section is highlighted with divider lines having handles for touch-dragging. There are also inputs for numerical values for the start and end points and controls to zoom in and out on the waveform. Users can save files as a ringtone, an alarm or a notification. Ringdroid does not have the ability to fade or loop.
Ringdroid supports MP3, WAV, OGG Vorbis, AAC, MP4, 3GPP, and AMR file formats.
