Whoscall is a mobile application that offers caller identification services developed by Gogolook Co., Ltd., a listed company in Taiwan.


== History ==
Originally a part-time project by Jeff Kuo, Jackie Chang, and Reiny Song, the trio co-founded Gogolook with the goal of developing a caller identification system to prevent fraud. In August 2010, the first version of Whoscall was released on Google Play in several countries and attracted voluntary downloads.
In April 2014, concerns regarding Whoscall's privacy issues rose to the forefront of national attention as public figures took to the press and expressed their concerns with public records including home telephone numbers and addresses showing up on incoming calling screens. Gogolook released a statement declaring that they had never collected nor stored any personal information on their servers, let alone made them publicly available. It was subsequently discovered that the personal information of the aforementioned public figures was leaked from government servers with poor security protocols that made the information available on search engines, from which Gogolook sources some of their information.
