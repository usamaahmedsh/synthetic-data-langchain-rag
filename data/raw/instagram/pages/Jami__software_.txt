Jami is a free and open-source telecommunications platform for peer-to-peer and distributed videotelephony, videoconferencing, and voice calls. It also has instant messaging, file transfer, support for calls to landline and mobile telephones (over traditional telephone networks), and other features.
Jami is free and open-source software released under the GNU GPL-3.0-or-later. Jami is developed by Savoir-faire Linux (SFL) and community contributors.
Jami is available for most desktop and mobile platforms. Internal builds of Jami for web browsers are yet to be publicly released.


== History ==
In December 2004, Savoir-faire Linux launched the SFLPhone project.
In November 2009, CIO magazine listed SFLphone among the top five open-source VoIP softphones to watch.
In May 2015, SFLphone was renamed to Ring. 
In November 2016, Ring was integrated into the GNU project. Ring is free and open-source software released under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
In December 2018, Ring was renamed to Jami to avoid confusion with commercial products also using the English term Ring.


== Use and design ==
Jami is an open-source voice over IP, videotelephony, and instant messaging platform. In 2025, TechRadar listed it as one alternative to Skype following its discontinuation.
By default, Jami uses an OpenDHT node maintained by Savoir-faire Linux to join the network when the user connects for the first time. However, the application gives users the choice to run this through their own server.
Jami is available on various desktop (GNU/Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows), mobile (Android and iOS), television (Android TV), and server platforms. Jami for Web, allowing access with a web browser, has not yet been released to the public.
