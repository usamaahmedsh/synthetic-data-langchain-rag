Age of Empires: World Domination featured eight historical civilisations, resource management, a variety of heroes, exploration, and technological research, similarly to the PC games in the series. Additionally, an extra civilisation, the Koreans, was later added to the game. Also like the PC series, the game made use of the four resources of wood, food, gold, and stone, and had similar buildings such as the barracks, the archery range, and the mill, and advancement through the ages with an associated technology tree.
