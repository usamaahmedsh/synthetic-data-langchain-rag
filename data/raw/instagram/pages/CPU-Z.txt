CPU-Z is a freeware system profiling and monitoring application for Microsoft Windows and Android that detects the central processing unit, RAM, motherboard chipset, and other hardware features of a modern personal computer or Android device.


== Features ==
CPU-Z is more comprehensive in virtually all areas compared to the tools provided in Windows to identify various hardware components, and thus assists in identifying certain components without the need of opening the case; particularly the core revision and RAM clock rate. It also provides information on the system's GPU.
