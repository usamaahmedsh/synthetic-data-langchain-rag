"She Bop" is a song by American singer-songwriter Cyndi Lauper, written by Lauper, Stephen Broughton Lunt, Gary Corbett, and Rick Chertoff, and produced by the lattermost. It was released on July 2, 1984, via Portrait Records as the third single from her debut studio album She's So Unusual (1983). Lyrically, the song talks about the subject of female masturbation, which caused controversy upon its release at the time.
One of Lauper's most successful singles, "She Bop" peaked within the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching number three in September 1984. The track peaked within the top ten of Australia and New Zealand, reached the top twenty of the European Hot 100 Singles chart, and topped the Israeli Singles Chart. Due to a lack of promotion, the track stalled at number 46 in the United Kingdom. The music video for the track, which utilized animated segments and multiple visual effects, would receive a nomination at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video. Lauper would re-record a quieter version of the song for her 2005 studio album The Body Acoustic.


== Recording and composition ==
"She Bop" moves at a tempo of 137 beats per minute. The song was recorded at Record Plant Studios in New York City and was produced by Rick Chertoff. Lauper said she recorded the song naked in an interview with The Howard Stern Show.


=== Lyrical content ===
The track is an ode to masturbation. It was included on the Parents Music Resource Center's "Filthy Fifteen" list in 1984 due to it being considered "profane or sexually explicit"; this led to the creation of the Parental Advisory sticker. Lauper has stated that finding a copy of gay men's magazine Blueboy lying around in the recording studio provided the impetus for writing "She Bop". The magazine is mentioned in the first verse.


== Reception ==
Cash Box said that "with characteristic zaniness, Lauper takes a be-bop back beat and sparks it with an inspired vocal that pops and chirps with rhythmic intensity."


== Chart performance ==
"She Bop" was released on July 2, 1984. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 52 in the issue dated July 21, 1984, and spent a total of 18 weeks on the chart, reaching a peak position of No. 3 in the issue dated September 8, 1984. It was the third single from Lauper's debut album to make the top 10 of the Hot 100. The single also reached number 10 on the Hot Dance/Club Play Songs chart the week of September 15, 1984, and placed at 34 on the Billboard year-end chart of 1984. On April 17, 1989, the song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for the shipment of half a million copies across the United States.


== Music video ==
The accompanying music video for "She Bop" was directed by Edd Griles. Mark Marek designed the characters in the animated sections of this music video, which were produced and directed by Jerry Lieberman, of NYC's Jerry Lieberman Productions, and the cover of the US 12" version. Wendi Richter, Lou Albano, and Gary Howard Klar appear in the video, with Richter lip-synching the first line of the song.
The video expands upon the references to masturbation in the song's lyrics, although not overtly. Among the images presented are an upright bottle shooting mayonnaise into the air, a sign at a gas station that displays 'GIT OFF HERE', gas pumps (labelled 'good x', 'better xx', 'nirvana xxx', 'single', and 'multiple'), a large sign that reads "Self Service", a dance sequence where Lauper portrays a blind person with a cane, and that same person winning a game of "Masterbingo"– both a reference to the myth that masturbation causes blindness. Most of the more blatant references appear during the animated instrumental sequence, although subtle images are seen throughout the live action scenes.
At the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for "Best Female Video", but lost to Tina Turner's "What's Love Got to Do with It".
British music magazine Melody Maker complimented the video, noting that it worked well because "Lauper has a certain Boop-cheeked charm" and also because of the "superb bits of animation" used in it.
