The Canadian Music Hall of Fame was established in 1978 by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS) to honour Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements in music. The award presentation is held each year as part of the Juno Award ceremonies. Since 2012, the inductee also performs at the ceremony.
A hall facility was opened in Calgary in 2016 located within The National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta. It can be found on level five of the Studio Bell, a floor entirely dedicated to celebrating and recognizing Canadian music creators and artists who have left their mark on this country and beyond.


== Inductees ==
As of 2026 CARAS has honored 71 bands or individual musicians. To date, Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings are the only artists to be inducted twice, once for their work with The Guess Who and again for Bachman's work with Bachman–Turner Overdrive and Cummings for his solo work.
