Enyo is an open source JavaScript framework for cross-platform mobile, desktop, TV and web applications emphasizing object-oriented encapsulation and modularity. Initially developed by Palm, it was later acquired by Hewlett-Packard in April 2010 and then released under an Apache 2.0 license. It is sponsored by LG Electronics and Hewlett-Packard.


== Bootplate ==
Bootplate is a simplified way of creating an app, providing a skeleton of the program's folder tree. The Bootplate template provides a complete starter project that supports source control and cross-platform deployment out of the box. It can be used to facilitate both the creation of a new project and the preparation for its eventual deployment.


== Libraries ==
Layout: Fittables, scrollers, lists, drawers, panels.
Onyx: Based on the original styled of webOS/Touchpad design but available for use on any platform.
Moonstone: Used by LG SmartTV apps but available for use on any platform.
Spotlight: To support key-based interactions and "point and click" events on remote controls and keyboards.
Mochi: Advanced user interface library. It has been maintained by the community since the team behind webOS released this abandoned interface from Palm/HP as open source. This library  is not included on bootplate right now, but has design documents.
enyo-iLib: Internationalization and localization library, it wrap ilib's functionality on Enyo apps. G11n was another library that has been deprecated on newer versions of enyo.
