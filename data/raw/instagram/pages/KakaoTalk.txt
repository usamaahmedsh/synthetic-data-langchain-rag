KakaoTalk (Korean: 카카오톡), commonly referred to as KaTalk (카톡) in South Korea, is an instant messenger and online services platform operated by Kakao Corporation. It was launched in 2010 and the app is available on mobile and desktop platforms.
KakaoTalk is the most popular instant messaging app in South Korea, and since its debut in March 2010, the service has captured around 90 percent of the local market. Originally designed for messaging, it has evolved into becoming a super-app providing mobile payments and banking, taxi hailing, games and others.


== History ==
Kakao started with KakaoTalk, an instant messaging application in March 2010, and followed up with a social media network that integrated with the messenger app.  
Kakao's next step into Korea's Lifestyle habits was to tap into one of the mobile gaming markets. The addition of Kakaogames allowed users to connect and play with their offline friends all through the convenience of the Kakao network.
Kakao Friends emoticons were introduced in 2012.
Since then, Kakao has continued to expand its platform by providing a gift shop called Kakao gift. KakaoTalk was nominated for the Most Innovative Mobile App Award at the Global Mobile Awards 2014.
Kakao Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet service by Kakao based in South Korea that allows users to make mobile payments and online transactions. The payment service first launched on 4 September 2014 with integration with their messaging app, KakaoTalk, allowing people to request and send money to people in their contacts.
Kakao has taken steps to make KakaoTalk a safer platform. In December 2020, KakaoTalk introduced Safebot, an AI-based comment-filtering function. 
The company also rolled out an artificial intelligence (AI) recommendation function for the gift section, aimed at making it easier for users to send gifts whilst searching for items.
In September 23, 2025, Kakao announced a big update to modernize the app. However, the new update created criticism related to the feed-style display of the friends tab.  After the harsh criticism, in September 29, 2025, Kakao said they will rollback to the original UI as a default view for the friends tab.  However, KakaoTalk re-announced in October 15th, 2025, Woo Young-gyu, vice president of Kakao, that it is technically impossible to roll back the update to a previous version.

== Influence ==


=== Korean ===
A solitary chat room is a kind of open chat room, where many anonymous people gather to talk about specific topics, communicating only with images, without using text or emoticons. In other words, it is making a story out of images only.
Similar chat rooms have sprung up as an open chat room that exchanges food pictures without a word became popular. As the popularity of the celebrity themed "solitary chat rooms" grew, celebrities went into the chat room themselves.
Darcie Draudt-Véjares of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argues that KakaoTalk and other social networks were one reason (alongside other factors such as a cultural emphasis on civic duty) why South Korean citizens came out in such huge numbers to oppose president Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law during the 2024 South Korean martial law crisis. These platforms allowed pro-democracy activists to spread their message to millions of users and quickly organize and direct protests and demonstrations.


=== International ===
KakaoTalk is available in 15 languages and used in over 130 countries. On July 26, 2011, Kakao Corp. established Japanese Corp., Kakao Japan and appointed Cha-Jin Park as a representative. According to company officials, the app appears to be very actively used in Japan. When a massive earthquake hit Japan on March 11, 2011, KakaoTalk's messaging traffic in Japan surged as millions of people sought to confirm the safety of friends and family. KakaoTalk played an important role as a data network-based communication method; it successfully replaced disabled wired and wireless networks and helped connect the disaster-stricken.
KakaoTalk has targeted countries in Southeast Asia where no dominant mobile messenger service stands. KakaoTalk is forming strategic partnerships in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, as well.  In 2013, KakaoTalk began airing TV commercials in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam featuring Big Bang. In the ads, local celebrities and BigBang appear together to promote KakaoTalk. In late 2013, Indonesia became the country with the second-most users of KakaoTalk, after South Korea, with 13 million users and the potential to become KakaoTalk's largest market worldwide. The former co-CEO of KakaoTalk, Sirgoo Lee, stated "We grew our user base by more than 25 times in one year, so hopefully, we will continue at that rate." KakaoTalk has tailored their service to the local environment by collaborating with local designers and companies to generate "Indonesian-specific content". In February 2014, KakaoTalk launched for Nokia Asha 500, 501, 502, and 503 devices, expanding its reach to users of a wider audience.
