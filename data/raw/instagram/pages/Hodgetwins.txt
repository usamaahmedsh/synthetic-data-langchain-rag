The Hodgetwins (born September 17, 1975), also known as the Conservative Twins, are an American stand-up comedy and conservative political commentary duo consisting of twin brothers Keith and Kevin Hodge. The twins started out as YouTubers, but in 2016 branched out to live stand-up comedy shows.
They were at VidCon 2016, and The Root included them in a list of twelve of the best and brightest black creators at the event.


== Biography ==
The twins were born and raised in Martinsville, Virginia, and attended Fieldale-Collinsville High School where they graduated in 1992. They enlisted in the Marine Corps and by 2013 they had over half a million subscribers on YouTube.
In 2019, two of their cousins' children were shot, so they used their social media presence to raise money for their medical expenses.
Both have been married to their current wives for over 15 years, and lived in Los Angeles for 17 years.  They currently reside in Las Vegas.
They are Christian.


== Fitness ==
The Hodge twins are certified International Sports Sciences Association trainers and appeared on the front page of Train magazine. In 2016, they were guests on comedy podcast The Fighter and the Kid. In 2016, CheatSheet rated them as the 4th-best fitness YouTube channel.


== Comedy ==
They have toured the UK and Australia. Their No Filter tour took place in 2016.


== Conservative commentators ==
The Hodge twins are vocal conservatives, and have over three million subscribers on their Conservative Twins YouTube channel. The twins are Donald Trump supporters, and appeared on Trump's Real News Update webcast. They oppose the Black Lives Matter political and social movement.
Two of the most shared Facebook posts about the George Floyd protests originated from the Hodge twins. They are frequent guests on conservative comedian Steven Crowder's various programs.
Some claims the twins have made about Joe Biden and Black Lives Matter have been deemed as false by fact-checkers. 
In 2019, a venue canceled one of their shows after the Hodgetwins posted a video to their YouTube account making fun of a transgender woman. The venue owner stated the reason for the cancellation was that "[they] don't tolerate transphobia."
