The company also sells physical "gimmix" to complement their magic applications.

== Recognition ==
In December 2008, Apple Inc. released a series of lists that showed the top downloads of the year from the App Store. The lists showed the 10 most-downloaded applications from different categories, in no particular order. The iBeer application from Hottrix appeared in both the "Top Paid Apps (Overall)" and "Top Paid Entertainment" lists.
iBeer was also called a "must-have" application by CNN Money. Hottrix was praised by Condé Nast Portfolio for their trick software, with iBeer singled out as "the perfect gift".


== Intellectual property ==
In October 2008, Hottrix filed a US$12.5 million lawsuit against Coors Brewing Company for developing an application called iPint for iOS. The suit alleged that Coors violated copyright law by making a program similar to iBeer. Apple removed iPint from the App Store in the United States after receiving a complaint from Hottrix.

=== App Store apps ===
These tricks are available at the App Store.


==== HottrixPhone ====
This trick gives the appearance of a phone call with a celebrity, including real pre-recorded voices of same. Multiple celebrities are available in the application, including Elvis Presley and Barack Obama, and the ability for users to add others.


==== iBeer ====

iBeer is a trick that gives the illusion that the device screen "fills" with many varieties of beer (including sound). If the device is tilted, the virtual beer swishes around to give the illusion of truly being filled with beer. The beer can be "drained" if the device is tilted enough, and a belch sounds when the beer has been completely drained. iBeer appeared in both the "Top Paid Apps (Overall)" and "Top Paid Entertainment" lists published by Apple in December 2008.


==== iBug ====
iBug is a trick that gives the appearance of a virtual insect appearing on the screen of the device. It responds to touch and can get fat. The bug laughs when the device is shaken.


==== iMilk ====
iMilk is a trick similar to iBeer, but appears as different varieties of milk, such as chocolate milk, strawberry milk, and "martian milk." iMilk has a pay trick and a magic button to perform various tricks with money.


==== iMunchies ====
iMunchies is a trick that gives the illusion that the device is filling with many varieties of snacks such as candy, nuts, and popcorn. A person could then pretend to pull snacks out of the device by reaching beneath it and retrieving a previously-hidden snack using sleight of hand. The snacks can also be poured out of the device.


==== iSoda ====
iSoda is a trick similar to iBeer and iMilk, but with various soft drinks, such as cola, energy drink, and fizzy water.


==== Jarheads ====
Jarhead Bob, Jarhead Tim, and Jarhead Ned are tricks that have dungeon lab samples in potent juice. The heads roll their eyes when the device is tilted and the juice turns into blood when shaken. The liquid drains when the device is tilted enough, similar to iBeer.
