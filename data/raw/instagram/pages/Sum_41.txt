== History ==


=== 1994–1998: Formative years ===
Sum 41 has its origins in the band Kaspir, which was formed by Deryck Whibley and Grant McVittie in 1994, inspired by Weezer and Nirvana. As time went on, the band's drummer was replaced by Steve Jocz and the music became increasingly inspired by NOFX, particularly their 1991 album Ribbed. Seeing this change as too sonically dissimilar to their original sound, they decided to form a new band and to change their sound because they sounded "like the early nineties rock music we used to listen to, and don't anymore". The band chose the name "Sum 41" after looking at the calendar and counting how many days it had been from the start of their summer break to the day the Warped Tour was on and seeing that it was forty-one days. The band debuted its new name during Supernova's Battle of the Bands on September 28, 1996. The first lineup to use this name included Whibley, Jocz, McVittie and Jon Marshall. Another early member was bassist Richard Roy who shortly replaced McVittie.
Their first televised live performance was at Jonopalooza, on the Canadian teen talk show Jonovision hosted by Trailer Park Boys star, and Canadian comedian, Jonathan Torrens.
The band met their manager and producer Greig Nori, also the lead vocalist of the band Treble Charger, in 1996 at Jonopalooza, and Whibley convinced Nori to watch his band perform.  Nori was not impressed with the band's songs or the original vocalist Jon Marshall and advised Whibley to be the vocalist instead causing Marshall to leave.  With Whibley moving to lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Dave Baksh, a friend of Deryck and Steve and fellow student at Exeter High School, joined as lead guitarist. During the band's first tour in New Brunswick, the band was involved in a near-fatal car accident, when their Ford Econoline van was broadsided by an F-150; Roy, who was driving the van, quit the band after returning home. Mark Spicoluk briefly filled in as the band's new bassist in 1998, until he was replaced by Jason McCaslin, another friend of the band's and student at Exeter High School, in 1999. In 1996, the band opened for Len.


=== 1998–2000: Half Hour of Power ===

In 1998, the band recorded a demo tape on compact cassette which they sent to record companies in the hope of getting a recording contract.
From 1999 to 2000, the band recorded several new songs. The Introduction to Destruction and later the Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's DVDs both contain the self-recorded footage, which show the band performing a dance to "Makes No Difference" in front of a theatre.
After signing with Island Records in 1999, Sum 41's first EP, Half Hour of Power, was released on June 27, 2000. The first single released by the band was "Makes No Difference", which had two different music videos. The first video was put together using the video clips sent to the major label, and the second showed the band performing at a house party. The album was certified platinum in Canada.


=== 2001–2003: All Killer No Filler and Does This Look Infected? ===

Sum 41's first full-length album, All Killer No Filler, was released on May 8, 2001. The album was very successful; it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in August 2001. "Fat Lip", the album's first single, achieved significant chart and commercial success; it topped the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart as well as many other charts around the world. The song remains the band's most successful to date. After "Fat Lip", two more singles were released from the album: "In Too Deep" and "Motivation". "In Too Deep" peaked at number 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, while "Motivation" peaked at number 24 on the same chart. The album peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200 chart and at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums chart. The album was a commercial success, and was certified Platinum in the United States, UK, and triple platinum in Canada The album's name was taken from the initial reaction from Joe Mcgrath, an engineer working in the studio.
The band spent much of 2001 touring; the group played over 300 concerts that year before returning to the studio to record another album. The band took part in the 2001 Vans Warped Tour and the Campus Invasion Tour. In April 2002, the band went on a month long tour called the Sum Like it Loud Tour.
On May 3, 2002, Spider-Man was released in theaters which featured an extended version of the song from Sum 41's first album "Half Hour of Power" called  "What We're All About", which in the album was combined with another short song called "Dave's Possessed Hair". The song was listed on the album as "Dave's Possessed Hair/It's What We're All About".
In October 2002, the band went on a month long tour called the Sum on Your Face Tour. On November 26, 2002, the group released its second album, Does This Look Infected? The special edition came with a DVD, Cross The T's and Gouge Your I's. Whibley said of the album: "We don't want to make another record that sounds like the last record, I hate when bands repeat albums." The album featured a harder and edgier sound, and the lyrics featured a more serious outlook. The album peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200 chart and at number eight on the Top Canadian Albums chart. It was certified Platinum in Canada and gold in the United States.
The first single released from the album was "Still Waiting", which peaked at number seven on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single, "The Hell Song" peaked at number 13 on the chart. "The Hell Song"'s music video depicted the band members using dolls with their pictures on them and others, such as Korn, Kiss, AC/DC, Snoop Dogg, Destiny's Child, Ozzy Osbourne, Sharon Osbourne, and Pamela Anderson. The third single, "Over My Head (Better Off Dead)", had a video released exclusively in Canada and on the band's website, featuring live shots of the band. The video also appeared on the group's live DVD, Sake Bombs and Happy Endings (2003), as a bonus feature. The band again began a long tour to promote the album before recording the group's third studio album.


=== 2004–2005: Chuck ===

In late May 2004, the band travelled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo with War Child Canada, a branch of the British charity organization War Child, to document the effects of the country's civil war. There had been a stoppage in fighting for almost a year and a half, yet days after arriving, fighting broke out in Bukavu near the hotel where the band was staying. The band waited for the fighting to die down, but it did not. A UN peacekeeper, Charles "Chuck" Pelletier, called for armoured carriers to take the hotel's occupants out of the hot zone. After nearly twenty hours, the carriers arrived, and the band and forty other civilians were taken to safety.
In honour of Pelletier, Sum 41 named its next album Chuck; it was released on October 12, 2004. The album charted at number 10 on the Billboard 200 chart. It also peaked at number two on the Canadian Albums chart. The album received positive reviews, and was certified Platinum in Canada and gold in the United States.
The first single from the album was "We're All To Blame", which peaked at number 10 on the Alternative Airplay chart. It was followed by "Pieces", which reached the top of the charts in Canada. In 2004, the band went on a co-headlining North American Tour with Good Charlotte. The band joined Mötley Crüe on their Carnival of Sin summer tour as an opening act.
A documentary of the band's experience in Congo was made into a film called Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo and later aired on MTV. War Child released it on DVD on November 29, 2005, in the United States and Canada. Following the album's release, the band went on a tour with Good Charlotte until 2006. On December 21, 2005, Sum 41 released a live album, Happy Live Surprise, in Japan. The CD contained a full concert recorded live in London, Ontario. The same CD was released March 7, 2006, in Canada under the name Go Chuck Yourself. The band played videos before its set that were deemed "unsuitable for children". Controversy arose over some of the videos' violent content.


=== 2006–2008: Baksh's departure and Underclass Hero ===

On May 10, 2006, Dave Baksh, via a statement through management, announced that he was leaving Sum 41 to work with his new band, Brown Brigade, which has a more "classic metal" sound. Baksh cited "creative differences" as the reason for his departure, but claimed that he was still on good terms with the band.
The next day, Whibley confirmed Baksh's official departure and announced that the band would only replace him with a touring guitarist, who would not have any decision-making power in the band or be in videos, photo shoots, or albums. The band hired Gob frontman and guitarist Tom Thacker to replace Baksh.

On April 17, 2007, the band released a song on iTunes, "March of the Dogs". Whibley was threatened with deportation from the United States for the song, because he metaphorically "killed the president" on it. The band's fourth studio album, Underclass Hero was released on July 23, 2007.
The album, backed by the first single and title track, "Underclass Hero", was released on July 24, 2007. Despite mixed reviews, the album was a commercial success, debuting at number seven on the Billboard 200 and at number one on the Billboard Rock Albums chart, the band's highest US chart position to date. It also peaked at number one on the Canadian Albums chart and on the Alternative Albums chart. Two more singles were released from the album, "Walking Disaster" and "With Me". Underclass Hero was certified Platinum in Canada. On September 15, 2007, the band headlined the House of Blues with Yellowcard.
In October 2007, the band began the Strength in Numbers Tour, a tour of Canada with Canadian band Finger Eleven; Die Mannequin opened each of Sum 41's shows. During the tour, Whibley sustained a herniated disk. As a result, the group cancelled the rest of its shows. After Whibley recovered from his injury, the band continued the Underclass Hero tour in March 2008 and toured until early July, when the group began preparation for its next album.
Sum 41 released a greatest hits album in Japan titled 8 Years of Blood, Sake and Tears in November 2008. The album included a previously unreleased song, "Always", and a DVD, which contains each of the band's music videos. On March 17, the band released the worldwide version of the album, titled All the Good Shit.


=== 2009–2012: Thacker's official arrival and Screaming Bloody Murder ===

In July 2009, the band was an opening act for The Offspring on their Shit is Fucked Up Tour. Drummer Steve Jocz confirmed that Tom Thacker was now an official member of Sum 41, and would take part in the writing and recording. On November 5, 2009, Whibley posted a blog on the band's MySpace page announcing Gil Norton as the producer of the band's upcoming album, also saying that 20 songs were already written for the album. In an interview with Tom Thacker, some working titles for songs for the new album were confirmed, including "Panic Attack", "Jessica Kill" and "Like Everyone Else". Pre-production for the new album took 13 days in December 2009, with the band officially entering the studio to begin recording at Perfect Sound Studios on January 26, 2010. The new studio album, titled Screaming Bloody Murder, was expected for a late 2010 release, but was delayed until early 2011. The band finished recording on June 24, 2010, just before joining the 2010 Warped Tour. While the group was on the tour, the new album entered the post-production stages of mixing and mastering. A new song called "Skumfuk" was leaked online on July 6, 2010. In an interview with Canoe.ca, Steve Jocz said that while producer Gil Norton was originally hired to engineer the new album, he was only around for a week and Sum 41 self-produced the record. From October to November 2010, the band headlined the Eastpak Antidote Tour.

The first single from the album, "Screaming Bloody Murder", was released on February 7, 2011, in the United States. On February 28, 2011, a stream of "Blood in My Eyes", another new song from the album, was released for free listening on Alternative Press. The album Screaming Bloody Murder was released on March 29, 2011. On May 28, 2011, Sum 41 performed a live set for Guitar Center Sessions on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host Nic Harcourt.
"Baby You Don't Wanna Know" was released as the album's second single. A music video was also produced for the first single, "Screaming Bloody Murder", but it was left unreleased due to its content and difficulties with executives of the band.
On August 9, 2011, Sum 41 released the live album Live at the House of Blues, Cleveland 9.15.07 – a live recording of a show that took place on September 15, 2007, in Cleveland, Ohio, while the band was touring its previous album Underclass Hero. A week later when the band was touring the US as part of the Vans Warped Tour, they were forced once again to cancel all remaining dates, when Whibley re-injured his back after playing three shows. It was announced on the band's official website that they would be postponing indefinitely all upcoming tour dates for 2011 while Whibley underwent treatment. In 2011, Sum 41 was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for the song "Blood in My Eyes", but lost to the Foo Fighters.
In February 2012, the band shot a music video for the song "Blood in My Eyes", the third single from the album, with director Michael Maxxis in Los Angeles. It was released officially released on September 10, 2012.

== Side projects and collaborations ==
Before the release of Half Hour of Power, and up until the departures of Dave Baksh and Steve Jocz, Sum 41 occasionally played as an alter ego 1980s heavy metal band called Pain for Pleasure during shows. The band appeared in Sum 41's music videos for "Fat Lip" and "We're All to Blame" and had at least one song on each of the band's first three releases. The group's best known song under the Pain for Pleasure moniker is the song of the same name from All Killer No Filler, a track that remains the band's staple during live shows and features drummer Steve Jocz on lead vocals. During the Don't Call It a Sum-Back Tour in 2017, Pain for Pleasure appeared performing the song at the end of their show with guitarist Tom Thacker replacing Jocz as the vocalist.
Sum 41 has collaborated with many other artists, both live and in the studio, including: MC Shan, Tenacious D, Ludacris, Iggy Pop, Pennywise, Bowling for Soup, Unwritten Law, Mike Shinoda, Treble Charger, Gob, Tommy Lee, Rob Halford, Kerry King, Metallica, Ja Rule, DMC, and Nothing,Nowhere.
Shortly after touring for Does This Look Infected?, Sum 41 was recruited by Iggy Pop for his album, Skull Ring. Whibley co-wrote the first single from the album, "Little Know It All", and joined Iggy on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote it. Following the band's show of September 11, 2005, in Quebec City, Quebec, the band went on a touring hiatus, although on April 17, 2006, Sum 41 played at a tribute to Iggy Pop, joining Iggy on stage for "Little Know It All" and "Lust For Life".
During the band's 2006 touring hiatus, Whibley focused on his producing career: he produced two songs for Avril Lavigne's album The Best Damn Thing. Jocz recorded his first video as director for a Canadian band, The Midway State, and McCaslin started a side project with Todd Morse of H2O and Juliette and the Licks. McCaslin's two-person band, named The Operation M.D., released its debut album, We Have an Emergency, in early 2007. In 2022, Whibley was featured on the Simple Plan single, "Ruin My Life".


== Musical style and influences ==

Sum 41 has been described as pop-punk, skate punk, punk rock, heavy metal, alternative metal, melodic hardcore, alternative rock, pop rock, punk metal, arena rock, and hard rock.
In a November 2004 interview, Deryck Whibley said: "We don't even consider ourselves punk. We're just a rock band. We want to do something different. We want to do our own thing. That's how music has always been to us." Dave Baksh reiterated Whibley's claims, stating "We just call ourselves rock... It's easier to say than punk, especially around all these fuckin' kids that think they know what punk is. Something that was based on not having any rules has probably one of the strictest fucking rule books in the world."
Sum 41's musical style has consistently changed between albums. The band's EP Half Hour of Power is described as pop-punk and skate punk. All Killer No Filler was also described as pop-punk and skate punk (except for "Pain for Pleasure", which is purely heavy metal). Does This Look Infected? has been described as punk rock, pop-punk melodic hardcore, horror punk, and heavy metal. Chuck moved into a sound influenced by heavy metal and hardcore punk, and has been categorised by critics as alternative metal, thrash metal and melodic hardcore. Underclass Hero was as a revival of the band's pop-punk style, however differentiated itself from their early work through its heavy use of acoustic guitars, complex vocal harmonies, pianos and organs. Screaming Bloody Murder saw the band turn in a much darker direction. Sonically it was a return to metal, while also incorporating elements of garage rock and, on some songs, progressive rock. 13 Voices and Order in Decline saw the band continue in this heavier direction, incorporating elements of hardcore punk, metalcore and thrash metal. Their final album, Heaven :x: Hell, is a double album which features both a return to the pop-punk sound of the band's early career, and a continuation of the band's later heavy metal sound. This album was also described as skate punk, alternative rock, and alternative metal.
Some of the band's songs contain political-social commentary; "Still Waiting" is an anti-George W. Bush and anti-Iraq War song, "The Jester" and "March of the Dogs" also are critical of Bush, "45 (A Matter of Time)" is critical of U.S. president Donald Trump, "Underclass Hero" is a song about class struggle, and "Dear Father" and "Never There" are about Whibley's absent father.
Sum 41's influences include Weezer, Slayer, the Police, Devo, Megadeth, Pennywise, Refused, Rancid, No Use for a Name, the Vandals, Anthrax, Carcass, Dio, Judas Priest, Foo Fighters, Green Day, NOFX, Lagwagon, Face to Face, Nirvana, the Beatles (including John Lennon's solo work), Elvis Costello, Beastie Boys, Run–D.M.C., Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and Iron Maiden.
Sum 41 has inspired modern artists such as 5 Seconds of Summer, Seaway, Dune Rats, Marshmello, PVRIS, Trash Boat, Neck Deep, the Vamps, Bully, Waterparks, and Roam.
