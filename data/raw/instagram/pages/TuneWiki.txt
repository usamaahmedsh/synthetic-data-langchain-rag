TuneWiki had agreements with the major music publishers including Sony, Universal, and EMI to legally use synchronized lyrics in TuneWiki's music applications.
TuneWiki provided real-time scrolling lyrics that display as a song plays, for songs saved on the phone as well as for songs played through streaming radio, provided that the user first synchronizes the initial line of textual lyrics with the correct verse of the playing song.
A geolocation feature located songs playing in the area of the user, and included social media functionality for posting to popular social media websites.
Users were able to follow other users to discover and discuss the music they listen to.


== Supported devices ==
TuneWiki had applications released for iPhone and iPod Touch, Android, Windows Phone 7, BlackBerry, Symbian S60v5, Nokia Series 40 (Java based) and Maemo, with a plugin for Windows Media Player, as well as an app for Spotify.

TuneWiki was selected by various wireless carriers (such as Verizon Wireless) to preload their application onto cellphones before sale, typically accompanied by OS settings which prevent the owner of the device from deleting the application.
