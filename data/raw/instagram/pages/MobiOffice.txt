MobiOffice (formerly OfficeSuite) is a proprietary cross-platform office suite application developed by MobiSystems. It has versions for Android, iOS and Microsoft Windows and has compatibility with the most frequently used Microsoft Office file formats. The software has over 220 million downloads on Google Play and is among the top Android business applications.
MobiOffice is preinstalled on devices by Sony, Amazon, Alcatel, Sharp, Toshiba, ZTE, Huawei, Kyocera and more.


== History ==
The software was first released as a mobile application on Palm OS in 2004 (incorporating older MobiSystems apps: Quick Spell, Quick Check and Quick Write), followed by Symbian in 2005.
Until 2009, OfficeSuite (MobiOffice's former name) was mainly used as a reader. Later, MobiSystems received an inquiry by Sony for an Android-based office solution development, however it was required in just 12 weeks. Apparently the developers succeeded and Sony preinstalled the newly developed OfficeSuite on all of their Android devices in 2009.
The software debuted on iOS in 2013, and the first desktop client version for Windows appeared in 2016.
Besides the ability to connect to any cloud provider such as Google Drive, Box, iCloud, OneDrive and more, MobiOffice offers storage space in MobiSystems's proprietary cloud: MobiDrive. 
In 2018 the app was selected by Google to be among the few to receive the Android Excellence Award.
