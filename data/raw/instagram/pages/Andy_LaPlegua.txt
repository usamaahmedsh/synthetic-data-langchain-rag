Ole Anders Olsen (born 15 September 1975), known professionally as Andy LaPlegua, is a Norwegian singer, originally known for being founder and lead vocalist of futurepop band Icon of Coil. He also gained fame in the aggrotech and electro-industrial scenes as founder and lead vocalist of Combichrist and Panzer AG.


== Biography ==
Following the death of Prince, LaPlegua revealed that the biggest musical influences in his life growing up in the early '80s were David Bowie, Motörhead, Prince, The Cure, and Dead Kennedys.
Originally a part of several scenes in Norway, LaPlegua experimented with hip-hop in the Detroit techno/Old School band LAW, industrial in Devils into Crime, punk in My Right Choice/Fleshfire and metal in Lash Out. He also found interest in trance and club music making his mark on the scene with his involvement in the bands Plastic Life and Sector9.
Early on, he was the vocalist in Fredrikstad based hardcore/metal band My Right Choice - who released an EP under the project name Fleshfire, as well as stand-in (and later permanent) vocalist for Lash Out.
Icon of Coil was formed as a solo project in 1997. After becoming very enthusiastic about the music and its possibilities, LaPlegua invited a former bandmate of his, Sebastian Komor to join Icon of Coil to perform live. After several public performances and the release of "Shallow Nation", IoC's first album, Komor joined the band full-time.
Combichrist was officially launched in 2003. It was created as a more aggressive alternative to Icon of Coil. Panzer AG was officially launched in 2004. LaPlegua combined the danceability of Icon of Coil and the hard-hitting beats of Combichrist when he created Panzer AG. His fourth, most techno-oriented project, is (DJ) Scandy. His new project, Scandinavian Cock, is a rockabilly/psychobilly act.


== Personal life ==
LaPlegua was married to German model and actress Sophia Thomalla in March 2016, and they announced their divorce a year later in May 2017. In December 2018 he was engaged to Liv Blankenship; they married in 2020. As of March 2024, he is engaged to Maegan McKenney.
