Guadalupe is a town in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States and part of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. The town motto, "where three cultures flourish", recognizes the town's roots in the Yaquis, Mexicans and descendants of the original farmers. Since its founding, Guadalupe has been known as a center of Yaqui culture, and it is home to many religious festivals. Nestled between Phoenix and Tempe, the 2020 census listed the population of the town as 5,322. Guadalupe was founded around 1900 by Yaqui Indians, who fled their homeland in Sonora to avoid oppression by the Mexican government of Porfirio Díaz. The cemetery of Guadalupe was established in 1904, in the original townsite. The cemetery is now officially located in Tempe, due to that city's annexation of the land surrounding the cemetery; however, it is still administered by the Guadalupe Clerk's Office. Guadalupe is primarily a residential area; most residents commute to other parts of the Phoenix area to work.
