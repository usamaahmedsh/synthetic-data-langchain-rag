== History ==
The club was founded on February 1, 1932, and since its first year the club has been competing in tournaments organized by the Federação Paulista de Futebol (Paulista Football Federation).
The club became a professional team in the 1950s, but its results were poor at the beginning. In the 1980s, after the arrival of Wilson de Barros as club president, Mogi Mirim began to see results and eventually was promoted to the Campeonato Paulista first division. The club was relegated to the second division in 1994, but was promoted again to the first division the following year.
In 2008, Rivaldo, who is one of the most famous Brazilian footballers, became the chairman of the club.
In December 2014, shortly after the club's promotion to the Série B, Rivaldo put the club up for sale on Instagram. In the following year, the club returned to the Série C, and after that, the team suffered a string of consecutive relegations in both national and state levels, ending with a relegation to the state fourth level in 2018. After playing the Campeonato Paulista Segunda Divisão editions in 2021 and 2023, Mogi Mirim has been licensed from professional football.


== Stadium ==

The Romildo Vitor Gomes Ferreira stadium was previously known as Papa João Paulo II, named after Pope John Paul II, but after the ex-player Rivaldo became the club's president, he decided to change the stadium's name after his father's name.
