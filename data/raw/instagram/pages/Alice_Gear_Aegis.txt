== Reception ==

The Alice Gear Aegis Expansion anime adaptation received mixed reviews. Alex Henderson of Anime Feminist reviewed the first episode, stating the world of fighting aliens in space seems "unrelated to the cutesy character storyline" which comprises the premiere, and called it "very silly" because the lore and tone, in Henderson's view, are "so at odds" with one another, with a refusal to engage with the sci-fi premise.
