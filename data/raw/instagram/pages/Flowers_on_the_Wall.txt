The song (its 1975 version) is used in the soundtrack to the 1994  film Pulp Fiction. In the film, Bruce Willis's character sings along to the line, "smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo" as he is driving.
The song is also referenced in the 1995 film Die Hard with a Vengeance where Bruce Willis's character says he was "working on a nice fat suspension, smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo" .
Kurt Vonnegut quotes the song's complete lyrics in his 1981 book Palm Sunday, calling the song "yet another great contemporary poem by the Statler Brothers" and using it to describe "the present condition" of an American man who had recently departed his family. "It is not a poem of escape or rebirth. It is a poem about the end of a man's usefulness", he adds.
It is the theme song of the radio series Linda Smith's A Brief History of Timewasting.
The Muppets covered the song in 2015, sung by a group of rats called 'The Ratler Brothers', (a clear reference to the Statler Brothers), and released an accompanying music video. The chorus lyrics were modernized and removed the reference to smoking, replacing it with activities such as Instagram stalking and playing sudoku.
An instrumental version was used for the long-running TVNZ sheepdog trialling TV series A Dog's Show
