Fishbrain is a mobile app and social media platform made for anglers.
Its features include map-based tools, social networking features, fishing forecasts including weather, lunar cycles, tidal charts, map functionality, predicted fish activity, analysis of species behavior, and suggestions on fishing gear.


== History ==
Fishbrain was created by Jens Lindman and Johan Attby, and launched in 2010 as a free mobile app, and has expanded to include utility functions for recreational fishing with some of its features available with an option for a subscription. The Fishbrain app is downloadable from the App Store and Google Play and has been made available for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.
In 2019, Fishbrain added a marketplace where anglers can buy fishing gear. This marketplace is offered as an online service and an in-app service. It features gear advice based on catch data. This allows anglers to see which gear is best for catching specific species, or for specific fishing tactics.
The platform has a user base of over 11 million users, allowing users to access to a variety of data on species, migratory patterns, and more. Fishbrain has worked with governmental agencies to help identify endangered fish species and how climate is impacting behavioral patterns.
Fishbrain has received multiple rounds of funding to support its expansion, including investments from venture capital firms such as B Capital, Softbank Ventures Asia, and Industrifonden. Most recently the company raised a Series B round of $13.5 million USD in 2018.
