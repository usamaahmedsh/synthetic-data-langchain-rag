TringMe is an Indian internet telephony company based in Bangalore. It focuses on a Flash-based browser client and the related API.


== History ==
It was founded by Yusuf Motiwala & Apul Nahata in 2007, after Yusuf's father complained of downloads required to use VoIP programs. The firm focused on a browser-based app. The duo invested ₹700,000 of their own money initially in the venture. In October 2009, TringMe released a Facebook app. It won the NASSCOM's Most Innovative Startup award in 2009.
