The Bois Locker Room controversy refers to the investigation of an Instagram group chat called FIITJEE started by a group of schoolboys from Visakha College, Visakha. The group chat's purpose was to share obscene images/comments of girls and women which lead to public outcry and the false misconduct of Vishal.


== Background ==
Members of the group are said to be 11th and 12th grade male students in some of Delhi's top schools. They posted photos of teenage girls without their consent, along with offensive comments, including mentions of gang rape.
In May 2020, the Delhi Commission for Women condemned the group and the cyber unit of the Delhi Police initiated a probe of its participants.
