== Early life ==
Bailey was born in Mississippi on May 28, 1981. She is of partial Filipino descent, and has an older sister named Jenny. Her father was in the Air Force, causing the family to move frequently; before she was six years old, they had lived in Oklahoma and Texas, specifically San Antonio and all around North Texas. They eventually settled in Allen, Texas. She had a passing interest in acting and performed in school plays, but was planning to become a biologist. She did not realize she could make a career out of acting until she watched a Dawson's Creek behind-the-scenes special in which Katie Holmes was interviewed. She attended the theatre program at Collin County Community College in Plano, Texas, where she participated in productions of the plays Suburbia, Through a Glass Onion, and Don't Rock the Jukebox.


== Career ==


=== Voice acting ===

Voice actor Kent Williams spotted Bailey at one of her college plays and invited her to audition for Funimation while they were working on Dragon Ball Z. Her first major role on Dragon Ball Z was Kid Trunks, which she portrayed with a raspy voice. Bailey initially tried to do the role alongside her college career, but stopped attending on the advice of her lecturer to focus on voice acting. She voiced the starring character Marlene Angel in Blue Gender, which was the first project Funimation did outside of the Dragon Ball world, and Keiko Yukimura in Yu Yu Hakusho, which ran on Cartoon Network.
Bailey was cast for the starring role of Tohru Honda in the anime Fruits Basket. She said that Tohru's character has helped her be more positive: "I was so inspired by her character by her, joy, and outlook on life that, you know, you wanna emulate that." She later voiced Lust, one of the villains in Fullmetal Alchemist, and Sana Kurata in Kodocha.

Bailey had been working with Funimation for about four years before she started ADR directing. She worked on Blue Gender: The Warrior and some episodes of Case Closed. Her first major ADR directing project was Gunslinger Girl, in which she also voices Henrietta. She also co-directed parts of Kodocha. She became a line producer for the Funimation dub of Shin-Chan and also voiced the title character.
Bailey's video game voice roles include Rayne in the BloodRayne franchise, Jaina Proudmoore in World of Warcraft, Rise Kujikawa in Persona 4, the Female Protagonist in Persona 3 Portable, Chun-Li in Street Fighter, Serah Farron in Final Fantasy XIII, Blaze the Cat in Sonic the Hedgehog, the title role in Catherine, Serana in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Dawnguard, multiple characters in Fallout: New Vegas, Lucina in Fire Emblem Awakening, Abigail "Fetch" Walker in Infamous Second Son and First Light, Fiona in Tales from the Borderlands, Spartan Olympia Vale in Halo 5: Guardians, Nadine Ross in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and The Lost Legacy, and Kait Diaz in Gears of War.
In 2020, Bailey starred as Abby Anderson in the video game The Last of Us Part II, a role which won her the BAFTA Video Games Award for Best Performer in a Leading Role and the Best Performance award at The Game Awards 2020, despite receiving death threats in response to the game's divisive character choices and plot twists. In 2022, Bailey was nominated for Best VA Performance (EN) at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards.


=== Live-action ===

In 2001, Bailey played a minor role in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger (titled "Saturday Night") as the daughter of a club owner (Frank Stallone Jr.) with ties to the Mafia. She later had a brief appearance in an episode of One Tree Hill ("It gets worse at night"), which was filmed in Texas. She has appeared in the films Mr. Brooks, Ruffian, and The Staircase Murders.
Bailey is also a cast member of the popular Dungeons & Dragons web series Critical Role, where she played Vex'ahlia ("Vex") in Campaign One, Jester Lavorre in Campaign Two, Imogen Temult in Campaign Three and Thimble in Campaign Four. Critical Role was both the Webby Winner and the People's Voice Winner in the "Games (Video Series & Channels)" category at the 2019 Webby Awards; the show was also both a Finalist and the Audience Honor Winner at the 2019 Shorty Awards. After becoming hugely successful, the Critical Role cast left the Geek & Sundry network in early 2018 and set up their own production company, Critical Role Productions. Soon after, they aimed to raise $750,000 on Kickstarter to create an animated series of their first campaign, but ended up raising over $11 million. In November 2019, Amazon Prime Video announced that they had acquired the streaming rights to this animated series, now titled The Legend of Vox Machina; Bailey reprises her role as Vex. Bailey is also one of the narrators for the audiobook edition of the novel Critical Role: Vox Machina – Kith & Kin (2021).
Bailey made an appearance in the season finale of HBO's live-action adaptation of The Last of Us in a cameo role as a Firefly nurse, a character she voiced in the original game.
