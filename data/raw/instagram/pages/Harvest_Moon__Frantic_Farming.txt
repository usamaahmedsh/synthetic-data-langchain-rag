== Plot ==
The players compete to gather vegetables to fix a mysterious glowing tower that is causing vegetables to sprout at random all over Sunny Island. The story is told through the point of views of twelve characters: Mark, Chelsea, Vaughn, Pierre, Sabrina, Elliot, Natalie, Shea, Lanna, Julia, Denny, and Witch Princess. In the end, all the crops disappear; Witch Princess's story reveals that she had touched a stone slab that controls the tower, which in turn deactivates it. In the end, a festival is held as a celebration.


== Reception ==

Harvest Moon: Frantic Farming received mainly positive critical reception upon release. Lauren Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report praised the game's puzzle elements, calling the game "immense fun", and while GamePro's Aaron Kohn agreed on the strong puzzle gameplay, he noted the game's unequal distribution in difficulty. Nintendo Power and Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game an 8 out of 10 and 75% respectively. GameZone's Derek Buck concluded that although Harvest Moon: Frantic Farming does not offer much in innovation, the gameplay is where it excels.
