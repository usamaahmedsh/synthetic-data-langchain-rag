Jun Matsumoto (松本 潤, Matsumoto Jun; born August 30, 1983) is a Japanese singer, actor, radio host, and model. He is a member of the boy band Arashi, and is Arashi's concert producer as well as production advisor for other groups. He is best known to Japanese television drama audiences for his portrayal as Tsukasa Dōmyōji in the 2005 television drama series Boys Over Flowers, for which he won GQ Japan's Man of the Year Award under the singer/actor category for his work in the drama.
Matsumoto began his career in the entertainment industry when he joined the Japanese talent agency Johnny & Associates in 1996 at the age of 12. Prior to his debut as a singer with Arashi in 1999, Matsumoto started an acting career when he was cast as Teddy Duchamp for the stage play Stand by Me, which was based on the film of the same name. Since then, he has gone on to appear in numerous dramas and movies, receiving a number of awards and nominations for his roles.


== Early life ==
Matsumoto was born in Toshima, Tokyo, as the youngest child in his family. He has an older sister whose support of KinKi Kids influenced his decision to join Johnny & Associates in 1996. Thinking it might bode good luck, he sent his application to the agency on his elementary school graduation day and received a phone call weeks later from president Johnny Kitagawa himself, inviting him to attend a rehearsal instead of being auditioned. Due to this, Matsumoto is frequently referred to as one of the elite within the agency.
Matsumoto graduated from Horikoshi Gakuen, a renowned high school known for its many performing arts alumnae such as Kyoko Fukada and Ai Kato, in March 2002 at the age of 18.


== Career ==
Matsumoto announced in October 2023 on a fan club video the release of a photo book to celebrate his turning 40. The book included the account of his experience portraying Ieyasu Tokugawa. The book was released in December 2023. On May 31, 2024, the "Oricon First Half 'Book' Ranking" was announced. In the "Men's Photo Books" genre, Matsumoto's book ranked 2nd, after accumulating 66000 units sold in the period.
As with fellow member Ninomiya, Matsumoto announced on May 16, 2024, that he would become independent from Starto in relation to individual activities, but would remain as part of Arashi. Matsumoto left on May 30. On June 1, Matsumoto updated his Instagram account, posting information about his new company, MJC Inc., and giving its website. On the opening page of the website, Matsumoto states the plans of the company: "We focus on creativity and bonding to generate new value,
aiming to lead Japan and the world to a brighter future through entertainment." He is named as "Chief Entertainment Officer".
On December 3, 2024, Matsumoto announced through his official site (MJC.Inc) that he had signed an agent contract with Eternal Moments Inc. for his individual activities, keeping the original site for contracts related to planning, producing and directing.


=== Music career ===

Although the majority of Matsumoto's solos for albums and concerts are written by Arashi's staff, he has contributed lyrics for some of his solos: "La Familia" for the 2004 Arashi! Iza, Now Tour!!, "Naked" in 2008 for the album Dream "A" Live (under the pen name "Jun"), and "Stay Gold" in 2014 for the album The Digitalian. He also supervised the song "DRIVE" in 2016 for the album Are You Happy? and took part in writing lyrics with other Arashi members as Arashi for their songs "Fight Song", "Energy Song - Zekkōchō Chō!!!!", "5×10", and "5×20".
Matsumoto began to be involved in concert production in 2000.  Although he primarily focuses on Arashi concerts, he also gave advice on concert production to younger Johnny & Associates groups, such as for Hey! Say! JUMP in 2014 and King & Prince in 2018; and in 2021 he was director for the Year-End Johnny's Festival Thank you 2021 Hello 2022 concert, featuring many different groups from Johnny & Associates.
 He is officially credited as the director in the closing credits for the concerts Arashi Anniversary Tour 5×20 and Arafes 2020, and on the official website of Johnny's Festival Thank you 2021 Hello 2022 for the concert of the same name. He was named director of Starto Entertainment's all-agency live, set to take place in April 2024. The concert series, named "We Are!! Let's get the party STARTO!!", was co-directed by Matsumoto and Super Eight's Tadayoshi Okura, and would become the last event produced by Matsumoto, before his independence from Starto.
As a concert producer, Matsumoto had also been conceptualizing new ideas. In 2005, he, along with the concert staff team, implemented the usage of the moving stage, which has been subsequently used by several Asian musical acts. 3 years prior to Arashi Live Tour 2014 The Digitalian, Matsumoto had been putting efforts into the idea of utilizing light color changes via bluetooth onto penlights, and the concept was successfully implemented in the previously mentioned concert.


=== Acting career ===


==== Stage ====
In 1997, Matsumoto was cast in his first stage play, which was based on the American coming of age film Stand by Me with future bandmates Masaki Aiba and Kazunari Ninomiya. He did not return to do any major stage productions for nearly seven years after Stand by Me, instead focusing on dramas and movies. However, in 2004, Matsumoto appeared in the stage play West Side Story with bandmates Satoshi Ohno and Sho Sakurai. In 2005 and 2006, Matsumoto was given his first lead stage play roles in Eden no Higashi (エデンの東, East of Eden) and Byakuya no Onna Kishi (白夜の女騎士, Valkyrie of the White Night) respectively.
It was announced on July 21, 2011, that Matsumoto would star in Yukio Ninagawa's production play, Aa, Kōya (あゝ, 荒野, Ah, Wilderness), his first stage play in five years.
On April 16, 2024, it was reported that Matsumoto would appear in Hideki Noda's Noda Map's new play, held from July to November. Noda was not open to appointing talent from the former Johnny's office, the reason being their schedule. "With so many activities, like concerts, variety shows and tv. appearances, I thought they couldn't do the job.", he said in a press conference in 2023. In Matsumoto's case, the opportunity was given thanks to Arashi's hiatus. According to the report, he attended Noda's workshop and prepared for the stage since February. Performances were expected not only in Japan but also in London, England. The play, called Sei sankaku kankei (正三角関係, Trilateral connection), is loosely based on Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. Matsumoto, who shared the stage with Masami Nagasawa, and Eita Nagayama, plays the eldest of the Karamatsu brothers, a pyrotechnic artist, in a suspense story that deals with the "incident" of the murder of their father. The play had performances in Tokyo, at the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre, in Kitakyushu and Osaka, as well as Sadler's Wells Theatre in London, under the name of "Love in action", running from July 11 until November 2.
