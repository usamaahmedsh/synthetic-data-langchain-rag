Tyler Knott Gregson is a poet, author, essayist, and professional photographer based in Helena, Montana. Gregson has accrued fame as a poet on social media platforms such as Tumblr, Instagram and Twitter since 2009. He writes and posts a bi-weekly newsletter, Signal Fire, filled with essays, poetry, and photography, and continues to publish poetry anthologies.


== Background ==
Gregson studied sociology and criminology at the University of Montana. He worked as a freelance writer for various companies, and began blogging on his own in 2009. He says he has written poetry since being in middle school.


== Typewriter Series and career ==
The "Typewriter Series" was born in 2012 when Gregson found an old typewriter in a Helena antique store and typed out a poem spontaneously.  He said, "I just did it all at once and it was like stream of consciousness, I didn't plan it or think it through—I just let it go."  The poet now challenges himself to post one of these every single day.
Gregson's main incentive for writing is to express that poetry is not dead and is something to be valued. Writing about various themes like love, hope, sadness, and wanderlust, has enabled his readers to relate their own experiences to his words. Gregson has enticed readers by inspiring them to view the world in a different light. To continue making a difference with his writing, Gregson donated $2 of the sales for every pre-ordered book of Chasers of the Light to the To Write Love on Her Arms (TWLOHA) suicide prevention organization. The author has ranked a huge social media following, consisting of 328,000 followers on Tumblr and 357,000 on Instagram These followers are rapidly increasing as fellow celebrities have noticed his work and are mentioning him to their own followers. Singer-songwriter Christina Perri has encouraged fans to check out Gregson's work which has provided him more exposure in the social media realm.
