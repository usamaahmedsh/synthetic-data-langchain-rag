Miss Puerto Rico is a national title bestowed on the women representing the archipelago and island of Puerto Rico in international beauty pageants.
Although an American territory, Puerto Rico participates in international sports competitions and beauty pageants under the flag of Puerto Rico as an entity separate from the United States. As in the Olympic Games since 1948 and the Pan American Games since 1955, it has competed independently in beauty pageants since 1952, when its representative debuted in Miss Universe as Miss Puerto Rico.
In 1987, Puerto Rico became the ninth nation to win Miss Universe, Miss World and Miss International, the three oldest pageants. In 2019, it won Miss Earth, becoming the fourth nation to win the major Big Four pageants aforementioned. In 2019, having previously won Miss Supranational and Miss Grand International, the contests constituting the six major Grand Slam pageants together with the Big Four,  it also became the first nation to win all said pageants. When Miss Intercontinental, the oldest minor pageant, is included, Puerto Rico is also the first nation to win all said seven pageants.
With 17 combined wins in the aforementioned groups of contests as of 2024, Puerto Rico is considered a powerhouse in the industry of beauty pageants. It is the fourth nation globally with the most combined wins in these groups except in the Grand Slam, where it is the fifth nation globally. It is also the second Ibero-American nation with the most combined wins in these groups.
Beauty pageants are a part of the culture of Puerto Rico. The businesswoman in the modeling and beauty industry in charge of many Puerto Rican representatives competing internationally between 1952 and 1998, Anna Santisteban, popularly known as the Hacedora de Reinas (Maker of Queens), is often recognized as the most influential promoter of pageants in the archipelago. As the holder of the Miss Universe franchise in Puerto Rico, Santisteban produced three international winners: 1970, 1985, and 1993.

The winner is crowned at the conclusion of the final competition.

Miss Intercontinental was held twice in 1991. Carmen Lynda Díaz from Puerto Rico won the first edition held in Lagos, Nigeria by Nigerian owners of the pageant, Silverbird Productions, which held the franchise from 1986 to 1991, and Elena Ivanova from Russia won the second edition held in Bonn, Germany by organizers working under the direction of the new owners of the pageant, a company from Germany, which held the competition in Europe from 1991 to 2003. Despite not being included in the official archive of the pageant by the current owners, Puerto Rico irrefutably won the first edition of 1991 in Nigeria, thus achieving its second Miss Intercontinental crown.
Having produced five winners as of 2024, Puerto Rico is the country with the most crowns, along Venezuela and United States, which have 5 winners each.
Since it began to be awarded in 2008, Puerto Rico is the country with the most Miss North America titles, winning it seven times as of 2024.
