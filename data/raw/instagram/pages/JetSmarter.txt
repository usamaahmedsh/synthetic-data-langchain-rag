JetSmarter was a corporation and mobile application for private jet users. The company was headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States. The app connected users to available aircraft and routes in the United States, Europe and Middle East. The company was purchased by Vista Global in 2019 and merged into a new brand, XO.


== History ==
JetSmarter was founded in 2012 by entrepreneur Sergey Petrossov, whose idea made him one of Forbes' "30 Under 30" business leaders of 2016. In August 2012, the beta version was launched and tested among a closed group of private aviation users. After testing proved successful, Petrossov sought and received substantial venture funding to expand JetSmarter's scope. In March 2013, the JetSmarter app was launched and made available to the general public on both iOS and Android devices.
In June 2015, JetSmarter announced its new European headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. In early 2016, it launched flights within Europe. JetSmarter had offices in Zurich, London, Moscow, Dubai, Riyadh, and Fort Lauderdale.
On April 10, 2019, Dubai-based Vista Global said it had made an agreement to acquire JetSmarter adding it to its aviation portfolio, which includes VistaJet and XOJET. Vista said it would maintain JetSmarter's office in Ft. Lauderdale where its digital team was based.
On June 27, 2019, Vista Global announced it had combined JetSmarter with its XOJET subsidiary rebranding the combined entity as XO, powered by JetSmarter technology.
