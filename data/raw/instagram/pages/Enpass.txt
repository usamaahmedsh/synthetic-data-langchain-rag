Enpass is a freemium password manager and passkey manager available for MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android and Linux, with browser extensions for all major browsers, and pricing plans for both personal use and business.


== Functionalities ==
It features:

Multiple vaults
Password generation
Biometric authentication
Form filling for all supported platforms
Integrated software keyboard for form filling on Android devices
Generation of time-based one-time passwords for online services
The Password Checkup tool uses zxcvbn to assess password strength.
It detects credential breaches by querying the Have I Been Pwned? database.
Privacy: The application features client-side encryption, using SQLCipher to encrypt its keychain file locally with a user-defined master password. The Enpass app retains no user data on its company servers, instead storing and syncing encrypted password vaults on storage controlled by the end user.
Synchronisation: Enpass vaults are usually stored on users' own cloud storage service like Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud. Enpass also supports self-hosted WebDAV solutions such as ownCloud and Nextcloud, as well as on browsers, plus offline synchronisation.


== Availability ==
Enpass provides multiple client applications, including desktop applications, browser extensions and mobile apps. The desktop apps are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, while browser extensions are offered for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi and Brave. Mobile apps are available for Android and iOS.
Enpass products include Personal and Family editions that feature vault sharing via personal cloud accounts, and Business and Enterprise editions with users’ vaults stored within each clients’ business-cloud infrastructure. For personal and family users, the desktop app is free, and the mobile app is free up to 25 records, with more records and additional features available with a software subscription. The Business and Enterprise editions are billed per user, per month, and include security audits, access recovery, and password-less vault sharing between invited co-workers.


== Security Criticism ==


=== 2024 Evaluation of Password Checkup Tools ===
A 2024 study by Hutchinson et al. examined the “password checkup” features of 14 password managers, including Enpass, using weak, breached, and randomly generated passwords. The authors found that the evaluated products reported weak and compromised passwords inconsistently and sometimes incompletely. No manager successfully flagged all known breached passwords. The study concludes that such inconsistencies may give users a false sense of security.


=== 2025 DOM-based Extension Clickjacking ===
Security researcher Marek Tóth presented a vulnerability in browser extensions of several password managers (including Enpass) at DEF CON 33 on August 9, 2025. In their default configurations, these extensions were shown to be exposed to a DOM-based extension clickjacking technique, allowing attackers to exfiltrate user data with just a single click. The affected password manager vendors were notified in April 2025. According to Tóth, Dashlane version 6.11.6 (August 13, 2025) addressed the issue.
