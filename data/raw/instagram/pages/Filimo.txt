In August 2019, Sabaidea launched the "Filimo Box", a hardware device designed to enhance users' streaming experience. This Android-based box features 2 GB of DDR4 RAM and 16 GB of internal storage.

Filimo launched Televika, a streaming service designed for audiences outside Iran, offering films and television series from Western Asia. The platform provides a collection of content that reflects the region's diverse cultures, histories, and contemporary stories, accessible with subtitles in English, Kurdish, and Arabic. Televika features a range of genres, including historical dramas, modern narratives, documentaries, and family-oriented entertainment.

This broadens the platform's reach and makes it an accessible option for a global audience interested in exploring Western Asian cinema and television.
