=== Pre-draft ===

Before the 2003 NFL draft, Adams participated in the Senior Bowl. Representing the North alongside four of his Penn State teammates, his team won 17–0.


=== San Francisco 49ers ===
The San Francisco 49ers selected Adams in the second round (57th overall) of the 2003 NFL draft; the 49ers, who lost two starting defensive linemen during the offseason, drafted Adams and defensive end Andrew Williams in the following round to fill the gap.

Adams became a free agent after the 2006 season, ending his 49ers tenure with 155 tackles and six sacks in 58 games.


=== Chicago Bears ===
On March 25, 2007, he signed a four-year contract with the Chicago Bears; team writer Larry Mayer described Adams as "an undersized but quick tackle who seemingly is an ideal fit for the Bears' one-gap defense." In 2010, he started all 16 games and the Bears' playoff games; at season's end, he was named a Brian Piccolo Award recipient. The following season, he only started four games and appeared in 11, and was released on February 26, 2012.
He announced his retirement via YouTube on March 24, 2013. In nine seasons, he served primarily as a depth player, starting at least eight games in three years. He ended his career with 278 tackles and 10.5 sacks.
