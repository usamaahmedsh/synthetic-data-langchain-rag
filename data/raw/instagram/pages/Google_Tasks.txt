Google Tasks is a task management application developed by Google and included with Google Workspace. 
Included initially as a feature in Gmail and Google Calendar, Google Tasks launched as a core product with a standalone app in 2018. It is available for Android and iOS, as well as in the right-hand side panel on Google Workspace apps on the web and in Google Calendar.

Google Tasks began as an integration within other apps in G Suite (now Google Workspace), allowing to-do items to be created in Calendar and Gmail. Upon graduating to a core service on June 28, 2018, Google Tasks launched as a dedicated mobile app in which tasks can be sorted into lists, managed, and completed. Google Tasks launched the ability to create tasks from Google Chat messages in 2022.
