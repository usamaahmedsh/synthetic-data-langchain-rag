== History ==


=== Early independent releases (2000–2003) ===
In 2000, Dunn, Clark, and Paige founded a Peterborough-based group called "SWISH", while Biro sang lead vocals for a four-piece group called the "Cheese Monkeys from Planet Nine" from Barrie, Ontario. In 2000, SWISH released their first independent album, Riding Around the Park on Mime Radio, an independent record label based in Peterborough. In January 2002, Biro moved to Peterborough to join Dunn, Clark, and Paige and SWISH was renamed "Reason Being", before finally settling with the name "Hawk Nelson". In 2003, they released their second independent album, Saturday Rock Action.


=== Letters to the President (2004–2005) ===
They continued to perform and tour independently in Ontario, Canada, before being signed with Tooth & Nail Records, largely on the recommendation of Trevor McNevan, the lead singer of fellow Tooth & Nail bands Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static. McNevan, also from Peterborough, Ontario, is credited with discovering the band. In July 2004, Hawk Nelson released their debut album Letters to the President. It was produced by Aaron Sprinkle and McNevan, who also co-wrote the album's fourteen songs. He has also appeared on some of the band's songs, as well as in their video for the song "California".
Popular with Christian rock fans, the band has achieved some success in the mainstream as well. They portrayed The Who on an episode of the NBC drama American Dreams, and they recorded a song named "Bring 'Em Out" as the theme for the 2005 motion picture Yours, Mine and Ours featuring Drake Bell. This song and another hit song "The Show" were both used on Sunday Night Football commercials. "Things We Go Through" from Letters to the President was also featured in Yours, Mine and Ours. 
In October 2005, the band re-released Letters to the President, with new material including their cover of The Who's "My Generation", three acoustic versions of some of their hits, and a limited edition cover. Hawk Nelson plays the party band for the film Yours, Mine and Ours (2005). On December 20, 2005, Hawk Nelson released an extended play titled Bring 'Em Out.


=== Smile, It's the End of the World (2006–2007) ===

On April 4, 2006, Hawk Nelson released Connect Sets with six acoustic tracks, including "Bring Em' Out", "Thing We Go Through", and "California".
The band released their second studio album, Smile, It's the End of the World, on April 4, 2006. The album was also co-written by Trevor McNevan of Thousand Foot Krutch. The album won a GMA Canada Covenant Award for "Modern Rock/Alternative Album of the Year" in 2006. The album's first single, "Everything You Ever Wanted", went on to hit No. 1 for 9 weeks on the R&R Christian CHR chart, and was the fourth most-played song of 2006. The band spent the middle of 2006 touring the major Christian music festivals, and also took part in Jeremy Camp's Beyond Measure tour. Hawk Nelson released a three-track Christmas extended play titled Gloria on November 21, 2006, and then toured with TobyMac's Winter Wonder Slam tour along with The Afters, Family Force 5, and Ayiesha Woods.

=== Post-Dunn releases, Steingard's renouncement of faith and departure (2012–2020) ===

After Dunn's departure from the band, Steingard replacing him on vocals marked a shift in the band's genre from fast-paced pop punk to softer, contemporary alternative and pop rock.

"Just Getting Started", another song from Diamonds, was heard in several American Idol promo spots ahead of the album's release. The album was released on iTunes and other major music websites on March 17, 2015.
On December 15, 2017, the band released the single, "He Still Does (Miracles)", as part of a new album, Miracles, which was released April 6, 2018, through Fair Trade Services.
In May 2020, Steingard announced on his Instagram page that he had lost his faith in God and was no longer a Christian.
