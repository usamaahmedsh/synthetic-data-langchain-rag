=== 78. Odiorne's Point ===

An Instagram post and photo by the Indigenous New Hampshire Collaborative Collective shows that the text on this marker has been revised since originally installed—the current marker reads:
"This seaside place is located on N'dakinna, the traditional homeland of the Abenaki, Pennacook, and Wabanaki Peoples past and present. In 1623, David Thompson settled here to fish, farm, and trade under a grant from the British Council for New England, displacing the Native peoples. John Odiorne settle here ca. 1660 and his descendants farmed the property until 1942, when the federal government took the land to construct Fort Dearborn as a coastal defense. The fort was decommissioned after World War II and in 1972 the site was designated for recreation and dedicated as Odiorne Point State Park."
Original marker text:
"Here, in the spring of 1623, was established New Hampshire's first settlement, Pannaway Plantation. David Thompson and other hardy fishermen came from England to colonize and develop trade.
