== Power Rangers casting criticism ==
In the Investigation Discovery series Hollywood Demons, Oliver said it was a "mistake" to cast an Asian actress to play the Yellow Ranger and a Black actor to play the Black Ranger in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. When the casting was originally done, Oliver said that "none of us [were] thinking stereotypes". However, Walter Emanuel Jones, who played the Black Ranger, responded by defending the casting decision of that character. He wrote on Instagram, "I understand the impulse to address what might be seen as cultural insensitivity, but calling it a 'mistake' would dismiss the impact it had on countless people around the world who found inspiration and representation in TV's first Black superhero — morphin' into none other than the Black Power Ranger! It wasn't a mistake; it was a milestone. It was an honor."
