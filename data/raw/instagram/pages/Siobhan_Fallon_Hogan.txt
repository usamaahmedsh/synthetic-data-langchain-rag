Her television work includes Saturday Night Live (1991–1992), Seinfeld (1991–1994), and Wayward Pines (2015–2016).


== Early life ==
Hogan was born in Syracuse, New York, the daughter of Jane (née Eagan) and William J. Fallon, an attorney. She was raised Catholic, and is of Irish descent. Hogan grew up in Cazenovia, New York and graduated from Cazenovia High School in 1979. She graduated from Le Moyne College in 1983, earning her Masters in Fine Arts from The Catholic University of America two years later.


== Career ==
After starting out in television with guest parts on The Golden Girls and Seinfeld, as well as a regular position on Saturday Night Live between 1991 and 1992, Hogan made her feature film debut in 1994 with a small but memorable appearance in Forrest Gump. Subsequent projects included supporting roles in Striptease (1996), Fools Rush In (1997), Men in Black (1997), and The Negotiator (1998). 
Hogan made the move into more serious film work when she was cast as Brenda, a sympathetic prison guard, in Lars von Trier's critically divisive 2000 musical tragedy, Dancer in the Dark: "I guess I was pegged for awhile [as] a comedic character actress, and [von Trier, being European] didn't know that I was — so he gave me a shot at playing a really serious role". She also featured on the film's soundtrack, duetting with co-star Björk on the track "107 Steps". Hogan then re-teamed with von Trier to play Martha, a seemingly kind villager whose capacity for cruelty is gradually unleashed, in the experimental drama Dogville (2003). That same year, she took on supporting parts in the financially successful comedies Holes and Daddy Day Care. Hogan continued to work in a variety of films throughout the decade, including the children's fantasy Charlotte's Web (2006) and the rom-coms Fever Pitch (2005), Baby Mama (2008), and New in Town (2009). She also appeared as Betsy, an affluent neighbour, in Michael Haneke's darkly satirical Funny Games (2007); an American remake of his Austrian film of the same name.
Following parts in The Bounty Hunter (2010), We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011), Going in Style (2017), and The House That Jack Built (2018; her third collaboration with Lars von Trier)—as well as her recurring portrayal of Arlene Moran, a sheriff's office receptionist, on two seasons of the Fox sci-fi mystery series Wayward Pines (2015–2016)—Hogan made her screenwriting debut with the 2021 thriller, Rushed, in which she also starred as a distraught mother grieving the death of her teenage son. Co-produced by von Trier's Zentropa, it was released through Vertical Entertainment to positive reviews, with Hogan's portrayal of Barbara receiving particular praise. In her review for The Guardian, critic Leslie Felperin stated:

Few actors would have been able to pull this off like Hogan, who is not only the star but also the film's screenwriter and producer. She's one of those "who-is-that-again?" character actors you've seen hundreds of times before in all sorts of films [...] she is ordinary looking but also radiant, a force of nature in a fringed buckskin coat. [The director] just rolls with it and lets Hogan steer the ship.
Hogan's next screenplay credit was Shelter in Solitude (2023), a comedy-drama set during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Writing for Film Threat, Perry Norton called it "a charming indie film [with] guts", while Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com commended Hogan's script for being "more interested in character than formula", adding that her lead portrayal of Valerie, an ex-country singer who befriends a death row prisoner, was filled with "depth and sensitivity". That same year, Hogan appeared in the psychological thriller Eileen, with Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson believing her portrayal of a strict prison secretary to be one of the film's strengths, writing,  "[she] practically walks off with the movie after a mere few line readings".


== Acting style ==
Hogan has said that she embraces her label as a character actress, and finds playing eccentric roles "so much more interesting [and] fun". Reflecting on being typecast in 2013, she admitted to often playing people who are "blue-collar, maybe a hick (or) dirtbag", but that she didn't mind because "I love playing that stuff".


== Personal life ==
Hogan is a member of the Atlantic Theater Company. She was once a resident of Middletown Township, New Jersey, and has a summer home in Cazenovia, New York. A resident of Rumson, New Jersey since 2005, she married commodities trader Peter Hogan in 1992, with whom she has three children: Bernadette, Peter, and Sinead.
Hogan is a practicing Catholic. She has admitted to rejecting roles that do not align with her beliefs, saying in 2013, "If I find [the material] to be immoral, or it doesn't sit right with me [then] I'm like, 'I'm not doing this' [...] My faith has cost me a lot of money".
