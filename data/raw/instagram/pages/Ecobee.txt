ecobee is a Toronto, Canada-based home automation company that makes smart thermostats, temperature, and occupancy sensors, smart light switches, smart cameras, and contact sensors. They were acquired by the American company Generac Holdings in 2021.
The thermostats are controlled by using the built-in touchscreen, web portal, or app available for iOS, Android, and the Apple Watch. Other devices are controlled solely through the app or web portal.
The thermostat or camera acts as a smart home hub for their other devices. The light switches do not require a thermostat or camera but do not provide hub functionality.
ecobee provides a set of subscription services.
