"Angels" is a song by the English singer Robbie Williams. It was included on Williams's debut solo album, Life thru a Lens (1997), and released as a single on 1 December 1997 by Chrysalis. It was produced by Guy Chambers and Steve Power.
The Irish singer-songwriter Ray Heffernan asserts that he wrote the first version of "Angels" in 1996 and finished it with Williams. Williams confirmed that he recorded a demo with Heffernan but said he rewrote it significantly with Chambers. To avoid a lawsuit, Williams bought the song rights from Heffernan before it was released. He has never confirmed that Heffernan wrote it.
"Angels" reached number four on the UK singles chart and number 53 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. As of 2014, it had sold more than 1.16 million copies in the UK. It won the 1999 Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically and was voted the best song of the previous 25 years at the 2005 Brit Awards. In 2005, Britons voted it the song they most wanted played at their funeral. 
"Angels" has been covered by artists including Jessica Simpson, David Archuleta, Beverley Knight, All Angels, Declan Galbraith and Josh Groban. It was recorded in Spanish (as "Ángel") by the Mexican singers Yuridia and Marco Moré, in Italian (as "Un Angelo") by Patrizio Buanne and in Brazilian Portuguese (as "Um Anjo") by KLB. Williams also recorded a Spanish version.


== Authorship ==
Robbie Williams said he wrote "Angels" with his collaborator Guy Chambers in 25 minutes. By his account, he and Chambers were sitting outside a café watching a water fountain, which inspired them to write the chorus. In 2016, Williams said: "It was the first of our songs that we wrote together. We could tell and hoped and prayed that we got something incredibly special." He expressed irritation that some assumed Chambers was the sole author. Chambers said he wrote the music, and Williams the lyrics and melody: "It was very equal. Rob knew exactly what he wanted to say, and how he wanted to say it."
According to the Irish singer-songwriter Ray Heffernan, "Angels" was based on an earlier song written by him. Heffernan says he met Williams in a pub by chance in Dublin in 1996, and played him an incomplete version comprising the first verse, some of the chorus and some of the second verse. That week, the two recorded a studio demo. Williams confirmed that he had recorded a demo with Heffernan but said he rewrote the song significantly with Chambers. He has never confirmed that Heffernan wrote the song, calling him a "fantasist". Heffernan believes that Williams was seeking recognition as a songwriter at the time, and to have credited Heffernan would have damaged Williams's credibility. 
Before the song's release, Heffernan accepted an offer from Williams to buy the rights. According to Heffernan, he was initially offered £2,500, which rose to £7,500 when he asked for a writing credit. He said: "I was mostly thrilled. That’s what you're supposed to do, right? Sell your songs to pop stars." He is thanked in the UK CD2 single liner notes. Williams said: "We could have gone to court, and it all would have been down to whether what way the judge wakes up that day out of bed ... So I gave him some money, and he went away."
In 2011, Heffernan said was once angry about the situation but that "Angels" had earned him connections with publishing companies. In 2023, he said he did not regret earning no royalties, as this would have enabled his destructive use of drugs at the time. However, he was hurt that Williams had never acknowledged his authorship and that he had accepted an Ivor Novello Award for writing "Angels" in 1999. He said: "That's what the young kid in me really wants — acknowledgement. It's not about the millions." As of 2023, Heffernan was working as a language teacher in rural Italy.
According to Heffernan, in September 2024, he privately sent Williams a hand-written letter to his Instagram account. The following day, Williams made a public post reading "Look, I did answer / I answered by not answering", which Heffernan interpreted as a cryptic response. In August 2025, Heffernan said he planned to pursue legal action under a new part of EU copyright law that allows creators to seek retrospective compensation for successful works. Heffernan is seeking around a third of future royalties.


== Sales ==
"Angels" was released as the fourth single from Williams's debut album, Life Thru a Lens (1997). The music video was directed by Vaughan Arnell. Though "Angels" only reached number 4 on the UK singles chart, it was a consistent seller. It spent a total of 12 weeks in the top 10 and 17 weeks in the top 75. In the UK, it was the 38th-bestselling single of 1997, the 25th-bestselling of 1998 and the 34th-bestselling single of the decade. As of 2014, it had sold more than 1.16 million copies in the UK.  
In the US, "Angels" was released in 1999 after Williams' debut there with his single "Millennium". It reached number 53, becoming his highest-charting US single. "Angels" re-entered the ARIA Top 100 at No. 91, on 5 May 2008. In 2022, Williams released a reworked version, "Angels (XXV)", from his compilation album XXV. It reached number 92 on the UK singles chart on 10 June.


== Reception ==
Aberdeen Press and Journal said "Angels" was "perhaps the strongest cut" from the Life thru a Lens album. John Bush from AllMusic noted Williams' "crooning". Larry Flick of Billboard described it as a "sweet ballad that never gets sappy". He noted that the production is "first-rate, the lyric is thoughtful and ear-grabbing, and his smoky, crisp vocal is a sheer delight. All that and a chorus to kill for." An editor for Daily Record felt Williams had "come of age with this melodic pop ballad" and complimented a "surprisingly grown-up sounding Robbie on what is his best tune to date". The Irish Independent called it an "epic ballad".
Music & Media wrote: "With songs of the quality of 'Angels', Robbie Williams is on his way towards extending his audience by drawing in older listeners ... [It] distinguishes itself from its indie rock-inspired predecessors 'Old Before I Die' and 'Lazy Days' by exchanging their guitars for a more mellow, piano-based arrangement." Music Week gave "Angels" four out of five, likening it to Elton John and saying it suggested that Williams would be more successful than his former Take That bandmate Gary Barlow. The Pitchfork writer Michael Sandlin called it a "pink feather-boa'd Elton John mishap" with a guitar imitating George Harrison.
In 2017, Dave Fawbert from ShortList declared "Angels" "genuinely brilliant", with "a pretty understated vocal from Robbie. Nothing too over the top, just sincere." The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis wrote in 2022 that "Angels" was "so ubiquitous for so long that it is almost impossible for anyone of a certain age to listen to it objectively: throughout the late 90s and 00s, it wasn't so much a song as an unavoidable fact of daily life. Most pop songwriters would kill to come up with something with such impact and longevity." In 2025, the Guardian writer Ian Gittins described "Angels" as "the ubiquitous national anthem of the 90s". 
"Angels" won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically in 1999. In 2003, Q named it the 237th-best song of all time. In a 2004 poll of almost 30,000 people by VH1, "Angels" was voted the best single that never reached number one. At the 2005 Brit Awards, where Williams performed it with Joss Stone, the British public voted "Angels" the best British song of the past 25 years. In a 2005 survey of more than 45,000 people by Music Choice, Britons chose "Angels" as the song they would most like played at their funeral.

=== Jessica Simpson ===

Jessica Simpson's cover of "Angels" was the fourth and final single released from her album In This Skin in 2004. It was produced by Billy Mann.


==== Music video ====
The video for "Angels" opens a visibly anxious Simpson on an empty stage rehearsing for a performance. She can be seen in intercut scenes staring into space, as if she has lost her self-confidence and ability to perform. As the song progresses, however, white roses can be seen scattered around her as a sign of hope, and soon Simpson begins to regain her confidence. The song then shifts into its instrumental bridge to correlate with the emotions of the characters, as Simpson proceeds to climb to the top of the building for her final performance. There she is greeted by a youth orchestra, and finishes the song.


==== Chart performance ====
Simpson's version of "Angels" failed to break into the Billboard Hot 100 (though it did reach number six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles). However, the song did become a moderate success on the Top 40 Mainstream and Hot Digital Tracks charts.
