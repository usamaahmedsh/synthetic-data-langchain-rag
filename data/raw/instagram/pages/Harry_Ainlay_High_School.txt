== Building ==
The engineers at Harry Ainlay High School were T. H. Newton Engineering Ltd., and the architect was Donald Bittorf of the firm of Annett and Bittorf. The building was constructed in 1965. A notable element of the design of the school is the unusual lack of windows. This design feature has led to a local myth that the school was a repurposed bomb shelter.
"The school has several classrooms, science labs, a library, computer rooms, music room, industrial shops, two gymnasiums, an auditorium, a cafeteria, and several administrative areas."


== Canadian Student Leadership Conference ==
From 25–28 September 2018, the school hosted the Canadian Student Leadership Conference 2018. Speakers such as Chris Hadfield, Michel Chikwanine (a child soldier), Keith Hawkins, and Phil Boyte attended.

=== International Baccalaureate Program ===
Harry Ainlay was the second school in Alberta to introduce the International Baccalaureate program and is one of eight schools in the Edmonton Public School System offering an International Baccalaureate diploma program.
