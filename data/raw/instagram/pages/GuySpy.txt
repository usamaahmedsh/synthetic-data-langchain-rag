== Controversies ==
GuySpy has run into difficulties with Facebook's Community Standards several times. In 2012 their Facebook page was blocked for over 30 days, and later they posted an image of a nude man and it was taken down within few hours. GuySpy has challenged Facebook's community standards, considering them to be homophobic as they allowed similar images that showed women.
The app's 2013 billboard campaign in Vancouver received complaints. The complainant alleged that the advertisement offended standards of public decency. The ad was showing two men, one sitting on the other's back with the phrase "Taste the difference" According to the council's opinion the words crossed the line of the acceptability of Clause 14.
