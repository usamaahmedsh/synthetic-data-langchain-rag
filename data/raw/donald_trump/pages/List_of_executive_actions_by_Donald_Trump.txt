The president of the United States may take any of several kinds of executive actions. 
Executive orders are issued to help officers and agencies of the executive branch manage the operations within the federal government itself. Presidential memoranda are closely related, and have the force of law on the Executive Branch, but are generally considered less prestigious. Presidential memoranda do not have an established process for issuance, and unlike executive orders, they are not numbered. A presidential determination results in an official policy or position of the executive branch of the United States government. A presidential proclamation is a statement issued by a president on a matter of public policy, under specific authority granted to the president by Congress, typically on a matter of widespread interest. Administrative orders are signed documents such as notices, letters, and orders, that can be issued to conduct administrative operations of the federal government. A presidential notice or a presidential sequestration order can also be issued. National security directives operate like executive orders, but are only in the area of national security. They have been issued by different presidents under various names.

=== Discrepancies between White House versions and Federal Register versions ===
In February 2017, a review of presidential documents by USA Today showed that the White House posted inaccurate texts of Trump's executive orders on its website, conflicting with the official versions published in the Federal Register. Most of the differences were minor grammatical or typographic changes, but there were "two cases where the original text referred to inaccurate or non-existent provisions of law."  This raised concerns among advocates for government transparency; the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation said that the "last-minute edits" to the orders indicated problems with the Trump administration's "vetting, sign-off, and publication processes for executive orders."  The inaccuracies also prompted concern because the Federal Register versions of presidential documents are often published several days after they are signed, "meaning that the public must often rely on what the White House puts out." In the order on ethics guidelines for federal appointees, the WhiteHouse.gov section cites "section 207 of title 28, United States Code," which ProPublica found does not exist. The correct citation, made in the Federal Register version, is section 207 of title 18. Presidential determination no. 11 (Respect to the Efforts of Foreign Governments Regarding Trafficking in Persons) is not on whitehouse.gov,40 however, it is in the Federal Register.
