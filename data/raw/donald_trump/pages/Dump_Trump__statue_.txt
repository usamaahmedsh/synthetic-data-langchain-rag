== Description and history ==

In addition to depicting Donald Trump tweeting from a smartphone on a golden toilet while wearing a MAGA hat with "IMPEACH ME!" scribbled on it, the 16-foot (4.9 m) statue makes flatulence noises and says the phrases "I'm a very stable genius", "no collusion", "witch-hunt", and "you are fake news". The statue was designed by dinosaur expert and author Don Lessem and cost approximately $25,000. "I'm interested in things that are big, not very intelligent and have lost their place in history", the artist commented.
The statue was temporarily installed in Central London's Trafalgar Square ahead of his 2019 visit to the United Kingdom. It was displayed during the Trump-organised Salute to America event in Washington, D.C., on 4 July 2019.
