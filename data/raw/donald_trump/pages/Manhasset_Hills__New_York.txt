== History ==
By the late 1950s, much of the land in Manhasset Hills had been developed by developers. One of the last major developments to be built was the Cherrywood Homes development, which was built on a 24-acre tract by Barney and Martin Spiegel. The development was built with 88 split-level houses designed by A.H. Salkowitz, and was constructed on one of the last remaining major undeveloped tracts of land available in Manhasset Hills.
In the 1980s and 1990s, roughly 1,000 Manhasset Hills residents attempted to prevent the State of New York from placing a group home in their neighborhood for people with mental disabilities. Many were concerned that their property values would decrease because of the group home's presence, and attempted to change a law in order to prevent the home from being established. The residents were successful in preventing the group home from being established in their community, and the home was instead established in nearby New Hyde Park.
The Long Island Motor Parkway used to run along the northern border of the hamlet.
