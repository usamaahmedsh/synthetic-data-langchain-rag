As of 2014, Lunden is a special correspondent for NBC's Today. In 2021, Lunden became host of the public television program Second Opinion.


== Early life and education ==
Joan Elise Blunden was born in Sacramento County, California, the daughter of Gladyce Lorraine (née Somervill) and Dr. Erle Murray Blunden. Her father was the chief of staff at American River Hospital and an amateur pilot with his own airport. She had a brother 8 months older than her named Jeff.
In 1964, her father and Dr. Byron E. Hall, a San Francisco physician, died in a plane crash in Malibu Canyon, California. They were returning from an American Cancer Society state board of directors meeting in Los Angeles.
Blunden graduated from Bella Vista High School in Fair Oaks, California at the age of 16 in 1967. She earned a Liberal Arts degree from California State University, Sacramento. Later she studied Spanish and anthropology at the former Mexico City campus of Universidad de Las Americas. She was a visiting instructor at Montclair State College in New Jersey, where she taught a course in broadcast journalism.


== Career ==
In 1973, she began her broadcasting career working as a trainee at (Channel 3) KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California. Within two years she was the co-anchor of the daily noon television news program. She produced the noon news broadcast and hosted KCRA's television specials.


=== Good Morning America ===
In 1975, Blunden moved to New York City and she found an apartment with the help of her childhood friend Jed Johnson and his longtime partner Andy Warhol. That year, she joined New York's WABC-TV Eyewitness News, at which time her name was changed to avoid being called "Blunder". A year later, she became co-anchor on the weekend newscasts. Lunden joined GMA in the fall of 1976 as a feature news/consumer reporter, and later became fill-in co-host when former co-host Sandy Hill left to work on ABC's coverage of the 1976 Winter Olympics.
Her popularity led to her quick promotion to co-host with David Hartman, the program's original host, in 1980. Later, she would spend the majority of her career hosting with ABC's Charlie Gibson. She reported from 26 countries, covered four presidents, five Olympic Games, and two royal weddings. Her popularity on the GMA program from the 1970s through the 1990s allowed her to interview U.S. Presidents and First Ladies Gerald and Betty Ford, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, George and Barbara Bush, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and also Texas Governor George W. Bush and Laura Bush prior to his election as president in 2000.
As the co-host of GMA, Lunden traveled the world, covering historic events, such as the 50th anniversary of VE Day (Victory in Europe) in 1995; the 50th anniversary of D-Day; the 1984 and 1988 Winter Olympic Games in Sarajevo and Calgary, respectively; and the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales. She covered the administrations and inaugurations of three presidents —Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. She was one of only three American journalists to interview Prince Charles during his 1983 visit to the United States.
Lunden was known for her willingness to take risks in her role as host. She climbed and rappelled Alaska's famed Mendenhall Glacier and bungee-jumped off a 143-foot bridge and paraglided off a 2,000-foot mountain during the program's highly rated trip to New Zealand. She navigated the whitewater rapids of a Georgia river for a GMA show in 1994.
While reporting on the TWA Flight 800 crash in 1996, Lunden spoke of her friendship with Jed Johnson who was a victim aboard the plane. She shared a photo of Johnson and his partner Alan Wanzenberg, and expressed her condolences. She referred to Wanzenberg as his domestic partner, which drew praise from Alan Klein, a spokesperson for Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation because Wanzenberg had been referred to as Johnson's "business partner" in initial reports. Klein said Lunden's actions were "life affirming" and partners of lesbians and gays are often ignored in news accounts of tragedies.
Lunden left GMA after 17 years as co-host with her last day being on September 5, 1997.


=== Hosting and other work ===
Lunden was a host on the A&E cable network program Behind Closed Doors (originally aired on ABC as occasional primetime specials; 1996–2001), an on-location, undercover reporter program.

In 2014, Lunden returned to morning television as a special correspondent for NBC's Today.

Lunden also hosts Health Corner, a Lifetime series sponsored by Walgreens. She is currently the spokesperson for A Place for Mom, a national senior care referral service.

== Personal life ==
Lunden was a close friend of interior designer Jed Johnson. They met when she was in the fourth grade in Fair Oaks and he was her first boyfriend.
Lunden was married to Michael A. Krauss from 1978 until their divorce in 1992.  She had three daughters with Krauss: Jamie Beryl Krauss, born July 4, 1980; Lindsay Leigh Krauss; and Sarah Emily Krauss. Lunden converted to Judaism when marrying Krauss.
Lunden was expecting her first child, Jamie when she began working at Good Morning America in 1980. She had enough "bargaining power" to have child-care provisions written into her contract. After an 8-week maternity leave, ABC provided facilities on set for her to breastfeed Jamie on set and on location for several months postpartum in 1980. Lunden said:  "I felt that no matter how much money I was making, if I couldn't be near my baby I couldn't work". Lunden brought Jamie to work every day, until she was six months old. After that, Jamie stayed home with a housekeeper. Lunden said: "I feel pressured to run home to be with her. On the other hand, I have responsibilities to my job. There is always that tug-of-war between child and job" (p. 28).
Lunden married the owner of Camp Takajo, Jeff Konigsberg on April 18, 2000. They have four children, two sets of twins, Jack, Kim (born 2005), Kate and Max (born 2003), born with the help of a surrogate mother. Lunden has become a spokeswoman for surrogacy.
Lunden's brother Jeff Blunden died from Type 2 diabetes at age 57 in 2007. She took care of her mother Gladyce Blunden, who had dementia and became an advocate for A Place for Mom, an assisted living referral service. Her mother died at the age of 94 in 2013.
On June 24, 2014, Lunden revealed on Good Morning America that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer.
