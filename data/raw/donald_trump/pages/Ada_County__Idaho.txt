== Government and politics ==
Ada County has traditionally been rather conservative for an urban county. Like Idaho as a whole, it has long been a Republican Party stronghold. The last victory in a presidential election by a Democrat in Ada County was by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. It rejected Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 during his 44-state landslide. Barry Goldwater carried it by 13 points, a major reason why Idaho was Johnson's closest state. In 2008 the presidential election in Ada County was more competitive than in previous years; John McCain defeated Barack Obama by six percentage points. Obama became the first Democrat to garner as much as 40 percent of the county's vote since Lyndon B. Johnson. In 2016, Donald Trump won the county by only a plurality due to high third party performance. In 2020, whereas the state of Idaho voted very strongly for Trump, he carried Ada County by a slim majority, only beating Joe Biden by around 3 percentage points. The election was close due to Biden's strength in Boise's downtown urban core, which gave him 59.2% of the vote to Trump's 37.4%. This is the narrowest election in decades for Ada County, and the closest a Democrat has come to carrying the county since 1940. Yet, in 2024, this trend reversed, with Trump once again taking the majority in the county with 53.76% of the vote. This was the best performance for a Republican presidential candidate in Ada county since George W. Bush in 2004.
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jerry Brady carried the county in his 2002 and 2006 races, despite losing statewide in both contests. Another prominent Democrat, Boise mayor David Bieter, was elected in 2007, 2011 and 2015.
Ada County is split between the first and second congressional districts; it is the only county in the state that is not located entirely within one district. As of 2022, the first district is represented by Russ Fulcher and includes Meridian, Eagle and Kuna, while the second district is represented by Mike Simpson and includes most of Boise proper. Both Fulcher and Simpson are Republicans.
In the Idaho Legislature, Ada County is split among nine districts, the most of any county. Each district elects one state senator and two state representatives. As of 2022, In the state senate, Republicans hold five seats and Democrats hold four. In the state house, Republicans hold ten seats and Democrats hold eight. Generally, Democratic strength is concentrated in Boise itself, while Republican strength is concentrated in the western suburbs. Several of the Boise seats were Democratic pickups in 2006.
Each party held all of their respective legislative seats in the 2008 elections, but Republicans won two competitive county commission races.
