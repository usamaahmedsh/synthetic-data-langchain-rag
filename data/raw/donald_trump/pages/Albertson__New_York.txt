Albertson is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 5,220 at the time of the 2020 census.


== History ==
The first European settler was John Seren who came from Connecticut in 1644. Later, Townsend Albertson started a farm and gristmill and the community eventually became known as Albertson, after him.
In 1850, a road was built through Albertson on the lands of Isaac Underhill Willets. The road is still known as I.U. Willets Road. (Willets complained that Long Island has more roads than it would ever need). The Long Island Rail Road opened an Albertson train station in 1864.
In 1908, the Long Island Motor Parkway was built through Albertson, along what is now its southern border with the Village of Williston Park. In 1938, it was closed, and in 1940, it was replaced by the Northern State Parkway, which runs along the northern border of Albertson, with Roslyn Heights.
In 1910, after a house in the Albertson Square section of the hamlet burned down in a blaze due to a lack of fire protection service in the area, locals created the Albertson Fire District to ensure the area would receive the necessary fire coverage. Seven years later, in 1917, the Albertson Water District was established. 
In 1946, major postwar suburbanization began in the community with the construction of a small development by William Levitt. 
In 1950, as the rapid suburbanization of the region continued, the Hillside Terrace-at-Albertson development – a large, 55-acre (22 ha) housing development wedged between Willis Avenue to the west, the Long Island Rail Road's Oyster Bay Branch to the east, I.U. Willets Road to the south, and an earlier development along Netz Place to the north – was constructed on land previously occupied by Bloodgood Nurseries. Developed by Joseph Carillo, Samuel Levin, and Joseph Wanes, the Hillside Terrace section included approximately 322 single-family homes and a large shopping center. This shopping center – The Shoppes at Willets Crossing (also known as the Albertson Shopping Center and Albertson Marketplace) – was built at a cost of approximately $75,000 (1950 USD) and is located at the northwestern corner of Willis Avenue and I.U. Willets Road. 
In 1953, the present Albertson Fire District headquarters – located on I.U. Willets Road – was constructed. 
To better serve the growing number of children residing within the portions of Albertson zoned for its schools and to relieve overcrowding in its other elementary schools, the Mineola Union Free School District opened the Meadow Drive Elementary School on Meadow Drive – located within the Albertson's Hillside Terrace neighborhood – in September 1954. The school's construction was approved by district residents on February 28, 1953, approving the resolution by a vote of 1,524-to-749. The school was officially dedicated on September 23, 1954.
In 1962, the Herricks Union Free School District's Searingtown Elementary School – located as of 2025 within Albertson, per the United States Census Bureau's boundaries – was one of the schools involved in the landmark Supreme Court case, Engel v. Vitale (1962). That case set the modern precedent in which government-directed prayers are prohibited in public schools.
By the mid-1960s, the last farms in Albertson had been developed over with housing and businesses, and the community had become fully suburban in character.
In 1977, sparked in large part out of concerns stemming from a controversial development proposal, locals formed the Albertson Square Civic Association – Albertson's local civic association. The organization continued to grow over the ensuing decades, and in 2025, it was renamed The Albertson Civic.
