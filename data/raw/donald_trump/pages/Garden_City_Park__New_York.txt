== History ==
From about 1787 until about 1874, the area was known as Clowesville, which was then the County Seat of Queens County, and contained the county courthouse and jail.
The community's name was eventually changed to Garden City Park due to its proximity to the then-new development of Garden City.
On December 7, 1993, six people were killed and nineteen were injured in a racially-motivated mass shooting aboard an eastbound Long Island Rail Road train at the Merillion Avenue station – Garden City Park's local LIRR station.
