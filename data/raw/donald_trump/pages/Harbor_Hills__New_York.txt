Harbor Hills is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located on the Great Neck Peninsula within the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 562 at the time of the 2020 census.


== History ==
In 1956, the Town of North Hempstead approved the construction of the community's swimming pool and its bathhouses – and approved of the creation of the Harbor Hills Park District, which was created specifically for the construction of the community's new park complex and subsequently its operations and maintenance. The contract was awarded to Great Neck-based Schumacher & Forelle, which bid $169,500 (1956 USD) for the pool's construction, and promised to do the work in 110 days. The project was paid for by the hamlet's roughly 175 residents.
The community's pool was reconstructed between 1986 and 1989, and was again paid for by the residents of the hamlet. This controversial project led to a lawsuit filed by residents over the payments and unexpected rises in taxes, which the Harbor Hills Civic Association asserted were due to the Town of North Hempstead overpaying, expanding the project, and failing to properly communicate with or notify the locals.
The Harbor Hills CDP was first created for the 2000 United States Census.
