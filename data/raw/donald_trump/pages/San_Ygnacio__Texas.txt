San Ygnacio is a census-designated place (CDP) in Zapata County, Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the CDP population was 504. It is named for the prominent Spanish saint, Ignatius of Loyola. The portion of the community between the Rio Grande and U.S. Highway 83 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as San Ygnacio Historic District.


== History ==

San Ygnacio, originally a Mexican pueblo, was founded in 1830 by settlers from nearby Guerrero, Tamaulipas on the outskirts of the recently established Uribeno Ranch. Frequent Comanche attacks in the early days of San Ygnacio necessitated the use of defensive stone architecture which has endowed the present area with uncharacteristically enduring historical sites from that period.
San Ygnacio is also historically notable for its involvement in the short-lived revolution of the Rio Grande Republic, which was established at meetings which were convened in the town in 1839.
San Ygnacio played an important role in the Garza Revolution from 1891 to 1893. Multiple small battles were fought near the town in both Mexican and American territory.
San Ygnacio was attacked in June 1916 by either Mexican Carrancistas or Seditionists. On June 10, approximately 100 Mexicans fought a losing battle with about 150 American soldiers from the 14th Cavalry.
San Ygnacio was the site of the filming of the 1952 film Viva Zapata.
Although many of San Ygnacio's neighboring municipalities were evacuated and consolidated in the deliberate 1953 flooding of the region which created Falcon Lake and "New" Zapata, San Ygnacio's residents petitioned for the right to remain on their land, which was high enough to escape substantial damage. Having survived, its architectural heritage was acknowledged in 1972 when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, being the last standing collection of Mexican Ranch vernacular architecture, representing the 19th century settlement of the lower Rio Grande valley.  Its oldest building is now a National Historic Landmark, the Treviño-Uribe Rancho, built 1830.
The private River Pierce Foundation works to continue the restoration of the San Ygnacio Historic District.
