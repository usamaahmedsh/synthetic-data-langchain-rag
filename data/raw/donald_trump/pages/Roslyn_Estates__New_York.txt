Roslyn Estates is a village in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is considered part of the Greater Roslyn area, which is anchored by the Incorporated Village of Roslyn. The population was 1,318 at the time of the 2020 census.


== History ==


=== Before the village (pre-colonization – 1931) ===
The area where Roslyn Estates is located was originally inhabited by the Matinecock Native Americans. European colonists started to settle in the area in the 17th century – specifically settlers of Dutch and English heritage. From that point until the early 20th century, much of what is now the Village of Roslyn Estates consisted of farmland and estates.
Around 1908, the land was purchased by developer Dean Alvord, who also developed Prospect Park South in Brooklyn and Belle Terre in Port Jefferson. On this land, Alvord would create the planned, residential community that today forms the Village of Roslyn Estates, under the name "Roslyn Estates, Incorporated". It was nicknamed "The Eden of Long Island" when originally developed, due to the community's design and setting.
In 1911, the community's civic association, known as the Association of Roslyn Estates, was formed. As of 2024, it is the oldest active civic association in Nassau County.


=== Village of Roslyn Estates (1931 – present) ===
In 1931, residents decided to try incorporating Roslyn Estates as a village, due to the fact that the community's original deed restrictions were set to expire around that time. Their efforts to incorporate were successful, and the Village of Roslyn Estates was incorporated on June 8, 1931.
In the mid-1950s, a 27-acre (11 ha) housing development, known as Homes in Roslyn Estates, was constructed in the village, and sponsored by builders Edward Fineberg and Arthur Bandes and consisting of 60 ranch and split-level homes designed by architect Stanley J. Shaftel.
In 1972, Roslyn Estates Village Hall was built. It was designed by John A. Grammas on land given to the village by the firm of Saul Sokolov, Inc., which had developed that section of Roslyn Estates several years prior.
In 1974, Mayor Robert D. Zucker attempted to have the boundaries of the Manhasset Park District redrawn to include the village after the district added an additional 260 parking spaces to the commuter parking fields at the Manhasset Long Island Rail Road station. Zucker stated that many Roslyn Estates residents preferred the Manhasset station over the closer Roslyn station due to the fact that service to/from Pennsylvania Station on the Port Washington Branch is direct, whereas a change at Jamaica is required on the Oyster Bay Branch. By having the district boundaries redrawn to include the village, Roslyn Estates residents would have the ability to be guaranteed a parking space at the Manhasset station for commuting to/from Manhattan. Officials from both the Town of North Hempstead and the Manhasset Park District – as well as Manhasset residents – lamented the idea, given that Roslyn Estates is not part of the Greater Manhasset area, and felt that the needs of Greater Manhasset should be paramount for the Manhasset Park District. The proposal was ultimately denied.
Roslyn Estates celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1981.


=== Etymology ===
The name of Roslyn Estates was taken directly from the name which was used by the community's original development group, Roslyn Estates, Incorporated. The "Roslyn" part of its name is shared with Roslyn, Roslyn Harbor, and Roslyn Heights, and ultimately can be traced back to when the name "Roslyn" was chosen for that village, which was chosen because the geography in Roslyn reminded officials of the geography of Roslin, Scotland.


== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2), all land.


=== Topography ===
Like the rest of Long Island's North Shore, Roslyn Estates is situated on a terminal moraine known as the Harbor Hill Moraine. This moraine was formed by glaciers during the Wisconsin Glacial Episode, The moraine is named for Harbor Hill – the highest geographic point in Nassau County, which is located in nearby East Hills.
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Geological Survey, the highest point in Roslyn Estates is located between The Pines and The Hemlocks, at 287 feet (87 m), and the lowest point is located near The Locusts, at approximately 170 feet (52 m).
