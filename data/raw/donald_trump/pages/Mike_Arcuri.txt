=== Controversy ===
In 2002, Arcuri personally prosecuted Joseph A. Smith of Oneida for the murder of Desiree Case of Yorkville. Her body was discovered in an abandoned house on February 26, 2000. Smith was arrested on November 29, 2001, after he was charged with two counts of second-degree murder in a sealed indictment. A jury found Smith guilty of both counts of murder in March 2002. In late June 2002 a judge set aside the conviction, when Arcuri brought forward evidence he discovered that the defense was not provided with in the case, most notably the confession of another man, Earl Wright, who was eventually found guilty of the murder of Case. Arcuri dropped charges against Smith and he was released from jail on August 1, 2002. He later filed a claim for misconduct and negligence against the Oneida County District Attorney's Office and the City of Utica, N.Y., Police Department, which was settled out of court.
