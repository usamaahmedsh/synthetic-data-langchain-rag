== History ==
Olmos Park was developed in the 1920s as an exclusive suburb of San Antonio, which today completely surrounds it. H.C. Thorman, a renowned oilman and real estate tycoon, purchased property from an Austrian count and developed it into the posh Olmos Park.  The city occupied the site where Camp John Wise was built in 1917.  Camp John Wise was a US Army balloonist training site.  The camp shut down in 1919 when the balloonist training was moved to nearby Brooks Field.
Sometimes confused with the City of Olmos Park, Olmos Park Terrace, was developed by the same developer a few years later in the 1930s as part of his larger Olmos District development and borders Olmos Park's western edge. Olmos Park Terrace was designated a San Antonio Historic District on Oct. 4, 2007 by Ord. 2007-10-04-1070.
