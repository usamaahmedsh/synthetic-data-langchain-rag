The Trump dance is a celebratory dance inspired by 45th and 47th U.S. president Donald Trump's characteristic rally gestures while dancing to his campaign song "Y.M.C.A." by the Village People.  The dance typically involves slowly punching the air and moving one's hips.


== Background ==
The dance originated at Trump's 2020 campaign rallies and gained more media attention at his 2024 campaign rallies, where his movements became a notable aspect of his public persona. Over time, these gestures were popularized through social media and eventually adopted by individuals outside the political sphere.
The dance is performed by rocking the hips in a side-to-side motion while performing alternating, subdued fist pumps. In October 2024, Trump began occasionally incorporating a pantomime golf swing into the dance. According to the Times of India, this sparked "a wave of reaction" on social media.

The Trump dance is frequently performed to the musical accompaniment of the Village People's "Y.M.C.A.", which Trump has called the "gay national anthem".


== Adoption in sports ==
The Trump dance has been observed in major sporting events, with athletes incorporating it into their celebratory routines.


=== National Football League (NFL) ===
NFL players, including Brock Bowers of the Las Vegas Raiders, Calvin Ridley of the Tennessee Titans, Nick Bosa of the San Francisco 49ers, and Za'Darius Smith of the Detroit Lions, have been noted for performing the dance. Similar celebrations have also been documented among college football athletes.
In late November 2024, the NFL announced it would not penalize players who performed the Trump dance during league games. According to football analyst Jordan Schultz, the NFL indicated "that they only take action against those [play celebrations] deemed excessive or inappropriate" but that the league "is good" with the Trump dance.


=== Major League Baseball (MLB) ===
During a game that Trump attended on September 11, 2025 between the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers, three Tigers players, Dillon Dingler, Wenceel Pérez, and Gleyber Torres did the dance following base hits.


=== Soccer ===
U.S. national soccer team captain Christian Pulisic used the dance to celebrate his goal in a 2024–25 CONCACAF Nations League A match against Jamaica on November 18, 2024. Pulisic later stated, "It's not a political dance. It was just for fun." A few days prior, players of the English team Barnsley performed the dance after scoring a goal in a 2024–25 EFL League One game against Cambridge United.


=== Mixed martial arts ===
Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight champion Jon Jones incorporated the dance into his post-match celebrations during an event attended by Trump.


=== Golf ===
Professional golfer Charley Hull performed the dance during a tournament match on November 17, 2024.


== Cultural significance ==
The Trump dance is widely regarded as an example of the intersection of sports and political culture, although athletes often characterize its use as non-political. Supporters of the dance argue it reflects Trump's broader cultural influence, while detractors view it as a polarizing gesture.
In the week prior to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, "Y.M.C.A.", to which the Trump dance is frequently performed, appeared in the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic chart for the first time in 47 years, rising to the number four spot shortly after the election and, according to songwriter Victor Willis, grossing "several million dollars" since Trump's adoption of the tune. Karen Willis, the manager of the Village People, attributed the song's sudden resurgence to Trump's use of it during his performances of the Trump dance.
In a November 2024 New York Times column by Maureen Dowd, Dowd said she was going to solicit "younger members of the family" to teach her the dance. The same month, Javier Milei, the president of Argentina and a political ally of Trump, performed the Trump dance during a gala at Mar-a-Lago. Videos of Milei performing the dance "rippled across social media", according to The Daily Beast.
