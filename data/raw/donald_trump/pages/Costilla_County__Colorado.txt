Costilla County (Spanish for "rib") is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,499. The county seat is San Luis, the oldest continuously occupied town in Colorado.


== History ==
On July 8, 1694, Spanish Conquistador Don Diego de Vargas and his army, two weeks before the Battle of Astialakwa, reached Costilla County. Diego Vargas is not the first Spaniard in Colorado. Juan de Archuleta led an expedition into Colorado in 1664 – his expedition is the first traceable Spanish expedition into Colorado. In 1647, Governor Luis Rosas fought with the Utes in northern New Mexico. While Rosa came near Colorado, it has not been verified he actually did.
Costilla County was the first area of Colorado to have been colonized. The county made up the major part of the Sangre de Cristo Land Grant awarded by the government of New Mexico to the Carlos Beaubien family in 1843. Hispanic settlers from Taos, New Mexico, officially established San Luis on April 9, 1851. Costilla County was one of the original 17 counties created by the Territory of Colorado on November 1, 1861. The county was named for Costilla Creek. San Miguel was originally designated the county seat, but the county government was moved to San Luis in 1863. (In 1869, surveys placed San Miguel in the New Mexico Territory.)
The county's original boundaries extended over much of south-central Colorado. Much of the northern portion became part of Saguache County in 1866, and the western portions were folded into Hinsdale and Rio Grande counties in 1874. Costilla County arrived at its modern boundaries in 1913 when Alamosa County was created from its northwest portions.

== Politics ==
Costilla County has a heavily Hispanic population and has long been a Democratic stronghold. The last Republican to carry the county was Calvin Coolidge in 1924, and the last to gain an absolute majority William Howard Taft in 1912 – an era when most votes in these high valley counties were done for the voters by political machines. In the last eleven Presidential elections the Democratic candidate has consistently received over sixty percent of the county's vote and four times won over seventy percent. In recent years, however, Republicans have gained ground in Costilla County and other areas of southern Colorado, with Republican candidate Donald Trump breaking 40% of the vote while holding Democratic candidate Kamala Harris below 60% of the vote, both for the first time since 1972. This was the strongest shift toward the Republican party out of all Colorado counties in this election, mirroring the trends seen in other majority-Hispanic counties in the rest of the country.

In Colorado's first elections as a state in 1876, Auguste Lacome (D) ran against William H. Meyer (R) for State Senate in Costilla County, then Colorado's 18th District. Meyer would later become the Lt. Governor of Colorado. Votes cast for "Locome" and "Lacompte" were included in the count for Lacome. Meyer carried the election 349–204.
It is part of Colorado's 3rd congressional district, which has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+7 and is represented by Republican Jeff Hurd. In the Colorado Senate, it is in District 6 and is represented by Republican Cleave Simpson. In the Colorado House of Representatives, it is in District 62 and is represented by Democrat Matthew Martinez.
