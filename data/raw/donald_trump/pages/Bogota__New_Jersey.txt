Bogota is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 8,778, an increase of 591 (+7.2%) from the 2010 census count of 8,187, which in turn reflected a decline of 62 (−0.8%) from the 8,249 counted in the 2000 census.
Bogota was formed on November 14, 1894, from portions of Ridgefield Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The borough was formed during the "Boroughitis" phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed during 1894 alone. Portions of Bogota were taken in 1895 to form part of the newly created Township of Teaneck. Bogota was named in honor of the Bogert family, which had been the first European settlers to occupy the area, and may also be a blend of Bogert and Banta, another early family, with an "O" added to ease pronunciation.
The borough's name is pronounced  buh-GOH-tə, unlike Bogotá, capital city of Colombia, which is accented on the final syllable.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Bogota is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Bogota is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body, with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2024, the mayor of the Borough of Bogota is Republican Daniele Fede, serving a term of office that expires on December 31, 2027. Members of the Bogota Borough Council are Council President Consuelo M. Carpenter (D, 2024), Lisa Kohles (D, 2026), Patrick H. McHale (D, 2025), John G. Mitchell (D, 2025), Mary Ellen Murphy (D, 2023), Robert Robbins (D, 2024) and Diana Vergara (D, 2026).
Kathryn Gates-Ferris was appointed in late 2015 to fill the seat vacated by Lisa Kohles.
The council seat expiring in 2015 held by Chris Kelemen was vacated when he took office as mayor in January 2015. Citing the bitter political differences in the governing body and the loss of two council seats to Republican challengers in the general election that month, Mayor Patrick McHale resigned from office in November 2013 and was replaced on an acting basis by Council President Tito Jackson, who served in that role until the November 2014 election. In September 2011, the borough council appointed Wanda Uceta to fill the vacant seat of Joseph Nooto who had died earlier that month. In December 2013, Lisa Kohles was chosen to fill Jackson's vacant council seat for a term ending in December 2014.
In 2012, Democrats retained full control of borough government, as incumbent Jorge Nunez won re-election along with his running mate Robert Robbins, who won his first term in office.
In the November 2011 general election, Democrats gained control of all of the borough's elected positions. Patrick McHale was re-elected to a four-year term as mayor. Incumbents Michael Brophy and Tito Jackson were elected to new three-year terms, while Wanda Uceta won a two-year unexpired term and Evaristo Burdiez Jr. won his first full three-year term, after both Burdiez and Uceta had been appointed to fill vacancies.
In the 2010 General Election, Councilmen Joseph Noto and Michael Brophy won reelection, while first-time candidate Arthur Konigsberg also captured a seat. They defeated Councilwoman Anne Marie Mitchell and challengers Jared Geist and Guillermo Martinez. Brophy led the way with 1,235 votes, followed by Noto with 1,072 and Konigsberg with 1,060. Mitchell received 966 votes, while Geist and Martinez earned 847 and 775 votes, respectively. Noto and Konigsberg won three-year terms, while Brophy—who was appointed to fill a vacancy last year—will serve for an additional year to finish the uncompleted term.
In July 2006, then-Mayor Lonegan created a controversy when he engineered a borough council resolution requesting the removal of a Spanish-language billboard in the borough that was advertising McDonald's iced coffee. Lonegan said the billboard was "divisive." The story received national publicity, occurring concurrently with a national debate on illegal immigration. The 2003 mayoral election won by Lonegan was the subject of the documentary Anytown, USA.
