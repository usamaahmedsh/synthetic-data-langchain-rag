Ralph Frederick Peo (May 3, 1897 – November 29, 1966) was an American inventor, engineer, business executive in the automobile industry, and the holder of 150 patents. He was founder of Frontier Industries in Buffalo, New York and was CEO of Houdaille Industries from 1955 to 1962 and chairman of the board from 1956 to 1964. A pioneer in the development of the automobile shock absorber, Peo invented the first thermostatically controlled shock absorber.  He also invented one of the earliest air conditioners for use in automobiles.


== Early life ==
Peo was born in Rochester, New York, the oldest of three sons of Julien Frederick Peo and Flora (VanSchaick) Peo.  The Peo family had come to America from France in 1832 and settled in Jefferson County, New York. The French spelling of the family surname was Peillot. His father encouraged him to work creatively with his hands. He had a workshop with many valuable tools in the basement of their home on Richard Street, Rochester.  He attended Rochester Public School No. 15 and The Mechanics Institute of Rochester where he graduated in 1915 with a mechanical engineering degree.


== Career ==
After college, he went to Detroit, Michigan to gain experience in the automobile industry. He first worked for Packard Motor Car Corporation as a draftsman and purposely changed jobs every year for the next five years. He first moved to Dodge Brothers, then Oakland, Ford Motor Companies, and, finally, General Motors.  He became acquainted with Charles F. Kettering of General Motors, who he regarded as the greatest American inventor in the automotive field. He worked in the Detroit auto industry for nine years until 1924 when he relocated to Buffalo, New York to become the assistant chief engineer at the American Radiator Company. In October 1927, Henry Ford wrote to A.B. Schultz, president of the Houde Engineering Corporation of Buffalo, manufactures of Houdaille shock absorbers. Ford told Schultz that if he hired 30 year old Peo to supervise production at the Buffalo plant, then Ford would install Houdaille shock absorbers on every Ford automobile manufactured. Houde Engineering was acquired by the Houdaille-Hershey Corporation and Peo became Executive Vice President of Houdaille-Hershey and president of the Buffalo Division.
During World War II he continued to manage the Buffalo Houdaille operations as well as the Buffalo Arms, Incorporated, a newly formed subsidiary of Houdaille-Hershey, which manufactured machine guns. He was known to be a production wizard.  His motto was "get it done".
After WWII, he resigned from Houdaille and formed Frontier Industries by putting together a group of four diversified manufacturing companies, Buffalo Arms,  Buffalo Crushed Stone, Fairmount Tool and Forging Company of Cleveland, Ohio, and Manzel Brothers, manufactures of lubricating machines.
In 1955 Frontier Industries merged with Detroit-based Houdaille-Hershey.  Peo became CEO, the corporate name was changed to Houdaille Industries and the corporate headquarters was moved to Buffalo.
By the end of 1961 Peo had developed Houdaille into a national business leader in the construction materials, automotive parts, and industrial tools & machinery industries with over $80 million in annual sales, over 60 business locations in the United States and Canada and 9,783 shareholders. Peo retired as CEO in 1962 and continued as Chairman of the Board until 1964, when he became Chairman Emeritus.


== Personal life ==
Peo was an avid gardener. At one time he cultivated over 100,000 tulips in his garden at his Buffalo home. He also had a life long passion for boating.  In his youth he would paddle a small boat along the shores of Lake Ontario, near Rochester, and sing to onlookers to earn spending money. As an adult, he purchased larger watercraft, the largest, a 60 foot yacht named HI Lady (for Houdaille Industries). Later in life he owned a 50+ foot Hatteras yacht named the BarBeth IV (for his daughters). In 1917 Peo married Magdeline Heath who died in 1942 at age 48.  They had one son, Jack Heath Peo (1919–1968).  In 1943 he married Ethelmay Brent (1909–1971) and they had two daughters. He died in Buffalo on November 29, 1966.
