This is a list of members of the Electoral College, known as "electors", who cast ballots to elect the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election. There are 538 electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. On Monday December 19, 2016, they formally elected Donald Trump of New York and Mike Pence of Indiana to the presidency and vice presidency respectively.
While every state except Nebraska and Maine chooses its electors by statewide vote, many states require that one elector be designated for each congressional district. These electors are chosen by each party before the general election. A vote for that party then confirms their position. In all states except Nebraska and Maine, the electors are winner-take-all. In Maine and Nebraska within each congressional district one elector is allocated by popular vote; the states' remaining two electors, representing the two U.S. Senate seats, are winner-take-both. Except where otherwise noted, such designations refer to the elector's residence in that district rather than election by the voters of the district. Ultimately, Donald Trump received 304 electoral votes and Hillary Clinton 227, as two faithless electors defected from Trump and five defected from Clinton. Four faithless electors were from Washington (defected from Clinton), two from Texas (defected from Trump) and one from Hawaii (defected from Clinton).
