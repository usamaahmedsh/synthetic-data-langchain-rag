=== Politics ===
Lexington County was one of the first areas of South Carolina to support the Republican Party. The last official Democratic candidate to carry the county at a presidential level was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, and the official Democratic candidate last won 40 percent of the county's vote in 1952. It supported splinter Dixiecrat candidates in 1948 and 1956.
In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Lexington County voted 64.2% in favor of Republican Donald Trump and 34.1% in favor of Democrat Joe Biden with 72.6% of the eligible electorate voting. This was the strongest performance by a Democratic candidate for president since 1976.

The county's Republican bent is not limited to national politics; its voters frequently reject Democrats at the state level as well. The county has supported the Republican candidate for governor in every election since 1982 when Richard Riley carried every county in the state. The last Democratic senatorial nominee to manage even 30 percent of the county's vote was Inez Tenenbaum in 2004, and no Democrat has carried the county since Ernest "Fritz" Hollings did so in 1980. In 1986, it was the only county in the state to support Hollings' Republican opponent, future Governor Henry McMaster. It was one of the first areas where Republicans broke the long Democratic monopoly on state and local offices. For much of his tenure, longtime state senator Nikki Setzler was the only elected Democrat above the county level. He was succeeded in 2024 by fellow Democrat Russell Ott.
On November 4, 2014, Lexington County residents voted against a proposed sales tax increase. The money generated from this tax would have mostly been used to improve traffic conditions upon roadways. That same day, residents voted to repeal a ban on alcohol sales on Sundays within the county.
