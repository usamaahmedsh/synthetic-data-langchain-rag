Kalawao County (Hawaiian: Kalana o Kalawao) is a county in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is the smallest county in the 50 states by land area and the second-smallest county by population, after Loving County, Texas. The county encompasses the peninsula on the north coast of the island of Molokaʻi. The peninsula was developed and used from 1866 to 1969 as a leper colony, chosen because it is isolated from the rest of Molokaʻi by cliffs over a quarter-mile high; the only land access is a mule trail, now closed to visitors.
Due to the small population (82 as of the 2020 United States census), Kalawao County does not have the same functions as other Hawaii counties. Instead, it operates as a judicial district of Maui County, which includes the rest of the island of Molokaʻi. The county has no elected government.


== History ==
The Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, the Republic of Hawaiʻi, the Territory of Hawaii, and the state of Hawaii all exiled persons suffering from Hansen's disease (leprosy) to the peninsula, from 1866 to 1969. The quarantine policy was only lifted after effective antibiotic treatments were developed that could be administered on an outpatient basis and patients could be rendered non-contagious.
Many residents chose to remain in their familiar community on the peninsula. The state promised that they could live there for the rest of their lives. As of 2015, the population consisted of the remaining patients, plus state employees and park staff.  Tourists 16 years of age and older and personal guests of residents may visit with prior government permission, and the general public must be part of an official tour.
In 1980, the Kalaupapa National Historical Park was established to preserve the county's history and environment.


== Government ==
Kalawao County lacks a local, county government. Instead, Kalawao County is administered by the Hawaii Department of Health because of the history of the settlement and current patients living there. Under Hawaiian state law, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health, who is appointed by the Governor, also serves as the Mayor of Kalawao County.  The Mayor holds executive powers within the county; the mayor also appoints a county sheriff, who is selected from local residents. The only county statutes that apply to Kalawao County directly are those on matters of health.
Kalawao is part of the First Judicial Circuit, which includes the entire island of Oahu. For the purpose of notarization, the designated venue for the First Judicial Circuit is "State of Hawaii, City and County of Honolulu."
The U.S. Census Bureau does not count the Kawalao County as its own county government and instead considers it a dependency of the Hawaiian state government.


== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 53 square miles (140 km2), comprising 12 square miles (31 km2) of land and 41 square miles (110 km2) (77.3%) of water. By land area, it is the smallest true county in the United States; some independent cities in Virginia are smaller and are sometimes considered to be "county equivalents" for statistical purposes such as with the US Census Bureau.


=== Kalaupapa Peninsula ===
Kalaupapa Peninsula contains the county's only settlement, Kalaupapa. The Kalaupapa Peninsula developed from lava that erupted from the ocean floor near Kauhakō Crater and spread outward, forming a low shield volcano. This was the most recent volcanic episode on the island and of the larger East Molokaʻi shield volcano, occurring after the formation of the cliffs by erosion.


=== Subdivisions ===

Kalawao County is composed of four ahupuaʻa. From west to east:

== Transportation ==
The only access to Kalawao County is by air, or by a steep mule trail that descends 1,600 ft (490 m) from the rest of Molokaʻi, closed to visitors since a landslide in 2018.  Kalaupapa Airport has scheduled air service to Molokaʻi Airport and to Honolulu Airport.
Freight is delivered to the county once a year, usually in July, by barge.


== Politics ==

Like the rest of the state, Kalawao County is a stronghold for the Democratic Party. It was the only county in the United States where the Republican candidate in the 2016 United States presidential election, Donald Trump, finished in third by only getting one vote; 70% of Kalawao's voters chose Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and 25% of Kalawao voters cast their ballots for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, making it Stein's strongest county nationwide in terms of vote percentage. In 2020 Joe Biden improved on Clinton's 2016 performance by over 25% as the Greens declined to zero votes, giving Biden 96% of the vote, which was his strongest performance in any county in the United States. This is one of four counties, along with Jim Hogg County, Texas, Brooks County, Texas, and Menominee County, Wisconsin, that have never voted Republican.
However, many people in Kalawao County are also socially conservative, with this county being the only one in the state to vote against 2024 Hawaii Amendment 1, which repealed a state constitutional amendment that allowed Hawaii's legislature to outlaw same-sex marriage.


== Education ==
The county is within the Hawaii Department of Education school district.
