=== New York State Senate ===
In November 1994, Ralph J. Marino, who had represented the area around the Nassau-Suffolk line since 1969, was deposed from his post as Senate Majority Leader. After Marino resigned from office, a special election was called for on March 13, 1995. Marcellino was nominated by Republicans to face Mary A. McCaffery, a Democrat who worked as a fund-raiser for nonprofit agencies. He would go on to easily win that race with 60% of the vote. Marcellino would go on to win re-election eleven times, only facing serious opposition in 2016; that year, Marcellino defeated challenger Jim Gaughran by only 1,761 votes. In 2018, Gaughran challenged Marcellino again. This time, Gaughran prevailed.
In 2011, Marcellino voted against allowing same-sex marriage in New York during a senate roll-call vote on the Marriage Equality Act, which the Senate narrowly passed 33–29. He also voted in favor of the 2013 gun control law known as the NY SAFE Act.
