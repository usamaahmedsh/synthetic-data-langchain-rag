=== Government ===
The county government is a constitutional body granted specific powers by the Constitution of Arkansas and the Arkansas Code. The quorum court is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all spending and revenue collection. Representatives are called justices of the peace and are elected from county districts every even-numbered year. The number of districts in a county vary from nine to fifteen, and district boundaries are drawn by the county election commission. The Pulaski County Quorum Court has fifteen members. Presiding over quorum court meetings is the county judge, who serves as the chief executive officer of the county. The county judge is elected at-large and does not vote in quorum court business, although capable of vetoing quorum court decisions.

The composition of the Quorum Court after the 2024 elections is 10 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Justices of the Peace (members) of the Quorum Court following the elections are:

== Politics ==
Pulaski County is one of the most Democratic counties in Arkansas and the Southern United States. The city of North Little Rock was ranked the most liberal community in the state.
In the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War, Republicans carried the county in every presidential election from 1868 to 1888. Since then, Republicans have only won the county four times: 1956, 1972, 1984, and 1988, all national Republican landslides.
Pulaski County has followed in the footsteps of most urban counties across the country, especially in the era of Barack Obama's presidency and post-presidency that has seen urban areas turn bluer and rural areas, such as most of Arkansas, to become even redder and more conservative. Donald Trump, the two-time winner of the state with over 60% of the vote, only garnered about 38% in this county, among his worst performances in this state. Joe Biden's 59.98% share in 2020 is the highest for a Democrat in the county since 1976, besting even Arkansas native Bill Clinton in both 1992 and 1996.

=== Townships ===
Townships in Arkansas are the divisions of a county. Each township includes unincorporated areas and some may have incorporated towns or cities within part of their space. Townships have limited purposes in modern times. However, the US Census does list Arkansas population based on townships (often referred to as "minor civil divisions"). Townships are also of value for historical purposes in terms of genealogical research. Each town or city is within one or more townships in an Arkansas county based on census maps. Pulaski County only has two townships, as of 2010. They are listed below.
