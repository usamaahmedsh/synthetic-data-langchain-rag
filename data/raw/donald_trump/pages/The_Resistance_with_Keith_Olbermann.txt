The Resistance with Keith Olbermann (originally titled The Closer with Keith Olbermann) was a political web series hosted by Keith Olbermann for GQ. It premiered on September 13, 2016, and ended on November 27, 2017. Typically three new episodes were posted every week and centered around criticism of then United States presidential Candidate, and later President of the United States Donald Trump. They are stylistically similar to the Special Comments from Olbermann's previous work, Countdown with Keith Olbermann.
On November 27, 2017, Olbermann announced his retirement from political commentary after episode 147 had aired, citing his belief that "this . . . presidency of Donald John Trump will end prematurely and end soon, and I am thus also confident that this is the correct moment to end this series of commentaries".
