Burrillville is a town in Providence County, Rhode Island. The population was 16,158 at the 2020 census.


== History ==
Burrillville was settled around 1662 by English colonists as part of Glocester, Rhode Island. John Smith and members of the Saulsbury family were among the earliest settlers. Samuel Willard treated many smallpox victims in South Uxbridge and Glocester (Burrillville). In 1806, Burrillville became a separate town and consisted of 60 square miles (160 km2) of land in the northwestern corner of Rhode Island, bordering Connecticut and Massachusetts.  Boundary disputes with Massachusetts and Glocester reduced this land area by the mid-19th century.  Joktan Putnam was the first town moderator. 
The various mills and villages took shape in the 19th century, such as Harris mills and the village of Harrisville, Mapleville mills, and Oakland mills. The town is today part of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, New England's historic National Park area. 
Burrillville was incorporated as an independent municipality on November 17, 1806, when the Rhode Island General Assembly authorized the residents of North Glocester to elect their own officers.  The town was named for Senator James Burrill Jr., who was the Rhode Island Attorney General.
