The Tax March (also known as the Tax Day March and Trump's Tax Day) was a series of demonstrations held in more than 150 locations throughout the United States on April 15, 2017. The intent was to pressure U.S. President Donald Trump to release his tax returns.
At least 180 march events were organized in the United States and abroad. The protests were a response to the perceived lack of transparency in the Trump administration, and the fact that President Trump still had not released his tax returns by that date, contrary to his promise that he would. April 15 is the deadline for most  households to file income tax returns in the United States, though in 2017 the deadline was April 18 as the 15th fell on a Saturday.


== Background ==
The march organizers demanded that President Trump release his IRS tax returns, as he promised he would during his campaign. Tax Day protests have been held since the 1990s and earlier, although until then typically by libertarian groups. The Tea Party movement got started in part with a Tax Day protest on April 15, 2009.
After 300,000 American citizens signed an online petition on WhiteHouse.gov in January 2017, Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway announced Trump would not release his tax returns due to lack of interest. In response, a Tax Day March was planned for April 15, 2017, to be held in over two dozen major cities in the U.S., to pressure Trump to release his tax returns.
The idea for the march was originally proposed on Twitter on January 22, 2017 by law professor Jennifer Taub, followed soon after by comedian Frank Lesser. Some Tax Day march events were planned independently, without awareness of the tweets by Taub or Lesser.
Unlike most liberal protests in the United States, the Tax March did not focus on broad issues, but instead focused on a specific demand.


== Organizers and participating groups ==
Taub, who proposed the march idea on Twitter, later joined the executive committee for the march. Lesser has also helped plan and publicize the event.
Groups convening for the march included the American Federation of Teachers, Color of Change, Democracy Spring, Media Matters for America, MoveOn.org, the National Education Association, the National Women's Law Center, and Public Citizen.
In early April 2017, march organizers wrote letters to Republican Congress members who had called on Trump to release his tax returns, asking them to attend the march and to "hold the President accountable".


== Planning ==
Marches were planned, and took place in over 150 cities throughout the United States. Marches in at least eighteen U.S. cities featured giant inflatable "Trump chickens", originally designed by a graphic artist in Seattle and manufactured in Zhejiang, China for the Chinese Lunar New Year (for the Year of the Rooster). The San Francisco Tax March organizer who ordered the first inflatables felt that they symbolized that "Donald Trump was a big chicken for not releasing his taxes." Organizers using the Tax Day's Facebook page chose to focus events on "government transparency, conflicts of interest and an unfair tax system," according to CNBC.

== Aftermath ==


=== Official reactions ===
When asked to comment on the march by The Washington Post on April 13, the White House referred to remarks made earlier in the week by press secretary Sean Spicer, who stated that the President is under IRS audit but has been transparent with his finances. On Easter Sunday, April 16, 2017, Trump tweeted twice about the Tax March. First he tweeted, "I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?" and then, "Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!"


=== Reactions ===
Scarlett Bustos, vice chair of Tax March Sacramento, said "When the administration said that he wasn't going to release his tax returns, he said the people don't care, and we're here to show that nationally that the people do care." Protesters have also appealed to their representatives to urge Trump to release his taxes.
David Myers, a professor at University of California, Irvine said that the march "kind of trolls Donald Trump, and then he almost always responds badly and says something stupid." Jason Silverstein of the New York Daily News commented, "Apparently unable to decide whether the election talk must end or must continue, Trump was also egged by the latest flareups over his tax returns, which even this year's tax filing season has failed to unveil." Nick Merrell tweeted a response to Trump's reaction, "Congratulations, you just confirmed for every single person that marched yesterday that it was well worth their time." Taub also felt that the marches caused Trump to pay attention, since he was tweeting about them the next day.


=== Counter-protests ===
Some Trump supporters planned counter-protests. Pro-Trump rallies were scheduled for April 15 in Colorado Springs, Colorado and Berkeley, California. The Berkeley demonstration, which was not officially related to the Tax March, turned violent, with pro- and anti-Trump groups clashing, and over a dozen arrests. No arrests were made at the Colorado Springs rally.
