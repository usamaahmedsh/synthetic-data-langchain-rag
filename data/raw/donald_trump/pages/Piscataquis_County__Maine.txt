Piscataquis County ( pih-SKAT-ə-kwiss) is a county located in the U.S. state of Maine. As of the 2020 census, its population was 16,800, making it Maine's least-populous county. Its county seat is Dover-Foxcroft. The county was incorporated on March 23, 1838, taken from the western part of Penobscot County and the eastern part of Somerset County. It is named for an Abenaki word meaning "branch of the river" or "at the river branch."
Originally, the county extended north to the Canada–US border, but in 1844 its northern portion was annexed by Aroostook County. In terms of land area, Piscataquis is one of the largest U.S. counties east of the Mississippi River. It is also one of two counties in the Northeast (and seven counties east of the Mississippi River) that meet Frederick Jackson Turner's requirements for "frontier" country – that is, having fewer than six inhabitants per square mile, the other being Hamilton County, New York.
Baxter State Park, a large wilderness preserve, is located in Piscataquis County.

==== US Senate ====


==== President ====

Piscataquis County is one of the most reliably Republican counties in New England, only voting for a someone other than the Republican candidate five times since 1880 — voting for Bull Moose Party nominee Theodore Roosevelt (a former Republican) in 1912, Democrats Lyndon B. Johnson and Hubert Humphrey in 1964 and 1968 respectively, independent Ross Perot in 1992, and Democrat Bill Clinton in 1996.
Since 2000, Piscataquis County has maintained its strong Republican lean, continuing to be the most reliably Republican county in Maine, and New England. In 2008, Piscataquis was the only county in New England to vote for John McCain, who won the county by a margin of 355 votes or 3.8% over Barack Obama, with Obama winning Maine by a 17.3% margin over McCain. In 2012, Piscataquis was only one of five counties in New England to support Republican candidate Mitt Romney, and the only county in Maine to do so. Romney received the most votes in Piscataquis County with 50.6%. Democratic incumbent Barack Obama received 46.3%. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 1.5% and Green Independent candidate Jill Stein received 1.24%. There were a total of 30 "write in" votes; 29 of these were for Ron Paul and 1 for Rocky Anderson. Barack Obama was reelected President. This makes the county the only one in New England to reject President Obama in both of his successful campaigns. Republican candidate Donald Trump carried the county in 2016 while greatly improving on Romney's performance. He won it again in 2020 with 62% of the vote, marking the first time a presidential candidate from any party won Piscataquis County with over 60% of the vote since Ronald Reagan in 1984.
