Anna Kaplan (née Monahemi) (born August 23, 1965) is an Iranian-American politician from Great Neck, New York. A Democrat, she was a member of the New York State Senate, representing New York's 7th State Senate district, which runs from the North Shore to roughly the central part of Western Nassau County on Long Island. She was a member of the so-called "Long Island Six," a group of six Democrats who represent Long Island in the New York State Senate and often vote as a block. She was elected in 2018 as part of a wave of Democrats who defeated Republican incumbents and brought control of the New York Senate to the Democrats for only the third time since World War II. She lost re-election in 2022 to Jack Martins.
Kaplan is the first Iranian-American to be elected to either of New York state's legislative chambers and she is the first former political refugee to serve in the New York Senate.

Kaplan was born to an Iranian Jewish family in Tabriz, Iran, and raised in Tehran, where her father was a carpet dealer. When the Islamic Revolution swept the country, Anna's parents sent her to the United States for safety at age 13. Arriving as an unaccompanied child refugee in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Anna was sent to live with a foster family in Chicago, Illinois, until her parents were able to legally enter the United States. After her family reunited in Chicago, they moved to Queens, New York, and then to Great Neck, New York.
Kaplan attended the Stern College at Yeshiva University, and received her J.D. from Cardozo School of Law in New York City.
