In the November 2022, Novakhov defeated incumbent assemblyman Steven Cymbrowitz by 19 percentage points. Novakhov made headlines when he introduced bill A.7612, which, if passed, would outlaw public smoking of Marijuana, citing "both the nuisance created by the smoke and the potential health hazards of second-hand smoke." His proposed bill would largely treat Marijuana smoking like Tobacco smoking, which is banned in Public places in New York City, but the ban is rarely enforced.
