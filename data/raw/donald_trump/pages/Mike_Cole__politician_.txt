==== Assembly censure ====
In 2007, Cole was formally censured by New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.  He admitted to drinking excessively with a student intern at a hockey party in Albany that was hosted by former Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, walked her home, and then spent the night in the woman's apartment with her.  These actions were direct violations of the Assembly policy against fraternization with student interns.

 Cole was quoted in an April 30, 2007 New York Times article by Danny Hakim regarding the incident, stating:
I ended up spending the night on her floor.  As wrong as it sounds now, at the time I didn't think it was such a bad decision to sleep there, being that I was incapable of driving. But it was. I should have taken a cab home...At no point in time did anything inappropriate occur, nor has anything been alleged. 
Additionally, Cole was removed as the ranking Republican on the Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Committee, was barred from the Assembly Intern Program, and lost the rights and privileges otherwise due to him per his seniority.
