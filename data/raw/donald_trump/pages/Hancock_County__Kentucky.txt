== Politics ==

Unlike most fellow Southern counties, Hancock County has been a swing county for most of its history. No party had won the county more than three times in a row (aside from a brief Republican streak from 1916 to 1928), but the county has swung sharply to the right in the 21st century. The county gave Barack Obama a majority of the votes in 2008, but went back to Republican hands in 2012, and has continued to swing further right since, with Donald Trump becoming the first candidate in history to gain over 70% of the vote in 2024. Hancock County is still relatively swingy socially, having voted in favor of abortion and legalizing medical marijuana. Like most counties in Kentucky, Hancock County is much more competitive at the local level due to Kentucky's high number of conservative Democrats and Kentucky's previously Democratic history.
