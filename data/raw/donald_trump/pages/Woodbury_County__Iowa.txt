== History ==
Originally established in 1851 as Wahkaw County, the Iowa Legislature in 1853 changed the name to Woodbury County in honor of Levi Woodbury (1789–1851), a senator and governor of New Hampshire who served as a Supreme Court justice from 1844 until his death.
The first county seat of Wahkaw County was the now-extinct village of Thompsonville; when the Legislature changed the county name to Woodbury, the new county seat became Sergeant's Bluff (now Sergeant Bluff). The county seat was moved to Sioux City in 1856.
The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska (Ho-Chunk) owns reservation land in Woodbury County.

== Politics ==
For much of the second half of the 20th century, Woodbury County tilted Republican, albeit not as overwhelmingly as most of western Iowa. Between 1988 and 2012 Woodbury County was the quintessential swing county in Iowa. No candidate won it by more than 3.5% over that quarter-century. This was the only county in Iowa that Barack Obama won in 2012 that he failed to carry in 2008. However, in 2016, Woodbury County swung over dramatically to Donald Trump, who carried it by a 19 percent margin, the largest margin of victory since Lyndon Johnson's landslide election in 1964.
