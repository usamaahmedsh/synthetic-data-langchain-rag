== Reception ==
The review by Nicolas Niarchos for The New York Times called the book "undeniably gripping", describing it as a "veritable harvest of slime, sycophancy and sleaze", painting Trump 2.0 as an aggrieved pugilist in a life-or-death campaign. Writing for The Guardian, Lloyd Green believed the author is simultaneously mesmerized and disdainful and found the book deeply personal—illuminating marital strife, inner-circle tensions, and personal animosities. Kirkus Reviews said the book was a "mordant, murkily sourced account of the 2024 election".
