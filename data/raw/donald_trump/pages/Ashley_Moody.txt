Ashley Brooke Moody (born March 28, 1975) is an American politician and attorney serving since 2025 as the junior United States senator from Florida. A member of the Republican Party, she previously served as the 38th attorney general of Florida from 2019 to 2025.
Born in Plant City, Florida, Moody received both her undergraduate degree and Juris Doctor from the University of Florida. She worked in civil litigation and then was an assistant U.S. attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida until she was elected  as a circuit court judge in Hillsborough County in 2006. She remained in the role until 2017, when she resigned to run for Florida attorney general. She won the 2018 election by the widest margin of any statewide race that year.
As Florida attorney general, Moody supported lawsuits to invalidate the Affordable Care Act and opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana. She supported then-President Donald Trump in Florida during the 2020 presidential election, and joined in the Texas v. Pennsylvania lawsuit, which sought to overturn the results of the election.
In January 2025, Governor Ron DeSantis appointed Moody to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Marco Rubio, who became United States secretary of state. On January 21, 2025, she was sworn in by Vice President JD Vance, becoming Florida's second female senator, after Paula Hawkins. Moody's appointment expires in January 2027; to remain in the Senate, she must win a special election in November 2026. She is running for a full term.

=== Elections ===
On April 28, 2017, Moody resigned from the court to run in the 2018 Florida attorney general election. In the Republican primary, she defeated state representative Frank White.

=== Tenure ===


==== Health care ====
Moody kept Florida in a lawsuit that seeks to have the Affordable Care Act deemed unconstitutional.


==== Marijuana ====
Moody argued for the disqualification of a 2022 ballot measure to legalize recreational cannabis in Florida, contending that it was misleading because the summary (which could not be longer than 75 words) did not clarify that cannabis would remain illegal under federal law. The Supreme Court of Florida agreed in a 5–2 ruling, effectively killing the initiative, which had already received 556,049 signatures of 891,589 required to appear on the ballot. Two months later, the court granted Moody's request that a second ballot measure to legalize recreational cannabis be disqualified from the 2022 ballot, in another 5–2 ruling that deemed the measure "affirmatively misleading".
In June 2023, Moody argued for the disqualification of a 2024 ballot measure to legalize recreational cannabis in Florida, filing a 49-page legal brief that asserted once again that the summary failed to make clear that cannabis would remain illegal under federal law, among other arguments. The challenge sought to strike down the initiative, which had received 967,528 of a required 891,523 valid signatures to appear on the ballot. The Florida Supreme Court ruled 5–2 that the initiative would remain on the ballot.


==== Voting rights ====
Moody opposed the restoration of voting rights for former felons. After the Voting Rights Restoration for Felons Initiative passed in 2018, she and Governor Ron DeSantis helped push a bill through the Florida Senate that would restore voting rights to eligible felons only once the felons had paid all their court fees. In 2020, after Michael Bloomberg raised $16 million to pay 32,000 felons' court fees, which would make them eligible to vote in the 2020 elections, Moody asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate Bloomberg, claiming he potentially violated election laws.


==== 2020 presidential election ====
During the 2020 United States presidential election, Politico called Moody "one of Donald Trump's biggest surrogates" in Florida. After Joe Biden won the election and Trump refused to concede, Moody took a leading role in aiding Trump's attempts to contest the election.
On December 9, 2020, Moody and 15 other state attorneys general announced their support for a lawsuit by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton asking the Supreme Court of the United States to invalidate the presidential election results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which were all won by Biden. There was no evidence of large-scale fraud in the election, and the court decided 7-2 not to hear the Texas lawsuit.
Moody was on the board of directors for the Rule of Law Defense Fund. In January 2021, the organization encouraged the gathering at the United States Capitol to call for a halt on the counting of the Electoral College ballots, which they contended were fraudulent. After the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, Moody removed any references to the Rule of Law Defense Fund from her online biography.


==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
In 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Moody sued the federal government and the CDC for instituting requirements that cruise ships require 95% of passengers to be fully vaccinated.


==== Abortion rights initiative ====
In January 2024, Moody petitioned the Florida Supreme Court to disqualify a ballot measure to expand abortion access, claiming its language could mislead voters. The measure remained on the ballot but failed to garner the necessary 60% of the vote to amend the Florida Constitution.


== U.S. Senate (2025–present) ==


=== Appointment ===
On January 16, 2025, Governor Ron DeSantis announced his intention to appoint Moody to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Marco Rubio, who was nominated to serve as Secretary of State (and subsequently unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate) in the second Trump administration. She is Florida's second female senator, after Paula Hawkins.


=== Senate tenure ===

Moody was sworn in on January 21, 2025, along with former Ohio lieutenant governor Jon Husted, by Vice President JD Vance. She was escorted by fellow Florida senator Rick Scott.
