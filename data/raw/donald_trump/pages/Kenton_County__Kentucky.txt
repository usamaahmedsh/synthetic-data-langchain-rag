This structure ensures a balance of executive and legislative authority, guiding Kenton County's development and public services.
The current Judge/Executive is Kris Knochelmann, while the three county commissioners are Beth Sewell (District 1), Jon Draud (District 2) and Joe Nienaber Jr. (District 3).
