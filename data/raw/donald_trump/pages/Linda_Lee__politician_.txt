== New York City council ==
Before running for New York City Council in 2021, she served as the President and CEO of Korean Community Services of Metropolitan New York, Inc.  She campaigned for election on a platform of increasing services for senior citizens, improving the accountability of police to citizens, and workforce training to help recover the economy in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
After winning the November 2021 general election, she became the first Asian American woman to represent the district, along with a wave of previously unrepresented minorities on the City Council. She succeeded fellow Democrat Barry Grodenchik; her term is intended to run for two years instead of the usual four because of planned redistricting. Her district office is located in Oakland Gardens, Queens. 
In December 2024, Lee voted against the "City of Yes" legislation which would rezone parts of the city to develop more housing.
