Bellerose  is a village in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 1,173 at the time of 2020 census.


== History ==
What is now the village was founded by Helen Marsh of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In 1907, planning to build a model community, Marsh purchased 77 acres (310,000 m2) of Floral Park gladiola fields. The first Bellerose home was completed, under Marsh's supervision, in 1910. Marsh persuaded the Long Island Rail Road to place a station in the new village, and she named the station Bellerose. Though it has been suggested that she named the station for the Rose farm – located to the south of the railroad – and her daughter Belle, she said that she simply found the name "euphonious". A vote of the homeowners made the name official in 1917.
Bellerose incorporated itself as a village in 1924 in order to gain and maintain home rule.
The Bellerose Village Hall, Fire House and Police Booth are on both the New York State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places; the complex is known as the Bellerose Village Municipal Complex.
