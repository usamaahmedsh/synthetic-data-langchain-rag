Glenwood Plantation is located in Maine's 2nd congressional district. Due to its low population, Glenwood Plantation only cast 2 votes in the 2016 presidential election, both of which for Republican nominee and winner Donald Trump. In the House of Representatives elections, it cast both of its votes for incumbent Republican representative Bruce Poliquin. Both ballots voted against legalizing marijuana and requiring background checks to purchase guns. However, they also voted in favor of instituting a surcharge of 3% on Maine income taxes for those with an annual income greater than $200,000 in order to fund public education, and in favor of raising the minimum wage to $12 an hour. The ballots were split on the issue of ranked choice voting. All of these initiatives, except for Question 3 (background checks), eventually passed.
