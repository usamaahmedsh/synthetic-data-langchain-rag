Crawford County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 16,525. Its county seat is Denison. The county was named for William Harris Crawford, U.S. senator from Georgia and United States Secretary of the Treasury.


== History ==
In January 1851, the Iowa Legislature authorized the creation of 50 additional counties in the state. Due to its lack of inhabitants, the designated Crawford County area was attached to Shelby County for purposes of revenue, taxation, and judicial matters.
In 1855 there were sufficient settlers, who petitioned for separation from Shelby. This was granted, and a county governing structure was established. The county as then designated did not include its present western townships.
In 1865, four eastern townships of Monona County were separated from that county and incorporated into Crawford County's boundary.
After several adjustments and reorganizations, the present arrangement of Crawford County townships was completed in June 1872.
