Carroll easily secured the Democratic nomination. He also won the nomination of the Working Families Party.

Carroll has written and co-sponsored several bills designed to help children with dyslexia. In 2020, Carroll wrote a bill that would enforce tests in schools that would help to screen young students for dyslexia. The Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity praised Carroll and the bill, calling the bill "groundbreaking news for all who care about [d]yslexia and the future of children who are [d]yslexic."
In 2019 Carroll worked with the Brooklyn Irish LGBTQ+ Organization (BILO) and the Irish American Parade Committee to allow for BILO to walk in the Brooklyn St. Patrick's Day Parade. This marked the first time an openly LGBTQ+ organization marched in the parade. Carroll's grandfather co-founded the parade in 1976. On the committee's decision, Carroll stated, "I am so glad that everyone was able to come together to honor Irish heritage and culture and make this the first fully inclusive St. Patrick's Day parade in Brooklyn."
Carroll has spoken in favor of building more affordable housing, but has opposed increases in housing supply in his own district. In 2024, he opposed a plan to build two 13-story residential buildings on the lot of a vacant factory building on Prospect Ave. The proposed buildings would provide 244 units (of which 20-30% were set aside for affordable housing) for more than 1,000 residents. Carroll has argued that more housing would lead to gentrification and displacement.
