The 2012 United States Senate election in Vermont was held on November 6, 2012. Incumbent independent Senator Bernie Sanders won reelection to a second term in a landslide, defeating Republican nominee John MacGovern with 71% of the vote and winning every county, municipality, and precinct. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, was first elected with 65% of the vote in 2006 and was the first non-Republican to win this seat since 1850.
