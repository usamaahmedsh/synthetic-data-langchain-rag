The county was created in 1791 north of the Mohawk River out of part of Montgomery County. It is named after General Nicholas Herkimer, who died from battle wounds in 1777 after taking part in the Battle of Oriskany during the Revolutionary War. The county is part of the Mohawk Valley region of the state.
Herkimer County is part of the Utica–Rome Metropolitan Statistical Area.


== History ==

In 1791, Herkimer County was created as one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being Otsego and Tioga counties) as New York State was developed after the American Revolutionary War. Its area was much larger than the present county, however, and was reduced subsequently as more counties were organized.
Part of Herkimer County was included in the Macomb's Purchase of 1791, during the wide-scale sale of public lands after the state forced Iroquois tribes allied with the British during the war to cede their territory. Suddenly the state was selling 5 million acres (20,000 km2) of land in upstate, central and western New York.
In 1794, Onondaga County was split off from Herkimer County. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, and included the present Cayuga, Cortland, and part of Oswego counties.
In 1798, portions of Herkimer and Tioga counties were taken to form Chenango County.
Another part of Herkimer was split off to form Oneida County. It was then larger than the current Oneida County, including the present Jefferson, Lewis, and part of Oswego counties.
In 1802, parts of Herkimer, Clinton and Montgomery counties were combined to form the new St. Lawrence County.
The rural economy was first based on general agriculture and then wheat, but after the opening of the Erie Canal, Herkimer farmers found that they could not compete with grain farmers to the west. By the mid-19th century, they had begun to specialize in dairy farming and created a cheese industry that supplied the New York City market, among others.
During the American Civil War, Herkimer contributed five companies to the 34th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, leading to the unit's nickname "The Herkimer Regiment".
The Herkimer County Jail, constructed in 1834, was used to hold the murderer Chester Gillette before his trial at the Herkimer County Courthouse. The jail is now disused, except for tours by the Herkimer County Historical Society.
The Herkimer County shootings took place in 2013, killing five people.

== Government and politics ==

Herkimer County is one of the most Republican counties in New York. Since 1884, it has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate only three times, with vote splitting due to a third-party candidate playing a role in two of those races. In the Trump era, the county's Republican tilt has increased, with the 2020 and 2024 elections being the strongest performance for the party there since Nixon's 1972 landslide. Since 2022, the entire county is within New York's 21st congressional district, presently held by Republican Elise Stefanik.
The Herkimer County Legislature consists of 17 members, each elected from single-member districts. As of 2023 the county legislature is almost entirely Republican: the single Democratic legislator also ran on the Conservative Party line.
In January 2025, the chairman of the Herkimer County Legislature took a plea deal settling charges from May 2024 of drug possession, an open-container law violation, and failing to safely store a firearm. On May 1, 2025, after being arrested for parole violation, he stepped down as chairman.
