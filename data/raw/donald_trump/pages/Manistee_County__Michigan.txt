== Government ==
The county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the major local courts, keeps files of deeds and mortgages, maintains vital records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and other social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget but has only limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.

== Politics ==
For most of the 20th century, Manistee County was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections, tending only to vote for Democrats in national landslides. One notable exception to this was in 1920, when it was the only county in Michigan to not vote for Warren G. Harding, though he only lost the county by just five votes and narrowly missed out on sweeping all of Michigan's counties. Beginning in 1992, the county saw a Democratic trend which lasted through 2012, with the exception of 2004, when incumbent Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry by 23 votes. In 2016 the county swung heavily Republican in support of Donald Trump, the best such performance since Reagan's 1984 landslide. In 2020 and 2024, the county continued to shift further into the Republican column.
