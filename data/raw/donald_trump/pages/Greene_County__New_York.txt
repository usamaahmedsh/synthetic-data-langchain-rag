== History ==

On March 25, 1800, Greene County was created by the partitioning of Albany (360 square miles) and Ulster (270 square miles) counties, producing a county of 630 square miles (1,600 km2).
On April 3, 1801, 90 square miles (230 km2) of land was transferred from Delaware and Ulster counties, raising the total area to 720 square miles (1,900 km2). This transferred Prattsville, Vly Mountain, Halcott Center, Bushnellsville, Highmount, Shandaken, Lanesville, and Pine Hill within Greene County.
On May 26, 1812, Greene County lost 20 square miles (52 km2) to Ulster County, lowering the total area to 690 square miles (1,800 km2), reassigning Pine Hill, Highmount, and Shandaken to Ulster County.
On April 15, 1814, the county borders were re-surveyed, and the line adjusted with no change in area.
On April 17, 1822, the border was again surveyed, with no change in area, but Palenville was found to be inside Greene County.
On April 23, 1823, the border was again resurveyed, and the Hudson River border with Columbia County realigned accordingly.
On March 3, 1836, 30 square miles (78 km2) of area was lost to Schoharie County, reducing the total area to 660 square miles (1,700 km2), and reassigning Manorkill, producing the Greene County that exists today.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 658 square miles (1,700 km2), of which 647 square miles (1,680 km2) is land and 11 square miles (28 km2) (1.7%) is water. Greene County is located in southeast central New York State, just west of the Hudson River and south of Albany.

For example, the highest elevation is Hunter Mountain, at approximately 4,040 feet (1,230 m) above sea level; In addition, there are many picturesque waterfalls in the park such as the famed, Kaaterskill Falls.
The entirety of Greene County is in the 19th Congressional District, and is represented by Democrat Josh Riley.
