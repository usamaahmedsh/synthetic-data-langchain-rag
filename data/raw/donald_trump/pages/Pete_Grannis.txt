In January 2007 he filed an application for consideration by the State Legislature for appointment as New York State Comptroller, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of Alan Hevesi.  He was one of 19 candidates for Comptroller.  Alan Chartock called him "One of the most qualified of the legislators" to be Comptroller, but due to "the matter of political balance [it] is tough to imagine either Spitzer or Silver giving the job to another Manhattan politician."
He interviewed with the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the search committee.  He withdrew his application for Comptroller after being nominated as Environmental Conservation Commissioner.


== Department of Environmental Conservation ==

Grannis was nominated by Governor Eliot Spitzer as DEC Commissioner on January 25, 2007.  He was confirmed on April 1, 2007 by the New York State Senate.
As Commissioner, Grannis managed hundreds of employees and represented the state government's ecological efforts.  He appointed Peter M. Iwanowicz, as director of a new Climate Change Office, on May 10, 2007.  He replaced some of the 
regional directors for DEC.  As part of his duties, he inspected polluted sites, such as Scajaquada Creek in western New York.  He had some administrative law duties, which included fining polluters; in July 2007, he assessed "Walter French $48,800 for [a] floating camp at Cranberry L[ake]"
Grannis was also Chairman and ex officio member of the board of the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation (EFC), a public benefit corporation which funds "programs that help New York State municipalities, agencies and businesses undertake projects ... to be environmentally responsible."


=== Firing ===
On October 21, 2010, he was fired from that position by Spitzer's successor, Governor David Paterson.  The firing came after a memo prepared by Grannis, detailing how the governor's proposed budget cuts would impair environmental protection in New York, was leaked to the press.


=== Reaction ===
Environmental activists unanimously reacted negatively to Grannis' firing.  A Sierra Club spokesman called his sacking "appalling". Rob Moore, director of Environmental Advocates, said "I think Gov. [sic] Paterson has been dismantling the agency for two years and he’s finally cut off its head."  Political commentator Alan Chartock opined that the governor "should have counted to 10 before firing Grannis" because of the deep respect that the public has for Grannis.  Robin Dropkin, director of Parks & Trails New York, called his "firing ... deeply unfortunate.  Mr. Grannis always has been a strong advocate for protecting New York's air, land and water."  Henry Stern, former New York City parks commissioner, called the dismissal of Grannis "a new low" and "so ridiculous that it is difficult to comprehend."
