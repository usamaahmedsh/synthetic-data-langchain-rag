The 2024 Green National Convention was a political event to select the Green Party of the United States nominees for president and vice president in the 2024 election. It was held on August 15–18, 2024, taking place as a virtual event. The party's delegates formally nominated Jill Stein as the party's presidential nominee and Butch Ware as her running mate.


== Nominating process ==
According to the Green Party, states have different methods of nominating candidates such as a primary or a nominating convention. The party's standing committee for nomination, the Presidential Campaign Support Committee (PCSC), list certain requirements to be a recognized candidate; when the requirements are met the PCSC will give the candidates support to get their names on primary and convention ballots. Recognition is not required to be a candidate for the Green Party's nomination. Once state primaries, caucuses, and conventions are complete, delegates vote to nominate a candidate for president and vice-president.
