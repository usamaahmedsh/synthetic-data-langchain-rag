== Politics ==

From its founding in 1885 until 1928, Forest County voted for the Republican candidate in all but three elections, voting for the Democratic candidate in 1892 and 1912, and voting for Progressive candidate and native Wisconsinite Robert M. La Follette in 1924. Then, from 1932 to 1996, the county voted Democratic in every election with the exception of four nationwide Republican landslides in 1952, 1956, 1972, and 1984. In 2000 and 2004, Forest County backed George W. Bush in both of his successful runs for the presidency, though doing so by less than 6% both times. The county shifted back to Democratic hands in 2008 and 2012, with Barack Obama taking the county in his two successful elections. However, since 2016, Forest County has shifted significantly to the right. In 2016, Donald Trump received over 61% of the vote in the county, the highest any candidate has received since 1964, winning by over 26% against Hillary Clinton. Trump further improved on his numbers in 2020, taking over 65% of the county's vote and winning by a margin of over 30% against Joe Biden. Trump yet again improved in the county in 2024, with more than 66% of the county's voters supporting him and more than doubling the support of Kamala Harris, turning in the best performance by a Republican in Forest County since Warren G. Harding more than a century earlier.
