== Politics ==
Henry County, like much of West Tennessee, was historically a Democratic stronghold and a center of Confederate sympathy during the Civil War, when it sent more than 2,500 men to the Confederate Army and earned the nickname "Volunteer County of the Volunteer State." After the war the county remained part of the Democratic "Solid South" well into the 20th century. Like much of Tennessee, however, it began to shift toward the Republican Party in the 2000s.
In 2004, George W. Bush flipped Henry County to the Republican column, and it has since become a Republican stronghold. Donald Trump in 2024 received over 77% of the vote.
