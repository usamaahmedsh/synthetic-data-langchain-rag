=== Activism ===
Castaneda is known for being outspoken about her Afro-Latina identity; she has been a proponent for addressing colorism and eurocentrism within the Latin community. She spoke out in support of Amara La Negra, who was criticised by another cast member for sporting an afro on the set of Love & Hip Hop: Miami. In 2018, she stated: 

We're Afro-Latinas, we're here to stay, and we have little girls looking up to us. [...] My Afro-Latina identity is such a huge part of who I am and I know Amara is the same way. I don’t ever want this industry to beat that out of her or any other young woman. [...] I want her to be proud and to embrace her identity, with whatever makes her comfortable and makes her feel beautiful.
In 2016, Castaneda established My Precious Jewels, a nonprofit organization to help adolescent girls with self-confidence and self-acceptance. In March 2019, she raised $200,000 to donate to an orphanage in Cuba.
