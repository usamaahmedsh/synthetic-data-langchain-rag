Our New President is a 2018 documentary produced by Third Party Films. It follows the story of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and is told entirely through footage from Russian state-sponsored media. Our New President is a satire about the Russian media and its take on American politics.
The film was originally made as an amateur short 12 minute collage of short clips from Russian media outlets and amateur clips by Russians for Field of Vision. It was subsequently expanded into a full-length documentary, showing how the Russian media (especially Russia 1, Russia Today and NTV) overhyped the election of Trump in a Russo-centric manner, falsified information leading common Russian people to behave irrationally.
