Wolfe County is a county located in the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,562. Its county seat is Campton. The county is named for Nathaniel Wolfe, one of the first two graduates of the University of Virginia School of Laws in 1829 and a loyal Unionist attorney for Jefferson County, Kentucky.

Wolfe County was formed on March 5, 1860, from portions of Breathitt County, Morgan County, Owsley County and Powell County. It was named for Nathaneal Wolfe, a member of the legislative assembly.
Campton, the county's seat was reportedly formed from camp town in Wolfe County. A small creek winding through Campton, Swift Creek, is named after Jonathan Swift of the legend of Swift's silver mine. Swift supposedly buried treasure in the area which has never been recovered.

== Politics ==

Wolfe County, like most of Eastern Kentucky, is historically Democratic; in every presidential election from its creation in 1860 until 1996, the county had an uninterrupted Democratic voting streak. In 2000, George W. Bush narrowly won the county and became the first Republican to do so, but the county still proved its Democratic loyalty by supporting John Kerry by a comfortable margin in the next election. However, the county has indeed drifted away from the Democrats at the presidential level as Mitt Romney won the county 60% to 38% in 2012, and Donald Trump with an even wider margin of 68% to 29%.
Wolfe remained reliably Democratic at the state level for some time after ceasing to favor the Democratic Party at the presidential level; it voted against Matt Bevin in both of his gubernatorial elections. Wolfe County has not voted for a Republican gubernatorial candidate since 1979 when it voted for Republican and former Governor Louie Nunn over Democrat John Y. Brown Jr. Along with nearby Elliott County, it was, until 2020, one of only two counties in Kentucky to have voted against Senator Mitch McConnell in each of his elections. In 2020, however, both counties voted for McConnell over his Democratic challenger, Amy McGrath.
