The 1992 United States House of Representatives election in Vermont was held on Tuesday, November 3, 1992, to elect the U.S. representative from the state's at-large congressional district. The election coincided with the elections of other federal and state offices, including a quadrennial presidential election and an election to the U.S. Senate.
Incumbent Independent Bernie Sanders would win re-election to a second term in Congress, defeating Republican Tim Philbin and Democrat Lewis Young.

=== Candidates ===
Tim Philbin, insurance agent
Ralph Sinclair, snack company owner (Withdrew, endorsed Philbin)
Jeff Wennberg, mayor of Rutland


=== Campaign ===
A total of three candidates made the ballot in the Republican primary, insurance agent Tim Philbin, Rutland mayor Jeff Wennberg, and Ralph Sinclair. Wennberg was considered a moderate Republican, backing abortion rights and tax increases on the rich, while Philbin and Sinclair were conservative Republicans who were opposed to abortion and any tax increases. Originally, Wennberg was considered the frontrunner in the primary, but in early September 1992 Sinclair, who had fallen into a distinct third place in the race, withdrew his candidacy and backed Philbin, which was viewed as potentially giving the latter the edge.

=== Campaign ===
As the campaign began Sanders and Philbin immediately began to attack each other in the press, with their sniping deemed by the Brattleboro Reformer as a "fax war". Sanders attacked Philbin for opposing abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, and championed his own record supporting abortion rights. Philbin responded by accusing Sanders of misrepresenting his position, and accused the incumbent of supporting "fat budgets and high taxes".
