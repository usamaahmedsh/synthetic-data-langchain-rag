Solomon "Sam" Sutton (born 1949) is an American nonprofit executive and politician serving as a member of the New York State Senate from the 22nd district. A Democrat, he won a May 2025 special election to succeed Simcha Felder, who resigned after being elected to the New York City Council.


== Career ==
Sutton served with the Sephardic Bikur Holim, a social service organization, for 30 years. He has also worked for the Sephardic Community Federation, New York Cancer Center, the Safe Foundation, and is a former trustee of the CUNY Board of Trustees as well as of the NYU Langone Medical Center.

== New York State Senate ==
Following Simcha Felder's resignation to join the New York City Council, the Brooklyn Democratic Party nominated Sutton as its nominee for the special election to fill the vacant seat. Although the district overwhelmingly voted for Republican President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, giving him 77% of the vote, it generally supports conservative and moderate Democrats at the local level, largely due to bloc voting from its Orthodox Jewish population Sutton defeated Republican and Conservative candidate Nachman Carl Caller in the May 20, 2025 election. His election makes him the first Sephardic Jew elected to the state senate.
He was sworn in on May 27, 2025. He was appointed chair of the Administrative Regulations Review Commission and is a member of the Aging, Disabilities, Education, Health, New York City Education, and Social Services committees.


== Personal life ==

Sutton is a Sephardic Jew and longtime community activist within New York's Sephardic community. He wears a kippah and keeps kosher.
