Bliss was born to James Francis Bliss, a dentist from Massachusetts, and Frieda Siemens. Her mother, a German emigrant, was a classically trained pianist and wanted her daughter to train as an opera singer. Her parents later divorced. Her father's death in 1935 prompted Frieda and Lucille to move to California, where her mother became head of the music department at the San Francisco College for Women.
