=== Elections ===


==== 2018 State Senate election ====
In 2018, Republican Senator Kathy Marchione announced that she would not seek reelection in Senate District 43 that fall. The announcement immediately put the seat into play as a competitive district. Following Marchione's retirement, Jordan announced that she would seek to succeed her.
Jordan described herself as pro-life and pro-Second Amendment. Jordan netted many endorsements running on a platform that she said would serve as a check and balance to Governor Andrew Cuomo and the powerful New York City Democrats. Jordan opposed sanctuary cities and free college for undocumented immigrants. Jordan defeated Democrat Aaron Gladd, 67,377 votes to 59,615 votes. Jordan’s election was a positive development for Republicans, especially in the Capital Region.


==== 2020 State Senate election ====
Jordan was re-elected to the State Senate in 2020, winning her race over Democratic challenger Patrick Nelson by a margin of 86,146 to 77,425.


==== 2022 State Senate election ====
In May 2022, following redistricting, Republican State Sen. Jim Tedisco announced his intent to move into the newly constituted 44th Senate District from his new 46th Senate District to challenge Jordan for the seat. This action caused controversy. On June 14, 2022, Jordan announced that she would not seek re-election to the Senate. Jordan accused Tedisco of "creating a 'circus atmosphere' in the campaign", commenting: "'I want no part of this sideshow. I’m not going to play a political game that would be destructive, divisive, and undermine the principles that I care deeply about'".
Jordan's name remained on the primary ballot, and she received nearly two thousand votes on the Republican line and almost one hundred votes on the Conservative line.
