Cimarron County is the westernmost county in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Its county seat is Boise City.  As of the 2020 census, its population was 2,296, making it the least-populous county in Oklahoma. Throughout most of its history, it has had both the smallest population and the lowest population density of any county in Oklahoma.  Located in the Oklahoma Panhandle, Cimarron County contains the only community in the state (Kenton) that observes the Mountain Time Zone. Black Mesa, the highest point in the state, is in the northwest corner of the county.   The Cimarron County community of Regnier has the distinction of being the driest spot in Oklahoma ranked by lowest annual average precipitation, at just 15.62 inches; at the same time, Boise City is the snowiest location in Oklahoma ranked by highest annual average snowfall, at 31.6 inches.


== History ==
Cimarron County was created at statehood in 1907. Before the Oklahoma Organic Act was passed in 1890, the area had belonged to what was known as "No-Man's Land", also referred to as the "Public Land Strip". This was a relatively lawless area, with no organized government, and several outlaws sought refuge within its borders. In 1890, the strip became known as Beaver County, Oklahoma Territory. Informally, it was known as the "Oklahoma Panhandle". Only two communities were in the strip. One, Carrizo (near present-day Kenton), had 83 residents in 1890, while the other, Mineral City, had 93 residents. Otherwise, the land was used primarily by sheepherders from New Mexico.
Several communities vied to become county seat after statehood: Boise City, Cimarron, Doby, Hurley, Willowbar, and Centerview. A county election in 1908 selected Boise City.
Railroads came late to this part of Oklahoma. The Elkhart and Santa Fe Railway built a line from Elkhart, Kansas, through Cimarron County in 1925. It completed the link into New Mexico in 1932. Service ended in 1942. The same company built a line from Colorado to Boise City in 1931 and extended it into Texas in 1937. This line still operates and in 2000 was part of the BNSF system.
Cimarron County was affected by the Dust Bowl and was the site of the iconic 1936 photo titled Farmer and Sons Walking in the Face of a Dust Storm.


== Geography ==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,841 square miles (4,770 km2), of which 6.1 sq mi (16 km2) (0.3%) are covered by water. It is the fourth-largest county in Oklahoma by area. It also has Oklahoma's highest point at 4,973 feet (1,516 m) above mean sea level on the Black Mesa.
The northern part of the county is drained by the Cimarron River, which flows eastward, then turns north into Kansas. The southern part is drained by the Beaver River (sometimes also called the North Canadian River). The human-made Lake Carl Etling lies inside Black Mesa Park.
The Boise City Airport (FAA ID: 17K) is about 3 miles north of town.

== Politics ==
Cimarron County is a solidly Republican county in presidential elections, and recently the most Republican county in the state of Oklahoma. It cast 92% of its votes for Donald Trump in the 2020 election and nearly the same in the 2024 election, the highest percentage of any Oklahoma county. The last Democrat to carry the county was Jimmy Carter in 1976, and no Democrat has even won 10% of the county’s vote since 2008.
A section of U.S. Route 287 in Oklahoma within the county was renamed President Donald Trump Highway after Trump left office. The Oklahoman newspaper reported in December 2021: "After altering rules and overcoming opposition to pass the state's highway naming bill in May, Oklahoma GOP legislators have yet to provide promised funding for signage along a 20-mile stretch of Panhandle highway designated 'President Donald J. Trump Highway.'"


== Economy ==
The county economy has been largely based on cattle ranching and agriculture throughout its history. Wheat and grain sorghum are the most important crops. The Dust Bowl devastated the county during the 1930s, and the deluges of 1942-1945 destroyed what was left; the economy had to be completely rebuilt. Oil and natural gas production became important in the 1960s, and a gas plant near Keyes began producing helium in 1959. In 2000, Cimarron County had the ninth-highest per capita income of all Oklahoma counties.
