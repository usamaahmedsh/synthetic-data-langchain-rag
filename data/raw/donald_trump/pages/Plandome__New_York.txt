Plandome is a village in the Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. It is one of the three villages which comprise the area of Cow Neck known as the Plandomes – and it is also considered part of the Greater Manhasset area, which is anchored by Manhasset. The population was 1,448 at the time of the 2020 census.
The Incorporated Village of Plandome was ranked fifth on Forbes' 10 most affluent U.S. communities list in 2009.


== History ==


=== Pre-incorporation (pre-colonization – 1910) ===
The location of what is now the Village of Plandome was originally inhabited by Matinecock Native Americans. These Native American inhabitants called the area Sint Sink, meaning "place of small stones."
During the 17th century, Dutch and English colonists began to settle the area, with fishing in Manhasset Bay and farming serving as a major industries. In 1623, Cow Neck was claimed by the Dutch West India Company, and they began forcing English settlers to leave in 1640. A land purchase in 1643 made it possible for English settlers to return to Cow Neck. This era saw members of prominent colonial families settle on the peninsula, including members of the Mitchill, Nicolls, and Willets families. The Mitchill family, which settled in the area in 1694, owned a significant portion of the land which would eventually become the village – as did the George Willets, of the Willets family, which has long had a large presence on Cow Neck and across Long Island.
The Great Neck and Port Washington Railroad, a subsidiary of the Long Island Rail Road, built what is today known as the Port Washington Branch through the community in 1898; Plandome became a flag stop until the opening of the permanent Plandome station in 1909. This new station would also house the community's U.S. Post Office, which would service all portions of what are now  the Village of Plandome and Village of Plandome Manor, in addition to a portion of what is now the Village of Flower Hill.
During the first few years of the 20th century, four friends, all young men residing in New York City, purchased approximately 90 acres (36 ha) of the property owned by the Mitchill family. They founded the Plandome Land Company, through which they subsequently developed vast swaths of the land with single-family homes, centered around Plandome Village Green and a large Tudor building which would eventually become Plandome Village Hall.


=== Village of Plandome (1911 – present) ===
The Village of Plandome was incorporated in 1911 as the Plandome Land Company began to develop land, though some homes, farmhouses, and mills had been built in the area in prior decades. 
In 1913, the village established the Plandome Fire Department, a municipal fire department exclusively serving the village.
In the 1930s, Plandome's municipal water supply system was established, as part of a New Deal-funded public works project. Construction started in 1934 and was completed in 1935. 
In 1943, the Plandome Post Office, which had operated as an independent branch up until that point, merged with the Manhasset Post Office. As part of the merger, the Plandome Post Office would continue to operate but it would be reclassified as a branch of the Manhasset Post Office, thereby allowing the facility to remain in operation while enabling the residents of Plandome to receive home delivery services from the post office.
In January 1987, the original Plandome LIRR station house and the Plandome Post Office within it burned down in an arson attack executed by vandals. It was rebuilt, in addition to having its platform lengthened and refurbished, by 1990. The Plandome Post Office was also rebuilt within the structure, this time in its own, dedicated space on the ground floor, beneath the station's waiting room.

In the early 1990s, the Reconstructionist Synagogue of the North Shore moved to Plandome from nearby Roslyn Estates; it moved to a property formerly owned and utilized by the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the North Shore – which itself was moving to a new location off Shelter Rock Road in Manhasset – as a church.
The Village of Plandome celebrated its centennial in 2011.
In 2019, former Village Trustee Thomas S. Minutillo was elected as Mayor of Plandome through a write-in campaign. He was succeeded by former village trustee John "Jake" Kurkjian in 2023.
In 2022, the village built a memorial garden to its victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. This memorial garden includes large clock, and is located adjacent to Plandome Village Hall.
