== Role in passage of the Georgia Indigent Defense Act ==
In 2001, Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Benham convened a committee to investigate indigent defense in the state of Georgia. An avalanche of complaints about the state of public defense in Greene County, along with a number of lawsuits filed by Stephen Bright and the Southern Center for Human Rights, contributed to the formation of this commission. The commission discovered during its investigation that indigent defendants in Greene County were routinely pleaded guilty by judges without the presence of counsel and sometimes without even being present in court to make their pleas, violations of the Sixth Amendment. Excessive bail, e.g. $50,000 for loitering, was often set as well, a violation of the Eighth Amendment. After two years of investigation, the committee's recommendations led to the passage of the Georgia Indigent Defense Act.


== Politics ==
Prior to 2000, the only time Greene County failed to back a Democratic Party candidate in a presidential election was in 1972, when Richard Nixon won every county in Georgia and all but 130 counties nationwide. From 2000 onward, it has been consistently Republican due to the growth of white residents moving to Reynolds Lake Oconee.
As of the 2020s, Greene County is a strongly Republican voting county, voting 64% for Donald Trump in 2024. For elections to the United States House of Representatives, Greene County is part of Georgia's 10th congressional district, currently represented by Mike Collins. For elections to the Georgia State Senate, Greene County is part of District 24. For elections to the Georgia House of Representatives, Greene County is part of District 124.
