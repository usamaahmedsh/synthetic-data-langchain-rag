The 2006 United States Senate election in Vermont was held November 7, 2006. Incumbent independent Senator Jim Jeffords decided to retire rather than seek reelection to a fourth term, and Bernie Sanders was elected to succeed him.
Sanders, who represented Vermont's at-large House district as an independent, won the Democratic primary, and then dropped out to run as an independent. Many Democratic politicians across the country endorsed him, and no Democrat was on the ballot. The state committee of the Vermont Democratic Party voted unanimously to endorse Sanders.
Sanders won the seat with 65% of the vote. His win marked the first Republican loss in an election for this Class 1 seat since 1850, decisively ending the longest single-party Senate winning streak in history. (Vermont's Class 3 seat had been held by Democrat Patrick Leahy since 1974, the first time a Republican had lost any Senate election in the state since 1850.)


== Democratic primary ==
After Jeffords retired, there was brief speculation that DNC chair Howard Dean, a former governor and 2004 presidential candidate, would run for Senate. After Dean quickly issued a statement that he would not run, independent Representative Bernie Sanders became the subject of media attention, and ultimately entered and won the race.


=== Candidates ===


==== Declared ====
Larry Drown, retired plumber and perennial candidate
Peter D. Moss, retired chemical engineer
Louis W. Thabault, former postal worker
Bernie Sanders, U.S. Representative and Liberty Union nominee for U.S. Senate in 1972


==== Declined ====
Howard Dean, former Governor of Vermont, chair of the Democratic National Committee
Doug Racine, former Lieutenant Governor of Vermont


=== Results ===
Sanders won the Democratic primary, but declined the nomination, leaving no Democratic nominee on the ballot. This victory ensured that no Democrat would appear on the general election ballot to split the vote with Sanders, an ally of the Democrats who had been supported by leaders in the Democratic Party.


== Republican primary ==
National Republicans pressured Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie to enter the race, and he formed an exploratory committee to do so, but the committee raised little money and Dubie opted not to run. Governor Jim Douglas also declined to run.
Businessman Richard Tarrant announced his campaign in October 2005. Tarrant largely self-funded his campaign, and frequently denounced political partisanship.


=== Candidates ===
Cris Ericson, perennial candidate and marijuana legalization activist
Greg Parke, retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel and nominee for VT-AL in 2004
Richard Tarrant, businessman

Jim Douglas, governor of Vermont

=== Campaign ===
In mid-August 2006, the campaign heated up considerably, with Tarrant fully engaged in heavy media advertising, most of which criticized Sanders's public stances. Tarrant ran several ads accusing Sanders of representing himself differently from his voting record in the House of Representatives, citing such examples as Sanders's votes against Amber alert and against increased penalties for child pornography. Sanders responded with an ad stating that Tarrant's claims were "dishonest" and "distort my record", and presented what he viewed as more accurate explanations of his voting record.
Tarrant also claimed that Sanders's election would lead to an exodus of businesses from Vermont. Sanders based his campaign on a well-tested message of fixing economic inequality, and ran a positive campaign that took advantage of his high name recognition in the state.

=== Fund-raising ===
The election was the most expensive political campaign in Vermont history.

Sanders raised $5,554,466 total. In total, Tarrant and Sanders spent $13,771,060. Tarrant spent $85 per vote, the largest cost per vote of any race in the country during 2006, while Sanders spent $34 per vote.
