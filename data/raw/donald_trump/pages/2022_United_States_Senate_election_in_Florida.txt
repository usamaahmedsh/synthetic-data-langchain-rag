The 2022 United States Senate election in Florida was held on November 8, 2022, to elect a member of the United States Senate to represent the state of Florida. Incumbent Republican Senator Marco Rubio won re-election to a third term, defeating Democratic nominee Val Demings in a landslide victory. Rubio was first elected in 2010, filling the seat of appointed Senator George LeMieux. Rubio won re-election to a third term, becoming the first Republican to do so in Florida history. Rubio was sworn in for what would be his last term in the Senate, serving from January 3, 2023, to January 21, 2025, when he assumed the office of United States Secretary of State in the second Trump administration.
The primary elections for Republicans and Democrats took place on August 23 to finalize candidates for the November election. Rubio won the uncontested Republican primary, while incumbent U.S. Representative Val Demings won the Democratic nomination.
Despite some predicting a close race early, Rubio went on to win by a comfortable 16.4%, improving upon his 2016 performance by 8.7%. According to exit polls, Rubio won 64% of White voters, 56% of Latino voters, and 9% of African American voters (down from 17% from 2016).
Demings' 41.27% share of the vote was the worst performance for a Democrat in a Senate race in Florida since 1994.
