Morgan County was formed in 1817 from portions of Anderson and Roane counties. It was named in honor of Daniel Morgan (1736–1802), an American Revolutionary War officer who commanded the troops that defeated the British at the Battle of Cowpens, and who later served as a U.S. congressman from Virginia. The county had been part of lands relinquished by the Cherokee with the signing of the Third Treaty of Tellico in 1805. The original county seat was Montgomery until 1870, when it was moved to Wartburg.

== Politics ==
Morgan County, in line with much of East Tennessee, has historically supported the Republican Party. The county opposed secession during the Civil War and maintained strong Unionist sentiment, which translated into long-term Republican loyalty. Since the late 19th century, Republicans have carried Morgan County in nearly every presidential election, with Democrats only occasionally winning the county in the 20th century. In the 21st century, the county has become increasingly Republican after voting for Bill Clinton in the 1990s. In 2024, Donald Trump received 86.8% of the vote.
