== Politics ==
From its inaugural election in 1860 through 1928, Worth County backed the Republican candidate in every election with the exception of 1912, when former Republican Theodore Roosevelt won as the Progressive candidate. From 1932 to 1980, the county was a bellwether, backing the nationwide winner in every election in that span except for 1960. For the next eight elections, Worth County favored the Democratic nominee in every election, each time by a margin of at least 10% except for 1984. In 2016, the county shifted back to the right, with Donald Trump winning nearly 58% of the vote in Worth County with a margin of victory of almost 22%. He improved on this in 2020, taking almost 62% of the vote and winning by a margin of victory of nearly 26%, the best performance by any candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, the best performance by a Republican since Herbert Hoover in 1928, and the best margin of victory for any candidate since 1928 as well.
