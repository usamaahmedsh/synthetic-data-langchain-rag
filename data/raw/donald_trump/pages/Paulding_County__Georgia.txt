== History ==
Paulding County was created from Cherokee County by an act of the Georgia General Assembly on December 3, 1832. In 1851, a portion of Paulding County was used to help create Polk County. Other portions of Paulding County were annexed to neighboring counties (Campbell, Carroll, Cobb, Douglas, Haralson, and Polk) between 1832 and 1874. Between 1850 and 1874, Paulding County was expanded through annexation of parts of Carroll, Cobb, Douglas, and Polk counties.
The county is named after John Paulding (October 16, 1758 – February 18, 1818), who was famous for the capture of the British spy Major John André in 1780 during the American Revolution.  André was on a mission carrying secret papers from Benedict Arnold when he was captured.

== 2022 police body-slamming incident ==

On March 4, 2022, at approximately 6:00 a.m., 25-year-old Deputy Michael McMaster of the Paulding County Sheriff’s Office responded to a report of a suspicious person, who was wearing a hoodie and a backpack, attempting to break into a vehicle in the Evans Mill Subdivision. A short time later, Deputy McMaster arrived at the location and observed 30-year-old Tyler Lee Canaris walking along the roadside at the entrance to the subdivision. Canaris, who was wearing a hoodie and a backpack, appeared to match the description of the suspect that was provided by dispatch. Deputy McMaster then approached Canaris who he claimed to have refused to comply with the Deputy’s commands to remove his backpack and place his hands behind his back.
Thereafter, Deputy McMaster used force to bring Canaris to the ground and placed him under arrest. Once arrested, Canaris was evaluated on the scene by medical personnel. Canaris was then transported to the hospital by the Sheriff’s Office for medical evaluation. Sheriff's officials say it was later determined that Canaris was not breaking into cars, but he was charged with Obstruction of Justice. Soon after, the attorneys for Canaris accused the Paulding County deputy of leaving their client with $75,000 worth of medical bills from fractured bones and a ruptured eardrum. Prior to the incident, Deputy McMaster already had 10 reprimands, and was advised to undergo anger management counseling.
The Paulding County Sheriff’s Office initially refused to release the dash-cam footage that captured the incident to the public, however some of the footage was later leaked by Canaris' lawyers in early 2023, which led to Canaris being charged with Obstruction of Justice a second time. The Sheriff's Office would release the full dash-cam footage a week later. On September 22, 2023, Canaris would file a lawsuit against McMaster and the Sheriff's Office. Due to the backlash the dash-cam video would receive online, McMaster would eventually be fired from the Paulding County Sheriff’s Office and would end up on the Brady List as a result.
