The 2024 Green Party presidential primaries and caucuses are a series of electoral contests to elect delegates to the 2024 Green National Convention who will choose the Green Party's presidential nominee in the 2024 presidential election. The convention was held as a virtual event from August 15 to 18, 2024.


== Background ==
The Green Party has run candidates for president in every election since 1996. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader was the party's nominee in 1996 and 2000. Political activist David Cobb was nominated in 2004; former U.S. congresswoman Cynthia McKinney was the nominee in 2008; physician and activist Jill Stein was nominated in 2012 and 2016; and activist Howie Hawkins was the Green nominee in 2020. Nader's 2.7% in 2000 remains the largest percentage of the vote any Green Party presidential candidate has won.
