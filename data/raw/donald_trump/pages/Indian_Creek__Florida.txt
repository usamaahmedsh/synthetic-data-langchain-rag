Indian Creek is a village, gated community, and man-made barrier island in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It has 41 residential home sites and the Indian Creek Country Club which takes up most of the land on the island. The village is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The concentration of highly affluent people on the island has earned it the nickname "Billionaire Bunker". The population was 84 at the 2020 census. The village has its own government and law enforcement.


== History ==
The island of Indian Creek was said to have been created in the 1900s, due to excavation of drainage for Biscayne Bay and was an uninhabited and underdeveloped mangrove forest until 1928, when the country club and housing lots were established after a group of Midwestern businessmen bought the island as a real estate venture. The Village of Indian Creek was an unincorporated area until it was incorporated by an act of the Florida Legislature on May 17, 1939, at which point the island had 17 residents and the country club had 180 members. For many years, the island served as a space for vacation rentals for the Miami-area elite, until recent years when elite residents from outside the area began living there full-time.
