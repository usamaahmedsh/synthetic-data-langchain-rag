He was chairman of the board of Corning Glass Works (1941–1961). In 1959 he was elected as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.


== Early life ==
Houghton was born on July 27, 1899, in Corning, New York.  He was the only son of four children born to Adelaide Louise (née Wellington) Houghton and Alanson B. Houghton, who served as a United States representative from New York, as well as the U.S. ambassador to Germany and Great Britain. His second cousin was actress Katharine Hepburn.
He was educated at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and graduated from Harvard University in 1921.


== Career ==
After graduating from Harvard, Houghton began work in the blowing room of B Factory at Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated) in 1921.  In 1926, he became assistant to the president and two years later was elected executive vice-president.
In 1930, he became president and at the death of his father in 1941 chairman of the board. After leaving this position in 1961 he went on to serve as chairman of the executive committee from 1961 to 1964. He was then named chairman of the board again from 1964 to 1971.
Houghton served as a director of the National City Bank of New York (now Citibank), the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (now MetLife), and the Erie Railroad.  He was also on the Harvard Board of Overseers, was a trustee of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey, and was a trustee of Eisenhower College in Seneca Falls, New York.


=== Public service ===
Houghton began his career in government as a dollar-a-year man in 1941 when he was appointed assistant deputy director of the materials division in the Office of Production Management. An account cited that it was businessman Philip D. Reed who recruited him to the OPM. In this position, Houghton served as the liaison between the government and American manufacturers. It was reported that he was responsible for surmounting almost half the burden of the then production crisis.
In January 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt replaced the Office and Supply Priorities and Allocations Board with the War Production Board and Houghton was appointed deputy chief of the bureau of industry branches. By August of the same year, he resigned and did not serve any government position after a Hartford-Empire, subsidiary of Corning, faced an antitrust suit. He was also accused of monopolistic behavior and this particular case reached the Supreme Court.
From 1943 to 1944, he was appointed as the chief mission officer for the Lend-Lease Administration, a program by which the United States supplied the Allied nations with food, oil, warships, warplanes, and with other weaponry during World War II.  He was forced to resign in 1943 due to antitrust problems with a Corning subsidiary.
On March 14, 1957, he was appointed the United States ambassador to France  by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  He presented his credentials on April 17, 1957, and served until he left his post on January 19, 1961, shortly before President Kennedy took office.

Houghton received the Silver Buffalo Award in 1945 and served as the  national president of the Boy Scouts of America from 1946 to 1951.
