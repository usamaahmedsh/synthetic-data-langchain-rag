== Career ==
Goldberg began his career in broadcast meteorology as a private weather forecaster, where he reported for utilities and ski areas. He also worked as a weather agent in Canada and the United States at the same time. 
He earned his B.S. in meteorology at Cornell University in 1994. At this time, he interned at WCVB-TV and WHDH-TV, both in Boston. He began his career at WTVH-TV in Syracuse, New York, starting just in time to cover the infamous Blizzard of 1993, which heavily impacted central New York. He was hired full-time after graduating from college. He remained there for two years, long enough to report on the winter of 1995-1996 that buried Syracuse in more than 15 feet of snow.
On July 23, 1996, Goldberg appeared on Good Morning America, as a substitute for Sam Champion, whom Goldberg replaced at WABC-TV in 2006.  Since September 28, 1996, he has appeared in the local broadcasts, formerly as the station's weekend forecaster.
