He also supported limiting PAC and corporate campaign contributions to reduce the influence of special interest money in campaigns, as well as spending caps on state level campaigns to provide a level political playing field.[4]

He was also an advocate of changing the state public school aid formula [6], as well as better pay for teachers [7] and smaller class sizes [8]. In 2007, he participated in negotiating an agreement to build the City's first ever green school in Battery Park City [9].

He is an opponent of the death penalty[15] but supported proposals to toughen gun laws [16] and increase penalties for hate crimes [17].


== Senate Leadership ==
Connor served for eight years as minority leader of the Senate until he was defeated for the position in 2002 by Sen. David Paterson, who went on to become Governor of New York.


== 2006 Campaign ==
In 2006, Senator Connor was opposed in the Democratic primary by Ken Diamondstone, a developer of affordable housing [18]; it was the most serious race the 25th District had seen in years.  A key issue in the campaign was Diamondstone's opposition to Brooklyn Bridge Park, a project that Senator Connor supported [19].  Senator Connor won the race with more than 55% of the vote [20].


== Comptroller Candidacy ==
In early 2007 he was among at least 18 candidates for New York State Comptroller, in a special contest decided by the State Legislature [21].  Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli won the race.


== 2008 Campaign ==
In 2008, Senator Connor was opposed in the Democratic primary by Dan Squadron, a former aide to US Senator Chuck Schumer.  Connor had been endorsed by Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, and a number of his fellow state senators and members of Congress [22].  Squadron had been endorsed by Schumer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Congressman Anthony Weiner, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, the New York Times and the Working Families Party[23].
A debate, sponsored by the Citizens Union, occurred on Sept. 3. Following the debate, the Citizens Union announced  that it had decided to prefer the incumbent, Connor, over his challenger, stating that Connor "would undeniably be in a stronger and more experienced position to effectively advance critical reforms."
Connor lost the 2008 primary to challenger Dan Squadron, who received approximately 54% of the vote.


== Post-senatorial career ==
A longtime election lawyer by trade, Connor began to practice election law full time after leaving the senate.
 He is considered one of the "top" attorneys in this field, and has represented candidates at every level of government, from local, state, and congressional races, to presidential campaigns.
