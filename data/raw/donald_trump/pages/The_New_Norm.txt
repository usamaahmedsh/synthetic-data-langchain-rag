== Reception ==
Writing for UnHerd, Gareth Roberts praised the "well designed" characters and "decent voice performances", but otherwise criticised the show, saying "it is not just terrible but flesh-creepingly awful. The jokes, such as they are, all crash like bags of tools being dropped down a lift shaft". He would also go on to criticize the "cringe-inducing" homage to X (Twitter) owner Elon Musk, and described the show as "like a progressive's idea of what conservative humour might be".
Jacob Weindling of Splinter called it "bigoted babybrained bullshit" and "a perfect window into the low-grade conservative comedian mind".
