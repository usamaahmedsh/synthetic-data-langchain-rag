Arapahoe County ( ə-RAP-ə-hoh) is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, its population was 655,070, making it the third-most populous county in Colorado. The county seat is Littleton, and the most populous city is Aurora. The county was named for the Arapaho Native American tribe, who once lived in the region. Arapahoe County is part of the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood metropolitan statistical area. Arapahoe County calls itself "Colorado's First County", since its origins antedate the Pike's Peak Gold Rush.


== History ==
On August 25, 1855, the Kansas Territorial Legislature created a huge Arapahoe County to govern the entire western portion of the Territory of Kansas. The county was named for the Arapaho Nation, who lived in the region.
In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County (in present-day Englewood). This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. The following month, the Jefferson Territorial Legislature organized 12 counties for the new territory, including a smaller Arapahoe County. Denver City served as the county seat of Arapahoe County.
The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, and when the State of Kansas was admitted to the Union on January 29, 1861, the mining regions temporarily reverted to unorganized territory. On February 28, 1861, Congress passed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado, using present-day borders. On November 1, 1861, the Colorado Territorial Assembly organized the 17 original counties of Colorado, including a new Arapahoe County. Arapahoe County originally stretched from the line of present-day Sheridan Boulevard 160 miles (260 km) east to the Kansas border, and from the line of present-day County Line Road 30 miles (48 km) north to the 40th parallel north (168th Avenue). Denver City served as the county seat of Arapahoe County until 1902.
In 1901, the Colorado General Assembly voted to split Arapahoe County into three parts - a new consolidated City and County of Denver, a new Adams County, and the remainder of the Arapahoe County to be renamed South Arapahoe County. A ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court, subsequent legislation, and a referendum delayed the reorganization until November 15, 1902. Governor James Bradley Orman designated Littleton as the temporary county seat of South Arapahoe County. On April 11, 1903, the Colorado General Assembly changed the name of South Arapahoe County back to Arapahoe County. On November 8, 1904, Arapahoe County voters chose Littleton over Englewood by a vote of 1310 to 829 to be the permanent county seat.

The county is also home to the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and the Denver South campus of Colorado Technical University, both located in Aurora.


== Politics ==
Arapahoe County was once a classic bastion of suburban conservatism. In the 1924 Colorado gubernatorial election, Republican Clarence Morley, who was openly affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan, won over 66% of the vote in Arapahoe County, a higher percentage than he received in any other county in Colorado.  In addition, the county for many years was represented in congress by Republican Tom Tancredo, a hardcore conservative known for his controversial anti-immigration, anti-Catholic, and nativist political beliefs.
As the Denver Metro Area grew in the 1960s and beyond, Arapahoe County became the most Republican county in the state outside of Colorado Springs. However, heavy urbanization, demographic changes and population increases - such as the rapid diversification of Aurora's population and younger professionals in the southern suburbs - have caused the county to become much more competitive since the 1990s. It swung from a 22-point win for George H. W. Bush in 1988 to only a three-point win in 1992. By the turn of the millennium, it had become more of a suburban swing county. In 2008, the county swung over dramatically to support Barack Obama, who became the first Democrat to carry it since 1964, and only the second since 1936. It swung from a four-point win for George W. Bush in 2004 to a 13-point win for Obama in 2008. It voted for Obama by a similar margin in 2012, and provided much of Hillary Clinton's statewide margin in 2016 as Donald Trump failed to win even 40 percent of the vote in one of the worst showings for a Republican in the county's history, with the Democrats carrying the former Tech Center area Republican strongholds of Centennial and Littleton. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden turned in the strongest showing for a Democrat in over a century, becoming the first Democrat to win over 60% of the vote since 1916. Biden carried Aurora by lopsided margins and the traditionally Republican southern parts of the county by nearly 20 points: as a reflection of changing demographics and voter coalitions, Arapahoe is now the strongest suburban county for the Democrats in the Denver metro area while Republicans have gained ground in traditionally-democratic Adams County.
Federal Representation
The bulk of the population and political strength of Arapahoe County is located in Colorado's 6th congressional district, Tancredo's former district, centered in Aurora and represented by Jason Crow. The more rural eastern parts of the county are located in the 4th District represented by Lauren Boebert while the Denver enclave portions such as Glendale and Holly Hills are in the Denver-based 1st District represented by Diana DeGette.
