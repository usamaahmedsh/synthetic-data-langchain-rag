== History ==

In 1838, Fulton County was split off from Montgomery, shortly after the Montgomery county seat was moved to Fonda, New York. The creation of Fulton County was engineered by Johnstown lawyer Daniel Cady, whose wife was a cousin of Robert Fulton. Fulton County was formed on April 18, 1838, by a partition of Montgomery County, resulting in a county with an area of 550 square miles (1,400 km2).
The old Tryon County courthouse, built in 1772, later the Montgomery County courthouse, became the Fulton County Courthouse, where it is New York's oldest operating courthouse. One adjustment has been made to the area of Fulton County. On April 6, 1860, 10 square miles (26 km2) on the northern border was transferred to Hamilton in the vicinity of Sacandaga Park. That resulted in the Fulton County which exists today.
In the mid-18th century, Sir William Johnson, founder of Fort Johnson in Montgomery County and of Johnstown, arrived in what would become Fulton County. Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, was an Irish pioneer and army officer in colonial New York, and the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs from 1755 to 1774. His homes, Fort Johnson and Johnson Hall are New York State Historic Sites. Fulton County was also home to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a central pioneer in America's women's rights movement.
Shortly after the American Revolutionary War, the manufacture of gloves and leather became the area's primary industry. At one point, Johnstown and Gloversville were known as the world's Glove and Leather capital. The largest rise in population and growth came as a result of the fruits of these businesses.
Many residents of Fulton County can trace their ancestry to the glove and leather trades. Today few glovers, tanners, and leather dressers remain in the area, although some companies have adapted to the changes in the market to remain competitive.
