== History ==
Cheatham County was created by the Tennessee General Assembly act in 1856, from lands formerly of Davidson, Dickson, Montgomery, and Robertson counties. Cheatham County was named for Edward Saunders Cheatham, a state legislator. It is also possible that Cheatham County was also named for native middle Tennessean and Confederate general Benjamin F. Cheatham, a relative of Edward Saunders Cheatham.


== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 307 square miles (800 km2), of which 302 square miles (780 km2) is land and 4.6 square miles (12 km2) (1.5%) is water.
The county is bisected from northwest to southeast by the Cumberland River, with Ashland City on its northern bank. The southern portion of the county is bisected from southeast to northwest by the Harpeth River, which meanders through generally hilly country, and along whose course are located the communities of Kingston Springs, largely to the north of I-40, and Pegram, along U.S. Route 70 (US 70). The western border of the central portion of the county is defined by the course of the Harpeth. The hills east of the Harpeth and south of the Cumberland are partly set aside by the state as the Cheatham State Wildlife Management Area. North of Ashland City the hills subside into more level highlands, where the community of Pleasant View is located just south of I-24, which generally delineates the  county's northern border.

=== Political History ===
Cheatham County was historically a "Solid South" Democratic stronghold, like much of Middle Tennessee, consistently supporting Democratic presidential candidates through much of the 20th century and even supporting segregationist George Wallace in 1968. Republican candidates began gaining traction near the final quarter of the century, with Richard Nixon carrying the county in 1972 for the first time in recent memory. After 1972, Democrats carried the county through the later 1970s and into the 1990s, although it supported Republicans Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George H. W. Bush in 1988.
In 2000, Cheatham County began solidifying as a Republican stronghold, when George W. Bush carried it over native Tennessean Al Gore. Since then, the county has voted reliably Republican in every presidential election, with Donald Trump surpassing 70% of the vote in 2016, and Democrats have not approached one-third of the county's vote share since. The last time Cheatham County voted for a Democratic candidate in a statewide race was for Phil Bredesen in 2006, and the last time it voted for a Democratic candidate on a presidential level, was for Bill Clinton in 1996.
