The battery theory is the fringe belief that human beings are born with only a finite amount of energy, which is depleted by physical activity. Persons who subscribe to the battery theory avoid exercising whenever possible, in the belief that it would cause them to die sooner. Mainstream medical science rejects this view.
U. S. President Donald Trump has been widely reported as subscribing to this view, which is why he avoids most forms of exercise apart from golf. Trump once told an interviewer that all of his friends who worked out ended up getting knee and hip replacements.
