Black Ben Carson (stylized in all lowercase) is the debut studio album by American rapper JPEGMafia. It was self-released on February 15, 2016. The album was supported by the three singles "You Think You Know", "I Smell Crack" and "Digital Blackface". Black Ben Carson was named after the most prominent Black candidate in the 2016 US presidential election, Ben Carson, who was running as a Republican.
The album was split into two sides; Side A being "hip hop in its rawest form – loud, angry, political, and self-aware" and Side B with a more introspective, mellow and calm sound.
The tracklist was later changed to single disc consisting of 19 tracks.
Black Ben Carson was named the best Baltimore album of 2016 by the Baltimore City Paper.
