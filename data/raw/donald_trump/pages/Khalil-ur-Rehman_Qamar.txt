== Controversies ==


=== Feminism and sexism ===
On 3 March 2020, Qamar appeared on a Pakistani talk show on Neo News to discuss the Aurat March. When Qamar was speaking, Marvi Sirmed interrupted Qamar by shouting "Mera Jism Meri Marzi" (meaning "My Body, My Choice"), a feminist slogan. He made obscene remarks about Marvi’s body and also indulged in abusive name-calling towards her. Qamar was accused of sexism and heavily criticized by politicians and prominent figures, while Geo TV suspended his contract. Qamar said he had not interrupted when Sirmed was speaking, but she interrupted him.


=== Abduction case ===
On 15 July 2024, Qamar was abducted when he went to meet a woman supposedly pretending to be his fan who had allegedly invited him out, very early in the morning around 4:40am. His belongings were taken and a ransom was demanded. During this ordeal, the suspects filmed compromising and explicit videos of Qamar. When he refused to pay further extortion money, these videos were leaked online. The leaked footage shows Qamar with the woman who lured him as well as scenes of the video setup by the woman's accomplices. Some Pakistanis called the abduction "poetic justice", saying that he was not abducted by men, but by women.
Qamar later filed a complaint with FIA's Cyber Crime Wing. The playwright alleged that the accused deceived him and made videos, later blackmailing him for money. The suspects were arrested and the case is currently proceeding at the Lahore High Court.
