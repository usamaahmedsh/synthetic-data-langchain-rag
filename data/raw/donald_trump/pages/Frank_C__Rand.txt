== Early life and family background ==
Frank C. Rand was born on February 25, 1876, in Red Banks, Mississippi. His father was Henry Oscar Rand and his mother, Ada Elizabeth Norfleet. One of his paternal great-grandfathers, John Rand (1786–1865), was a planter in Colbert County, Alabama, in the Antebellum South. Another paternal great-grandfather, Moses Carlock, was a large planter in Marshall County, Mississippi. His paternal grandfather, Jesse P. Norfleet, was a cabinetmaker from Suffolk, Virginia, who lived at the historic Dunvegan cottage in Holly Springs, Mississippi, until 1861.
Rand had two brothers, Jesse H. and Edgar Eugene, and two sisters, Eva Cornelia and Helen Octavia. He grew up on a cotton plantation in Red Banks. At the age of nine, he moved to Holly Springs, Mississippi, where his father was the co-founder of Rand, Johnson & Company.
Rand was educated in public schools in Holly Springs. He attended the Webb School, a preparatory boarding school in Bell Buckle, Tennessee, from 1890 to 1894. Its founder and namesake, William R. Webb, was one of his teachers. Rand enrolled at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1894, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1898. At Vanderbilt University, he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

Rand began his career as a stock clerk for the Roberts, Johnson, and Rand Shoe Company in 1898. He became its vice-president in 1907. When the company became known as the International Shoe Company in 1911, he remained as vice-president. He then served as its president from 1916 to 1930, and as its chairman from 1930 to 1949. In 1928, as president, Rand reported strong, steady growth. The company, which became the world's largest manufacturer of shoes, eventually changed its name to Furniture Brands International.
