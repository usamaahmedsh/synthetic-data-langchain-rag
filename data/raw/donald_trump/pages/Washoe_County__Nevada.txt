== History ==
Trappers and explorers, along with several emigrant trails to California and Oregon went through Washoe County in the 1840s. In January 1844, Lieutenant John C. Frémont discovered and named Pyramid Lake, with the expedition going down to the Truckee River soon after. Later that year, the Stephens-Donner route opened, the route crossing the Humboldt Sink to the Truckee River and went over the Truckee Pass.
Mormons created the State of Deseret in 1849, a provisional state, that included much of Nevada and Washoe County. During the California Constitutional Convention, there was debate on whether to include the Great Basin in the state. One attorney argued "a great portion of it [the Great Basin] can be of no advantage to us.  A vast deal of it is an immense unexplored region -- a barren waste." An attorney from San Francisco, Myron Norton, stated "Whatever the region may be, a barren waste or a land of promise, we
have no right to relinquish it. It may be rich in agricultural and mineral wealth, we know nothing to the contrary. No man knows whether it is worthless or not." Ultimately, the majority felt they would gain nothing by extending the border beyond the Sierra Nevada.
Migration to California attracted settlers to the Truckee Meadows, and just south of the Truckee River, the Junction House was established in 1850.
On September 9, 1850, Congress created Utah Territory, which included Nevada and Washoe County.
Washoe County was created on November 25, 1861, as one of the original nine counties of the Nevada Territory. It is named after the Washoe people who originally inhabited the area. It was consolidated with Roop County in 1864. Washoe City was the first county seat in 1861 and was replaced by Reno in 1871.
In 1911, a small band of Shoshone and Bannock led by Mike Daggett killed four stockmen in Washoe County. A posse was formed, and on February 26, 1911, at the Battle of Kelley Creek, eight of Daggett's band were killed, along with one member of the posse, Ed Hogle. Three children and a woman who survived the battle were captured. The remains of some of the members of the band were repatriated from the Smithsonian Institution to the Fort Hall Idaho Shoshone-Bannock Tribe in 1994.
In 1918, Washoe County elected the first woman elected to the Nevada Legislature, Sadie Hurst, a Republican.
As of 2013, "Washoe County is the first school district in the state to offer Paiute classes," offering an elective course in the Paiute language at Spanish Springs High School and North Valleys High School.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 6,542 square miles (16,940 km2), of which 6,302 square miles (16,320 km2) is land and 240 square miles (620 km2) (3.7%) is water.

There are two incorporated cities within the county, namely Reno and Sparks. In 2010, there was a ballot question asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should become one combined governmental body. According to unofficial results the day after the election, 54% of voters approved of the ballot measure to consolidate the governments.
The Truckee Meadows of Washoe County starts at the furthest southern runway of Reno Tahoe International Airport, GPS Coordinates 39.468836,-119.770912 and runs south east. Rattle Snake Mountain at Huffaker Park, follows the span of Steamboat Creek to the southern east end of Washoe County. This is the last of the range/prairie and wild grass water shed from the eastern range of the Reno Tahoe basin.
Washoe County is a wildfire prone area. These risks are particularly in Southern Reno (or areas just outside the city limits). As many structures are now being built in forested areas, along with often having favorable fire weather, most residents are under severe fire danger. Many fires in Southwest Reno have been destructive or spread quickly, such as the Caughlin Fire in 2011.

== Politics ==

Washoe County was rather conservative for an urban county  for much of the late twentieth century. It voted for the Republican candidate all but once between 1944 and 2004 (in the 1964 Democratic landslide). However, starting in the 1990s, it became more competitive, going from a 22-point win for George H. W. Bush in 1988 to only a three-point win for Bush in 1992. From 1996 to 2004, the Republican candidate tallied a margin greater than four points only once, in 2000. The county swung hard to Barack Obama in 2008, going from a four-point margin for George W. Bush in 2004 to a 12-point margin for Obama in 2008. Since then, it has always voted Democratic in presidential elections, albeit by relatively narrow margins consistently under 5%. In 2016 and 2024, Donald Trump lost the county even as he won the presidency, the first time in 124 years that a Republican won the White House without winning Washoe County.
While Washoe is now more of a swing county federally, it remains very Republican down ballot. Republicans still hold the majority of the county's seats in the state legislature. Democratic strength is concentrated in Reno and Sparks, while the rest of the county remains powerfully Republican.
The county is governed by an elected five-member Board of County Commissioners and an appointed county manager. The commissioners serve staggered four-year terms - three are elected during midterm elections and two during presidential elections.
