The county was created in 1862 and organized in 1879. It was named for Charles Eli Mix, an official of the Bureau of Indian Affairs influential in signing a peace treaty with the local Lakota Indian tribes. The easternmost approximately 60% of the county comprises the Yankton Indian Reservation.
The Papineau Trading Post, whose building is now in Geddes, South Dakota, was an early county seat.  Geddes tried to wrest the county seat from Wheeler in 1900, 1904, and 1908. The Charles Mix County Courthouse in Lake Andes was built in 1918.


== Geography ==
Charles Mix County lies on the south line of South Dakota. Its south boundary line abuts the north boundary line of the state of Nebraska (across the Missouri River, which flows southeastward along the county's south line). A smaller drainage flows south-southwesterly to the river along the east county line, separating it from Bon Homme County. The county terrain consists of rolling hills, mostly dedicated to agriculture. The terrain drops off into the river basin along the county's southwest side, but otherwise generally slopes to the southeast.
The county has a total area of 1,150 square miles (3,000 km2), of which 1,097 square miles (2,840 km2) is land and 53 square miles (140 km2) (4.6%) is water.
