Deez Nuts was a satirical presidential candidate portrayed by Brady C. Olson who ran for president of the United States in 2016. 
On July 26, 2015, Olson—then 15 years of age, and a resident of Wallingford, Iowa—filed a statement of Deez Nuts's presidential candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. In polls conducted by Public Policy Polling in Iowa, Minnesota, and North Carolina in mid-August 2015, Deez Nuts polled at eight, eight, and nine percent, respectively, garnering media attention. 
On August 19, 2015, The Daily Beast revealed that Deez Nuts was actually Olson. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Olson said that he jokingly created the Deez Nuts candidacy "half-trying to break the two-party system" and half out of frustration with the leading candidates, choosing the pseudonym based on the bofa meme. Olson endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination and Ohio Governor John Kasich for the Republican nomination. Olson has expressed libertarian views. According to Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution, Olson did not meet the minimum age requirement (35 years) to serve as president if elected.
Nuts' bid for the presidency drew attention to other questionable candidates who had filed to run for office. Analyst Jim Williams of Public Policy Polling opined that because of a fringe element of the population with a penchant for anti-establishment candidates, "you could call [the third party candidate] anything, and they would get their 7% or 8%".
A poll taken in Texas in mid-August 2016 showed Nuts receiving 3% support for the presidency; this figure exceeded the amount of support received by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and the deceased gorilla Harambe, another Internet phenomenon. On October 11, 2015, Deez Nuts announced on Facebook that he intended to run for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Nuts cited the scarcity of candidates for the position as well as his alleged eligibility for it.

Music producer Diplo said "If I got to decide between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ... I'm definitely voting for Deez Nuts."

In August 2016, the Federal Election Commission announced its intent to punish future satirical candidates for president for filing false documents with a federal agency.
Olson later enrolled at the University of Iowa to study finance. In 2019, he told The Gazette, "I don't foresee ever running again".
