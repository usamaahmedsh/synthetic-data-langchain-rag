Hubbard is a city in Marion County, Oregon, United States. The population was 3,426 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area.


== History ==
Hubbard was named for Charles Hubbard, who was an Oregon settler in 1847. The railroad arrived in 1870 and a station was situated in the town.
The city made the news when then-former President of the United States Donald Trump, as a write-in candidate, won a seat on the board of the Hubbard Rural Fire Protection District in 2023 via a dice-roll tiebreaker over four other write-ins. However, since he didn't live in or own property in the district, he was excluded from the board.
