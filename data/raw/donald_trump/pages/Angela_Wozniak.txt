=== 2014 election ===
In the 2014 election, Wozniak ran for the 143rd State Assembly seat previously vacated by Dennis Gabryszak. She ran on both the Republican and Conservative ballot lines. The seat was considered to be a Democratic stronghold. In an upset, she defeated Democrat Mark M. Mazurek. Wozniak ran on an anti-corruption platform.


=== Tenure ===
One of Wozniak's first legislative actions was to introduce the Public Officers Accountability Act, which would have disqualified felons from receiving government contracts, lobbying or holding public office. She spoke out against unfunded mandates and proposed a moratorium on such mandates. Wozniak opposed letting transgender students use the school bathroom of their choice.


=== Scandal ===
On March 9, 2016, Wozniak was disciplined and banned from hiring interns following an investigation by the Assembly Ethics Committee. The investigation related to allegations made by a staffer with whom Wozniak had engaged in an extramarital affair. While the Committee "found insufficient evidence to conclude that the relationship at any point constituted 'quid pro quo sexual harassment'", it did find that Wozniak had retaliated against the staffer by tarnishing his reputation after their affair ended. Wozniak later apologized for exercising "very poor judgment [by] having [a] relationship with a staffer."
In May 2016, Wozniak announced that she would not seek reelection to her Assembly seat. She was succeeded by Democrat Monica P. Wallace.
As part of a 2019 settlement with New York's Joint Commission on Public Ethics, Wozniak admitted that she had broken state law when she made personnel decisions regarding the staffer with whom she had engaged in an affair.
