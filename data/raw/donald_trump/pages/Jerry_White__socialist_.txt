White authored a book, published in 1990, entitled Death on the Picket Line: The Story of John McCoy. The book, an investigative report, is about the killing of a militant coal miner, McCoy, as well as the history of the United Mine Workers (UMW) in West Virginia.

In 1996, White ran as the first presidential candidate for the newly-formed Socialist Equality Party (SEP) with vice presidential candidate Fred Mazelis.
In 2006, White ran for Michigan's 12th Congressional district seat as an SEP candidate.
In 2008, White ran as the SEP presidential candidate with vice-presidential candidate Bill Van Auken.
