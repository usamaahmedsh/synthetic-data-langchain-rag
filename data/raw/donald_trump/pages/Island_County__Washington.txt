Island County is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, its population was 86,857. Its county seat is Coupeville, while its largest city is Oak Harbor.
The county's name reflects the fact that it is composed entirely of islands. It contains two large islands, Whidbey and Camano, and seven smaller islands (Baby, Ben Ure, Deception, Kalamut, Minor, Smith, and Strawberry). Island County was created out of Thurston County on December 22, 1852, by the legislature of Oregon Territory, and is the eighth-oldest county in Washington. It originally encompassed what are now Snohomish, Skagit, Whatcom, and San Juan Counties.
Island County comprises the Oak Harbor, Washington Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Seattle–Tacoma, WA Combined Statistical Area.

== Government and politics ==
The county government is led by a board of commissioners with three elected members that represent geographical regions of Island County.
Island County is divided politically between its north and south. While the north (Oak Harbor) is conservative – Donald Trump received almost 55 percent of the 2016 vote and carried most precincts – most southern and central precincts voted for Hillary Clinton. The south-central area (Coupeville, Langley) voted over 50 percent for Clinton, just over 30 percent for Trump.
In 2024, despite the country and state of Washington shifting to the right, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris improved in the county and had one of the best performances in its history, winning 56.43% of the vote. Harris outperformed Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 landslide performance, and was only exceeded by Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1932 and 1936 performances.
