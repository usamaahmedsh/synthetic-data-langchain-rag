William Bacon Camp (November 25, 1913 – November 13, 1975) was Comptroller of the Currency from 1966 to 1973. He was born in Greenville, Texas.
Camp, a national bank examiner, was appointed Comptroller by President Lyndon Johnson. During his term, a rapidly growing economy led to a dramatic increase in the assets held by national banks.
The agency's remaining responsibility in the issue of currency - redeeming Federal Reserve notes - was transferred to the Treasurer of the United States. Camp is unique among Comptrollers: he was nominated by a president from one political party and renominated by a president, Richard Nixon, from another. He died on November 13, 1975, in Rockville, Maryland.
