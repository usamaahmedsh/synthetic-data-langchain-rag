Prior to the incorporation of Hunters Creek Village, German farmers settled the area and opened sawmills. By 1936, the community had a sawmill and several residences.
In the mid-1950s, effort to form a Spring Branch municipality failed. The city incorporated in 1954 with a mayor-alderman government.

By 1966, the community had a school and a church. Between 1960 and 1980, the population increased from 2,478 to 4,580. In 1982, the population fell to 4,215.
