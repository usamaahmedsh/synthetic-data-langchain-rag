In 2021, Romero, then serving as an attorney in the Albany County Public Defender's office, ran for and won the 6th ward seat in the Albany Common Council, whose incumbent, Richard Conti, had declined to seek re-election. Her platform included police reforms in favor of more transparency and accountability, including the release of police disciplinary records. She assumed office in January 2022. There, she worked on support for the homeless and mental health. She also helped legalize skateboarding in the city.
In early 2024, Neil Breslin, dean of the New York State Senate announced his retirement and was succeeded by then Assemblymember Patricia Fahy. Six Democrats competed for Fahy's 109th Assembly district seat and Romero won with the support of the Working Families Party. In response to rising living expenses, Romero's platform included free healthcare and better access to healthcare.
After winning the general election, Romero expressed concerns with deficits in the state budget, especially regarding the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and high living expenses, as well as investments in Albany. She supports zoning reform and new construction subsidies for the purposes of improving affordable housing. She also called for legislation to avoid deaths such as that of Robert Brooks at Marcy Correctional Facility.
