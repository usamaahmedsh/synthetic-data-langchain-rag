=== The Daily Caller and Tucker Carlson Tonight (2016–2022) ===
By February 2016, Pfeiffer had become a journalist for the right-wing news website The Daily Caller. In December 2017, he left the Caller to join Fox News as an associate producer of Tucker Carlson Tonight (2017–2023). In January 2019, Pfeiffer proposed to Joely Friedman, a communications consultant for National Geographic Partners; they married in December. By April 2022, he had worked as an investigative and editorial producer for Tucker Carlson Tonight. Text messages that Pfeiffer had sent to Tucker Carlson after the 2020 presidential election were released in Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network (2023). The messages revealed that Pfeiffer had sought to disregard "reckless demagogues" who engaged in efforts to overturn the election. Carlson and Pfeiffer rebuked claims that sufficient electoral fraud had occurred to ensure Joe Biden's victory, particularly from Sidney Powell, whom they had regarded as a "nut". Pfeiffer told Carlson that Trump's business career has had a "pretty low rate at success" and expressed fear of Trump's supporters after the January 6 Capitol attack.
