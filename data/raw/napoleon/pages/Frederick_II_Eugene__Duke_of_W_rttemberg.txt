Friedrich Eugen, Duke of Württemberg (21 January 1732 – 23 December 1797) was the fourth son of Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, and Princess Maria Augusta of Thurn and Taxis. He was born in Stuttgart. From 1795 until 1797, he was Duke of Württemberg.


== Early life ==
Frederick was born in Stuttgart on 21 January 1732, as the fourth son of Charles Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, and his wife, Princess Marie Auguste of Thurn and Taxis. As a younger son, he was not expected to succeed as Duke of Wurtemberg. Initially intended for the clergy, he instead joined the military and was appointed to several posts by King Frederick the Great of Prussia.


== Soldier ==
After serving with Frederick the Great during the Seven Years' War, he took up residence in 1769 at his family's exclave, the County of Montbéliard, of which he was also made lieutenant-general in March 1786 by his eldest brother, Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg, who had begun to come into the inheritance of portions of the County of Limpurg in the 1780s. He bought the castle and lordship of Hochberg in 1779, but re-sold it in 1791 to his brother. The next year he was named governor of the margraviate of Ansbach-Bayreuth by King Frederick William II of Prussia, to whom it had been sold by the last prince of that branch of the House of Hohenzollern. Montbéliard was taken over by the short-lived Rauracian Republic in 1792, then annexed by the French Republic in 1793.


== Duke ==
His elder brothers had only daughters, so following Charles Eugene's death in 1793 and then that of their brother Duke Ludwig Eugen (1731–1795), Frederick Eugene became reigning duke until his own death two years later. He acquiesced to the Treaty of Paris (7 August 1796) with revolutionary France, in which his claims to Montbéliard and all other territories on the left bank of the Rhine River were renounced. Frederick Eugene retained, however, France's recognition of the integrity of the Duchy of Württemberg itself.


== Marriage and children ==
Frederick Eugene married Friederike Sophia Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt, a niece of Frederick the Great. Despite his Catholic faith, their marriage contract stipulated that the children would be raised by their mother in the reformed faith. They had twelve children:

Charles Henry (3 July 1772 – 28 July 1838), married under the name "Count von Sontheim" in 1798 Christianne-Caroline Alexeï (1779–1853), who was created Baroness von Hochberg und Rottenburg in 1807 and was raised, along with her children, to the rank and title of Countess von Urach on 12 November 1825. Of their five daughters three died young, while Countess Marie von Urach (1802–1882) married Karl, Prince of Hohenlohe-Kirchberg (1780-1861) in 1821 and Countess Alexandrine von Urach (1803–1884) married Charles, Count Arpeau de Gallatin (1802–1877) in 1825, from whom she was divorced in 1843.
The duke died at Hohenheim on 23 December 1797, aged 65.
