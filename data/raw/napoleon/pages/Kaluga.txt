Kaluga (Russian: Калу́га, IPA: [kɐˈɫuɡə] ) is a city and the administrative center of Kaluga Oblast, Russia. It stands on the Oka River 150 kilometers (93 mi) southwest of Moscow. Its population was 337,058 at the 2021 census.
Kaluga's most famous resident, the space travel pioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, worked there as a school teacher from 1892 to 1935. The Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics in Kaluga is dedicated to his theoretical achievements and to their practical implementations for modern space research, hence the motto on the city's coat of arms: Колыбель Космонавтики, Kolybélʹ kosmonávtiki ("The Cradle of Space-Exploration").


== History ==
Kaluga, founded in the mid-14th century as a border fortress on the southwestern borders of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, first appears in the historical record in chronicles in the 14th century as Koluga; the name comes from Old Russian kaluga  is "bog, quagmire". During the period of Tartar raids it was the western end of the Oka bank defense line. The Great stand on the Ugra River was fought just to the west. In the Middle Ages Kaluga was a minor settlement owned by the Princes Vorotynsky. The ancestral home of these princes lies southwest of the modern city.
On 19 January 1777, the Kaluga drama theatre opened its first theatrical season, established with the direct participation of the Governor-General Mikhail Krechetnikov.
Kaluga is connected to Moscow by a railway line and by the ancient roadway, the Kaluga Road (now partly within Moscow (as the Old Kaluga Highway), partly the A101 road). This road offered Napoleon his favored escape route from the Moscow trap in the fall of 1812. But General Kutuzov repelled Napoleon's advances in this direction and forced the retreating French army onto the Old Smolensk Road, previously devastated by the French during their invasion of Russia.
On several occasions during the Russian Empire Kaluga was the residence of political exiles and prisoners such as the last Crimean khan Şahin Giray (1786), the Kyrgyz sultan Arigazi-Abdul-Aziz (1828), the Georgian princess Thecla (1834–1835), and the Avar leader Imam Shamil (1859–1868).
The German army briefly occupied Kaluga during the climactic Battle of Moscow, as part of Operation Barbarossa. The city was under full or partial German occupation from October 12 to December 30, 1941. In 1944, the Soviet Government used its local military buildings to intern hundreds of Polish prisoners of war — soldiers of the Polish underground Home Army — whom the advancing Soviet front had arrested in the area around Vilnius.
Discovery of a Stone Idol
In 1953, on the outskirts of Kaluga, in the area of an old logging site near the Lesnichevka ravine, the local press reported the discovery of a small stone idol approximately 18 cm tall. The figurine is made of light-colored stone, has a simplified phallic shape, and features a large eye carved on the upper part of the figure. Based on fragmentary local-history commentaries from the mid-20th century, the find was interpreted as a possible depiction of a local household cult character conventionally referred to as Nilo, whose association was presumed to be linked with participants of ritual or comedic performances within the Kaluga region.
The original photograph of the artifact has not been preserved; the image circulated today is a modern visual reconstruction created from written descriptions.
