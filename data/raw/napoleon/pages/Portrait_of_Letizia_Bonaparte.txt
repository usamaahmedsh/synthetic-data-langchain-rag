It depicts the Corsican noblewoman Letizia Bonaparte, best known as the mother of the emperor of France Napoleon. Several of her other children, part of the Bonaparte dynasty, acquired royal status during the Napoleonic era.

After the Bourbon Restoration of 1814 he switched to painting Louis XVIII and members of the House of Bourbon.
She is portrayed at full-length seated in a well-furnished apartment overlooking the Tuileries Palace in Paris, with a bust of Napoleon beside her. The painting was taken to Italy by the sitter's granddaughter Mathilde Bonaparte when she married, Today it is in the collection of the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh, having been acquired in 1988 with the support of the Art Fund.
