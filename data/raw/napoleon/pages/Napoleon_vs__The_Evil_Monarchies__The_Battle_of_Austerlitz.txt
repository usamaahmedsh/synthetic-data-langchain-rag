== Reception ==
M. Evan Brooks reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that "BOA is a Napoleonic simulation of introductory/medium complexity. Its mechanics are dated (and it shows) and it lacks a Napoleonic panache. Given the current state-of-the-art, BOA is not "art"! However, for the true Napoleonic buff, BOA may be of some entertainment value."
