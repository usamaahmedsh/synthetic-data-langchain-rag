Wagram (French pronunciation: [vaɡʁam]) is a station on Line 3 of the Paris Métro located in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. Alphabetically, the station is the last on the Paris Métro system.


== Location ==
The station is located under Avenue de Villiers, between Avenue de Wagram and Rue Jouffroy-d'Abbans. Oriented approximately along an east–west axis, it lies between Pereire and Malesherbes stations.


== History ==
Wagram was opened on 23 May 1910 when the line was extended from Villiers to Pereire. The station is named after the Avenue de Wagram, which was named after the Battle of Wagram, where Napoléon Bonaparte defeated the Archduke Charles of Austria in 1809 in the Austrian town of Deutsch-Wagram near Vienna.
From the 1960s, the platforms walls were modernized with the installation of a metallic bodywork with blue painted surrounds. This technique is then widely used in the network stopping points as an inexpensive way to modernize them quickly.
As part of the RATP's Renouveau du métro program, the station's corridors were renovated in the course of the 2000s.
In 2018, 2,565,333 travelers entered this station.

The name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates incorporated into the bodywork.
