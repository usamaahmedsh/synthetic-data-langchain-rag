Victor-Maurice, comte de Broglie (12 March 1647 – 4 August 1727) was a French Royal Army officer.
Victor-Maurice de Broglie was born in the  De Broglie house, a noble family originally from Piedmont. He was the  son of François-Marie, comte de Broglie and Angelique de Vassal, Countess of Favria. After the death of his father  he inherited the countships of Revello and de Broglie, the marquisate of Senonches and  also received the Government of La Bassee, near Lille.
He served under Condé, Turenne, and other commanders of the age of Louis XIV in the Franco-Dutch War and other conflicts. He was with Turenne during the Frond in the 1654 campaign to take Stenay.
He was named maréchal de camp in 1676, lieutenant-general in 1688, and finally marshal of France in 1724, just three years before his death.
He had three sons, one of whom predeceased him.  The second son, Charles-Guillaume, marquis de Broglie, was his heir, while the third son, François-Marie, a general and a marshal of France like his father, became the first Duke of Broglie.
