It depicts Napoleon, Emperor of France, inspecting a parade of the Imperial Guard in the Place du Carrousel outside the Tuileries Palace in Paris around 1808. He is approached by a wounded veteran holding out a petition. Amongst the officers accompanying the Emperor are Eugène de Beauharnais, Joachim Murat, Michel Ney, Jean-Andoche Junot and Géraud Duroc. The Horses of Saint Mark, looted from Venice but later returned in 1815, can be seen on the right.
