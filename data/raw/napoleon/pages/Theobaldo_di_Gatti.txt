Theobaldo di Gatti (c.1650-1727) was a composer and musician, born in Florence. He moved from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to France after hearing the music of Jean-Baptiste Lully. King Louis XIV made him a naturalised French subject in 1675. In France he was simply known by the name Théobalde.
He earned his living playing the bass viol, both as a teacher and as a member of the orchestra of the Académie Royale de Musique (the Paris Opera). He composed songs, duets and two works for the stage.
