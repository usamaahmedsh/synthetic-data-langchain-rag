=== Monza Le Mans Series 2008 crash ===
On 27 April 2008, during a Le Mans Series race at the Monza circuit, a mechanic issue caused his Courage car to slide and spin onto the grass. This in turn instigated a cartwheeling motion upon the vehicle, which resulted in most of the car's bodywork and all but one wheel being torn off before it came to rest on the opposite side of the track. It narrowly missed the tail of Allan McNish's Audi R10 which was in front. Ortelli sustained a broken ankle as a result.
