Pernety (French: [pɛʁnɛti] ) is a station on line Line 13 of the Paris Métro in the 14th arrondissement.
It is named after the nearby rue Pernety, named after Viscount Joseph Marie de Pernety (1766–1856), one of Napoleon's generals and owned the land where the street was built.


== History ==
The station opened on 21 January 1937 as part of the initial section of the old line 14 between Porte de Vanves and Bienvenüe (today known as Montparnasse–Bienvenue). On 9 November 1976, the old line 14 was incorporated into line 13 following the latter's extension in successive phases from Saint-Lazare.
As part of the "Un métro + beau" programme by the RATP, the station's corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised during the 2000s.

=== Station layout ===


=== Platforms ===

The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The lower portion of the side walls are vertical instead of elliptical due to the narrower width of the road it lies beneath.
On the platform towards Les Courtilles or Saint-Denis - Université, the former station manager's office has been turned into a small exhibition, Vitrine Ecolière, by students from EREA Croce Spinelli, a local vocational school. It serves as an opportunity to introduce students to merchandising through applied arts and sales, putting into use their training to develop various showcases in a simultated shop window. The showcase changes depending on the holidays throughout the year, such as Halloween, Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, amongst others.


=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by line 59 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by line N63 of the Noctilien bus network.
