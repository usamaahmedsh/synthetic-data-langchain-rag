Royal Affairs in Versailles (French title: Si Versailles m'était conté) is a 1954 French-Italian historical drama directed by Sacha Guitry. Described as "a historical film showing Versailles from its beginnings to the present day", it  tells some episodes through portrayal of the personalities who lived in the Palace of Versailles. Its sister films are Napoléon (1955) and If Paris Were Told to Us (1956).
The film is notable for the presence of a great number of well-known French actors, often appearing in short parts. One unknown actor playing a major character is Gilbert Bokanowski (credited as Gilbert Boka) portraying Louis XVI. Bokanowski was actually the film's production manager and was cast because of his strong resemblance to the monarch.
Its English translation title is If Versailles Were Told to Me. Despite French production, the film is best known by its English title Royal Affairs in Versailles.
