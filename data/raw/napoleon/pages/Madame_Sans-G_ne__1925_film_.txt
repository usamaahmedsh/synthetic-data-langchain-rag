== Plot ==

As described in a film magazine review, at the time after the French Revolution, a sharp-witted laundress fights for her country and wins favor with a Duke. After her marriage to him, she is accepted in the court of Napoleon. Because her manners are not fashionable, she is called before Napoleon. She triumphs over the court with her wits and returns to her husband, whom she loves.

== Production ==
The film was produced and filmed in France, as Swanson was on extended vacation there. She soon became involved with Henri de La Falaise, hired by Paramount to be her French interpreter, and who later became her third husband.


== Preservation ==
With no prints of Madame Sans-Gêne located in any film archives, it is a lost film.  A vintage movie trailer displaying short clips of the film still exists, however, and can be seen on YouTube.
