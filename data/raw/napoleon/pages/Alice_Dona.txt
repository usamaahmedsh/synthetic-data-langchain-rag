Alice Donadel (born 17 February 1946 in Maisons-Alfort), known by her stage name Alice Dona, is a French singer and songwriter. She was born to an Italian father from Veneto and a French mother, both musicians.
As a singer, she recorded 11 singles from 1963 to 1965, among them "Demain, j'ai dix-sept ans", "Surboum 63", "Mon Train de banlieue", and "Avec toi"; the latter, co-written with Jacques Demarny, was her entry for the Rose de France song competition in 1966. After starting a family she then turned more to songwriting and provided a series of hits for other French singers during the 1970s.
