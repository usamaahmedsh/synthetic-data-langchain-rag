He was elected to the Estates General of 1789. He assumed command of the Army of the Midi in February 1792 and successfully invaded Savoy in September. Nevertheless, he was accused of treason by the Revolutionary government and fled to Switzerland before he could be arrested. He was allowed to return to France in 1795 and he died there three years later.
