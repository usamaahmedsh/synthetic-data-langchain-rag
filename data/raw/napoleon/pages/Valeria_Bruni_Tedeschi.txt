Bruni Tedeschi was born in Turin, Italy, in the Piedmont region of Italy, the daughter of Marisa Borini and Alberto Bruni Tedeschi. Like her younger sister, Carla Bruni, she has settled in France. The girls were raised bilingually, as their family moved to Paris in 1973, fearing kidnappings and, later, the terrorism of the Red Brigades.
Bruni Tedeschi trained in drama at Jean Darel and the American Center with Blanche Salant before joining Patrice Chéreau’s École des Amandiers in Nanterre in the early 1980s. She made her television debut in 1983 in Paolina, la juste cause et la bonne raison, and the same year appeared on stage in Platonov, directed by Chéreau. Her first significant film role came in Hôtel de France (1987), also directed by Chéreau.
Over the following decades, Tedeschi became known for a body of work spanning over 85 films, television productions, and stage performances.

Her performances include roles in La Reine Margot (1994), Nénette et Boni (1996), Ceux qui m’aiment prendront le train (1998), and La parola amore esiste (1998).

Her later notable roles include 5×2 (2004), A Castle in Italy (Un château en Italie, 2013), which was nominated for the Palme d’Or at Cannes, and Les Estivants (2018).
