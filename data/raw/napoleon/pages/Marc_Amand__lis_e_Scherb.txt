He was charged with suppressing the revolt in the Vendée, in particular at the Battle of Savenay, on 13 July 1794.  The representatives on mission  of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle appointed him provisionally as brigadier general on 6 December 1794. He commanded the Second Brigade, in the division of Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, at Mainz on 4 January 1795.
