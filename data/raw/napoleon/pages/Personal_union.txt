A personal union is a combination of two or more monarchical states that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. A real union, by contrast, involves the constituent states being to some extent interlinked, such as by sharing some limited governmental institutions.  It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a federal state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.
The term was coined by German jurist Johann Stephan Pütter, introducing it into Elementa iuris publici germanici (Elements of German Public Law) of 1760.
Personal unions can arise for several reasons, such as:

inheritance through a dynastic union, e.g., Louis X of France inherited France from his father and Navarre from his mother
decolonization, where ex-colonies install the monarch of the former colonizing power as their own upon becoming independent, e.g., several former members of the British Empire (then becoming Commonwealth realms)
autonomization, e.g., instead of annexing Finland into the Russian Empire, Alexander I of Russia organized Finland as an autonomous grand duchy and acted as its head of state
They can also be codified (i.e., the constitutions of the states clearly express that they shall share the same person as head of state) or non-codified, in which case they can easily be broken (e.g., by the death of the monarch when the two states have different succession laws).
The concept of a personal union has only very rarely crossed over from monarchies into republics.
There are currently two personal unions in the world: the 15 Commonwealth realms, who share Charles III as their head of state, and one of the co-princes of Andorra being the President of France.

==== Congo Free State and Belgium ====

==== Near East ====
During the reign of Sargon II and Senaquerib, Babilonia and Assyria were two reigns connected via the same ruler.


==== Georgia ====
Kingdom of Iberia and Colchis were connected power of the monarch in the years 300–90  BCE (Pharnavazid dynasty).
Kingdom of Pontus and Colchis were connected power of the monarch in 109 BCE-64 CE.
1000–1010 Kingdom of Abkhazia and Iberia ruled by Bagrat III. In 1010 it united (together with the annexed Kakheti kingdom) into a single Kingdom of Georgia.
Kingdom of Kakheti and Hereti were connected power of the monarch in 1020s–1104.
Principality of Mingrelia and Principality of Abkhazia in the 1557–1660 years under the rule of the House of Dadiani.
Kingdom of Kartli and Kingdom of Kakheti united under the rule of a single monarch in 1513–1520 (David X), 1625–1633 (Teimuraz I), 1648–1658 (Rostom), 1660–1664 (Vakhtang V), 1723 (Constantine II/III), to finally unite the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti in 1762 under the reign of Heraclius II and his descendants.

==== Goryeo ====
Personal union with Shenyang in the Mongol Empire (1308–1313; 1345-1351)
As King of Goryeo (高麗國王) and Prince/King of Shenyang (瀋陽王) in 1308–1310
As King of Goryeo and Prince/King of Shen (瀋王) in 1310–1313, 1345-1351
King Chungseon of Goryeo reigned as King of Goryeo in 1298 and 1308–1313 and as King of Shenyang or King of Shen from 1307 (according to the History of Yuan) or 1308 (according to Goryeosa) to 1316. At that time, Goryeo had already become a vassal of the Mongol Empire and the Mongol imperial family following the Mongol invasions of Korea and the Goryeo royal family had established strong ties by intermarrying with the Mongol imperial family. Because King Chungseon was a very powerful man during the reign of Külüg Khan, Külüg Khan gave him a new title on top of his kingship of Goryeo, the Prince/King of Shenyang, in 1307 or 1308 specifically mentioned as thanks to his efforts of bringing the Khan to power. 
However, he lost his power in the Mongol imperial court after the death of the Külüg Khan. Because the Mongol Empire made Chungseon abdicate the crown of the Goryeo in 1313, the personal union was ended. King Chungsuk, Chungseon's eldest son, became the new King of Goryeo. In 1316, the Mongol Empire made Chungseon abdicate the crown of Shen in favour of Wang Ko, one of his nephews, resulting in him becoming the new King of Shen. 
Following Wang Ko's death, Chungmok of Goryeo and Chungjeong of Goryeo were also dual rulers of both Goryeo and Shenyang from 1345-1351.

==== Albania ====

==== Andorra ====
Due to Andorra's special government form resulting from the Paréage of 1278, it is a diarchy with co-princes. One of them is the Bishop of Urgell; the other was originally the Count of Foix. It is through this feudal co-prince system that the Principality has entered partial personal union with:

Kingdom of Navarre (1479–1620, then integrated into France).
Kingdom of France (1589–1792, 1814–1815, 1815–1830, 1830–1848).
In 1607, the feudal co-prince was Henry IV of France, who issued an edict that his position should be held by the French Head of State. While the new government did not take up the title during the French Revolution, all polities of France since 1806 regardless of their government form have accepted that their head of state is an ex officio co-prince. This led to personal unions with:

First and Second French Empires (1806–1814, 1815 and 1852–1870).
Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Republics of France (1848–1852, 1870–1940, 1944–1958, since 1958).

Note: The point at issue in the War of the Spanish Succession was the fear that the succession to the Spanish throne dictated by Spanish law, which would devolve on Louis, le Grand Dauphin — already heir to the throne of France — would create a personal union that would upset the European balance of power; France had the most powerful military in Europe at the time, and Spain the largest empire.

Historically, the Crown of the United Kingdom was considered to be indivisible. However, as the self-governing dominions of the British Commonwealth gained control over the exercise of the royal prerogative in the 1930s, this concept has evolved so that 'the Crown in right of' each realm and territory acts independently of the other realms and territories. The constitutional conventions established in the Statute of Westminster 1931 which required uniformity in the laws of succession, along with a common format for the royal styles and titles, distinguished the Crown of the Commonwealth realms from a personal union, under which there is no alignment between multiple thrones and different laws of succession may exist but subsequent developments have made the situation more ambiguous.

== Republics in personal union ==
Because heads of state and government of republics are ordinarily chosen from within the citizens of the state in question, sovereign republics very rarely share common leaders. A few examples are:

Uniquely, the President of France is ex officio a constitutional monarch (or, more accurately, diarch) in neighboring Andorra, with the title of Co-Prince. This status was inherited from the role of the French monarchs in Andorra.
From 1802 to 1804, the First Consul of the French Republic and the President of the Italian Republic was the same person: Napoleon Bonaparte. Bonaparte continued as President of Italy even after he was proclaimed Emperor of the French, until he was proclaimed King of Italy in 1805.
During the later stages of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, Simón Bolívar was simultaneously President of Gran Colombia (24 February 1819 - 4 May 1830), President of Peru (10 February 1824 – 28 January 1827), and President of Bolivia (12 August 1825 - 29 December 1825). Bolívar had, as President and military Commander-in-Chief of Colombia, led a Colombian army to secure Peruvian independence in 1824-25, and was given the office of President by the Patriot republican governments of both Peru and Bolivia (renamed in his honor from "Upper Peru") as an emergency measure to help secure independence from Spain. After the end of the war, Bolívar relinquished his Peruvian and Bolivian offices and returned to Colombia.
In 1860 Marthinus Wessel Pretorius was simultaneously elected as the president of Transvaal and Orange Free State. He tried to unify the two countries, but his efforts failed, leading to the Transvaal Civil War.
