Eugénie Laetitia Bonaparte (Eugénie Laetitia Barbe Caroline Lucienne Marie Jeanne Bonaparte; 6 September 1872 – 1 July 1949) was the youngest daughter of Napoléon Charles Bonaparte, 5th Prince of Canino and princess Maria Cristina Ruspoli.


== Early life ==
Eugénie was born in Grotta Ferrata, Italy. Her paternal grandparents were Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte, son of Lucien Bonaparte and nephew of Emperor Napoleon I, and Princess Zénaïde Bonaparte, daughter of Joseph I of Spain and niece of Emperor Napoleon; thus she is his double grandniece. 
She had two older sisters: Zénaïde Eugénie, who died aged two in 1862, ten years before Eugénie was born; and Marie Léonie, who was two years older, born 10 December 1870.


== Personal life ==
On 16 November 1898 in Rome she married Léon Napoléon Ney (1870–1928), 4th Prince de la Moskowa, son of Michel Aloys Ney, 3rd Duc d'Elchingen, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1903.
