== Personal life ==
According to his 1989 biographer, Dorothy Knowles, Gatti was born in 1924 in a shantytown in Monaco to Auguste Rainier an Italian anarchist from Piedmont, who escaped murder in a Chicago slaughterhouse because of his political activities and fled Benito Mussolini's regime and to Letizia Lusona a maid. 
He died on 6 April 2017.
Gatti, like his father, was an anarchist. His works included themes of prisons and escape.
