Mysophilia is a paraphilia where erotic pleasure is derived from filth. Mysophiles may find dirt, soiled underwear, feces, unwashed people, or vomit to be sexually arousing.
People with mysophilia have been known to be aroused by unclean locations, such as an alleyway or a dirty bathroom, and behaviors, such as not bathing for many days at a time.


== In culture ==
The protagonist of the novel Wetlands, and the film based on the book, would be considered a mysophiliac, deriving pleasure from not washing and from dirty locations, such as toilets.
Napoleon Bonaparte, while campaigning in 1796, wrote to his wife Joséphine: "Please don't wash, will arrive in three days". This can be interpreted as mysophiliac behaviour if it is assumed this was to ensure her clothes, as well as her person, were soiled.
