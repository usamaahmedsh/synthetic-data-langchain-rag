He returned to the French Navy for the American Revolutionary War at the rank of frigate lieutenant. He served on the fluyt Bricole from September to December 1778, the frigate Boudeuse until March 1779, and then joined the Guerrier, on which he was wounded during the Battle of Grenada. Between May and October 1780, Lhéritier served on Languedoc, and later on Séraphin and Pivert.
After the war, Lhéritier returned to the merchant Navy, sailing as an officer on a number of ships before earning his commission as captain on Adolphe in April 1792.

On 17 March 1793, Lhéritier was promoted to Lieutenant and joined the Navy on the Nymphe. Promoted to captain, he was appointed to Convention (ex-Sceptre, on which he had served as a seaman) on 28 October 1793. On 5 May 1794, he took command of the America, which he commanded at the Glorious First of June where his ship and himself were captured by the British.
Lhéritier was kept as a prisoner of war in England until he was exchanged in April 1795, and appointed to Pluton, before being promoted to Chef de Division on 21 March 1796 and transferring on Constitution .
On 14 March 1798, Lhéritier took command of Hercule and was tasked to cruise to Brest, departing from Lorient on the 20th. The next day, Hercule was intercepted by HMS Mars, which led to the Battle of the Raz de Sein. Lhéritier attempted to board Mars, and sustained himself a sabre blow to the head and had his leg injured. After a two-hour fight, Hercule was captured and Lhéritier taken prisoner again.
Exchanged again, Lhéritier was court-martialed for the loss of Hercule, and unanimously acquitted.
