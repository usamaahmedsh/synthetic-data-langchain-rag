He was the son of François Laurent, a clothier, and Françoise Bergery. He married Marie-Anne Mallet and his son, Louis François Alcindor Laurent (1802–1850) also embraced a military career. He joined the Régiment Royal on 10 May 1767. Part of the regiment participated in the Siege of Yorktown, 1781, although it is not clear if Laurent was with the battalions that served there; another battalion served in Martinique under command of François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé.

Laurent was a simple soldier at the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Based on meritorious actions, he was promoted to brigadier general in 1794 and served in several different armies in France's campaigns against the First and Second coalitions. He was at the Battle of Valmy. He also participated in the first and the second battles at Lines of Weissenburg in 1793, as well as battles at Battle of Saverne and Landau with the Army of the Moselle; he was wounded twice in the leg, once traveling between Sluis where he was headquartered, and Brussels.   He was responsible for defending the coast of Zeeland. He served continuously until the Treaty of Campo Formio, despite his leg injury, often on the front line. He was made a Commander of the Legion of Honor on the recommendation of Jean François Aimé Dejean June 1804. Subsequently he was employed in the department of Jemmapes.
