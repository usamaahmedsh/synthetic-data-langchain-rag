Graziella de Michele (born 28 December 1956) is a French singer-songwriter of Italian descent. She is famous for her 1987 single "Le Pull-over blanc" ("The White Sweater"), which was a top-three hit on the SNEP singles chart and achieved Silver status.
In the early 1980s, De Michele followed her musical idols, Ramones and Talking Heads, around Europe before ending up stranded in London. She returned to France and worked as a nurse until she achieved success with "Le Pull-over blanc."
The song was first covered by Arno Hintjens in 1990, then by Alexandre Balduzzi and Nolwenn Leroy of Star Academy on the Fait sa Boum album in 2003.
De Michele's next singles passed unnoticed and therefore the singer can be considered as a one-hit wonder.
