== Career ==
In 2017, Lomepal performed more than a hundred live shows and received over 100 million views on his YouTube channel.
On 8 December 2018, Lomepal released his second studio album Jeannine, titled after his grandmother who suffered from schizophrenia, from which he drew inspiration, exploring themes that use the illness as a power rather than a burden.
On 25 October 2019, Lomepal released the album Amina. The album is essentially a deluxe version of his album Jeannine including all of its songs, with some having been remixed, replaced with a live/acoustic version or somehow modified.
Lomepal's album Mauvais ordre was released in September 2022.
His stage name comes from the fact that his friends always thought he was sick because of his pale complexion, hence Lomepal (for "the pale man"). His first stage name was Jo Pump. He is friends with the Belgian rapper Roméo Elvis, with whom he collaborated on the song "1000°C" for Lomepal's album Jeannine.


== Sexual assault allegations ==
In July 2023, an Instagram post alleged that Lomepal was among several other performers well known in the industry for making repeated and unwanted sexual advances. Also in 2023, an investigation was opened into a complaint of rape filed against him in 2020 over an incident from 2017. The Cabaret Vert festival canceled the concert at which Lomepal was scheduled to perform on August 17, 2023 due to the complaint.
Mediapart revealed on May 21, 2024 that a third woman filed a complaint of rape against Lomepal also over an incident from 2017. 
The Paris prosecutor's office closed the preliminary investigation against Lomepal, ruling on January 24, 2025, it did not find sufficient evidence to support the allegations of rape made by three women.
The prosecutor's decision indicated the alleged incidents could not be "clearly established" during the investigations, marking a significant moment for Lomepal, who has consistently denied the accusations. He took to Instagram to state, "I am innocent. I resume my life."
