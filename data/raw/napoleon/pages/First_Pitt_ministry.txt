William Pitt the Younger led the government of the Kingdom of Great Britain from 1783 to 1801.
In 1800, the Acts of Union between Great Britain and Ireland were accepted by their respective parliaments, creating the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (UK), which would be governed by the former Parliament of Great Britain (now the UK Parliament). Pitt governed this new state for the first month of its existence, until differences with King George III over Catholic emancipation caused him to resign.
