The Duke of Reichstadt (German: Der Herzog von Reichstadt) is a 1931 French-German historical drama film directed by Viktor Tourjansky and starring Walter Edthofer, Lien Deyers and Grete Natzler. It is the German-language version of the French film The Eaglet, based on the play L'Aiglon by Edmond Rostand. It takes its name from the formal Austrian title of Napoleon II, its central character.
It was shot at the Joinville Studios in Paris and on location around Vienna. The film's sets were designed by the art director Serge Piménoff.
