== Career ==
Tonazzi began her career at age 14 playing for VGA Saint-Maur. Saint-Maur had been a dominating force in French women's football during the late 1980s winning six league titles in between the years 1983 and 1990. In 2001, Tonazzi joined FCF Juvisy, who had taken over Saint-Maur as the most dominant French club by winning four of the ten titles awarded during the 90s. However, Juvisy lost control of the league heading into the new millennium with Toulouse taking over as the force. In Tonazzi's debut season with Juvisy (2001–02), she scored 14 goals. Her emerging talent led to her making her international debut for France. The following five years at Juvisy saw Tonazzi become an established international. She scored 68 league goals during the span and also helped Juvisy win two league titles (2002–03 and 2005–06), as well as a Challenge de France title in 2005.
During the 2007–08 season, Tonazzi scored a league high 27 goals in just 22 matches. She scored a career-high five goals on the final match day of the season against Évreux. The following season saw a decrease in goals as Tonazzi only appeared in 12 matches, however she contributed 15 goals. Juvisy finished in 3rd position, one point shy of qualifying for the newly created UEFA Women's Champions League.
