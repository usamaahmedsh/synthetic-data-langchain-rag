The Order of Saint George of the Reunion is an order of knighthood of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. It was established to replace the Royal Order of the Two-Sicilies. 
It was created on 1 January 1819 by Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies to reward military valor and merit. It received its name to celebrate the reunification of Naples and Sicily into one kingdom after the Congress of Vienna. 
The dynastic dispute within the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies means the position of Grand Master is disputed between Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria and Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro. The head of the Spanish branch, Prince Pedro, considers this Order to be dormant and it is no longer awarded.
