Without a particular desire to become a musician, he joined a gospel choir at 17 and discovered the harmonica by listening to Bob Dylan and Neil Young. The harmonica is an anti-hero, with a bit of an outsider side to music. It’s not something you learn at the conservatory! And it has this playful aspect, like a toy. It suited me perfectly, kind of like my alter ego, since I wasn’t a star student!After his baccalauréat, he studied at the Saint Louis Jazz School in Rome and then returned to Paris to take courses at the CIM jazz school and the Atla School.

In 2006, he released a blues EP, Mainly Blue, in English, which he self-produced.

English allows me to be sincere, to reach the depth of my thoughts. In French, I tend to search for words, refinement, and that doesn’t necessarily create the most beautiful images. For now, I don’t feel capable of writing in French; I have the temptation to sweeten my feelingsHe participated in various festivals, including the Memphis International Blues Challenge, where he was a finalist, and then began an international tour (United States, Canada, Russia, Hungary, Benelux, Italy, Spain...)

a music open to jazz, blues, soul, folk, and Afro-American influences
For RTL:

a little gem, unformatted, not coming directly from the factories. The tracks are airy, and you encounter all styles (even some pop-rock sounds). His slightly raspy voice moves wonderfully with the notesHe was nominated for the 2014 Victoires du Jazz award in the Revelation of the Year category.
