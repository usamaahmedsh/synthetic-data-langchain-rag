Members of this family bore the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, granted to them in 1759 by Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor.


== History ==
Broglia (pronounced [ˈbrɔʎʎa]) was the name of an old Piedmontese noble family, from which were descended the counts of Casalborgone, Mombello and Revello, and the lords of Arignano, Cortandone, Fontanetto Po, Chieri, Cocconato, Monale, Montaldo, Pont Canavese and Santena. 
The first reference to the name is dated 1245, mentioning one Ardizzone Broglia, father of Guglielmo, decurione of Chieri.
The founder of the French de Broglie line was Francesco Maria, count of Revello, of the Broglia di Chieri family. Born in 1611 in Piedmont, he took service in the French army in the  Thirty Years' War and was naturalized in France after 1643. He is now known as François-Marie, comte de Broglie. After distinguishing himself as a soldier, he died, a lieutenant-general, at the siege of Valenza on 2 July 1656.
His son, Victor-Maurice, comte de Broglie  (1647–1727), served under Condé, Turenne and other great commanders of the age of Louis XIV. He became maréchal de camp in 1676, lieutenant-general in 1688, and finally marshal of France in 1724.
His grandson, François-Marie, was made duc de Broglie and a peer of France in 1742. His great-grandson, Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie, was created Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1759 by Emperor Francis I.
All junior members of the House of Broglie bear the title of prince de Broglie, while the head of the family is the duc de Broglie. A junior line used the title of prince de Broglie-Revel, after one of its lordships.
Louis, 7th duc de Broglie (1892–1987), a physicist and Nobel laureate, was one of the founders of quantum theory.
