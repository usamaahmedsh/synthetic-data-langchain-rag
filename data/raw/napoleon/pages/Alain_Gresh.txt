== Biography ==
Alain Gresh was raised in Cairo, Egypt. His biological father was Henri Curiel, a Jewish-Egyptian communist activist who was forced to leave for France in 1950. Gresh knew Curiel as a family friend and only learned in his late twenties that he was his son. At the age of 14, Gresh moved to Paris to study mathematics and Arabic.  As soon as he arrived in France, he joined the French Communist Party youth.
After graduating from high school, he became the leader of the French communist youth. In 1978, he became secretary general of the World Festival of Youth and Students in Havana.
He was later named in charge of the French Communist Party foreign policy department.  He continued studying the Near East in college, and wrote his PhD dissertation on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).    In 2007,  he admitted he had regular meeting with leaders of the Soviet Union.  Gresh claims he created the first pro-Palestinian Organization in France after Moscow decided to change its foreign policy.
He was editor of Le Monde diplomatique, and retired at end of 2015. He then cofounded the website Orient XXI.
