Alfred Pizella (March 29, 1897 – August 9, 1937) was an Italian-born French singer and film actor. A star of the music halls he was often billed simply as Pizella leading to some confusion with the journalist and occasional actor Stéphane Pizella. He died in August 1937 in a car accident returning from Deauville.
