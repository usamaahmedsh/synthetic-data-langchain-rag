Loudon Park Cemetery is a historic cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland. It was incorporated on January 27, 1853, on 100 acres (40 ha) of the site of the "Loudon" estate, previously owned by James Carey, a local merchant and politician. The entrance to the cemetery is located at 3620 Wilkens Avenue.
The cemetery and Loudon Park Funeral Home, Inc. are locally owned and operated. Both the cemetery and the funeral home became privately owned in 2014 when they were acquired from Service Corporation International (SCI). Loudon Park Funeral Home was built on the grounds of the historic cemetery by Stewart Enterprises in 1995. SCI acquired Stewart Enterprises in 2013.


== Loudon National Cemetery ==
A portion of the eastern section is owned by the federal government as Loudon Park National Cemetery, acquired in 1861, and holds the remains of 2,300 Union soldiers killed during the Civil War. There is also a Confederate section where about 650 Confederate soldiers are buried, marked by a statue of a Confederate soldier. Since 2003, nearly all of the Confederates in this section have had new markers put on their graves under an "Adopt-a-Confederate" program. The entrance to the National Cemetery portion of Loudon Park is located along Frederick Avenue in the neighborhood of Irvington.
The Confederate Memorial was designed by Frederick Volck in 1870, paid for by Loudon Park Confederate Memorial Association and inaugurated on June 17, 1873. The statue originally features a Confederate soldier (sometimes mistakenly thought to be Stonewall Jackson) standing above a pair of young children; but the children were removed from the statue sometime between 1924 and 1980.
