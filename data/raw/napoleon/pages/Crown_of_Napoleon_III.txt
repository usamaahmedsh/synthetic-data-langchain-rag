The Crown of Napoleon III (French: Couronne de Napoléon III) was a crown that was made for Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Although he did not have a coronation ceremony, a crown was made for him on the occasion of the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris. The gold crown had eagle-shaped arches and others in the form of palmettes, set with diamonds, and topped by a monde.
During the same period, a consort crown was made for his empress consort, Eugénie de Montijo, which is known as the Crown of Empress Eugénie. After Napoleon III was overthrown in 1870, following the Franco-Prussian War, he and his wife lived in exile at Chislehurst in England, where he died in 1873.
The Crown of Napoleon III was dismantled in 1887 by the government of the French Third Republic.
