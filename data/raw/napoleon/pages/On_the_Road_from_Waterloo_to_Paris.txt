On the Road from Waterloo to Paris is an 1863 history painting by the British artist Marcus Stone. It depicts a scene from 1815 during the Hundred Days campaign. The French Emperor Napoleon, defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, has left his army and is taking shelter at a house on the road back to Paris. Dejected, he kneels to warm himself by the fireside. Napoleon abdicated shortly afterwards bringing an end to the Napoleonic Wars.
Stone was noted for his scenes, often with vague historical settings. This painting is of an  imagined scene  but is based on a specific historical context. The work was displayed at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1863. The painting is now in the collection of the Guildhall Art Gallery in London, having been bequeathed in 1902 by the art collector Charles Gassiot.
