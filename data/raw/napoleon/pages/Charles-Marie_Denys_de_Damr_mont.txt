Governor Damrémont had in his new mission to gather reinforcements and adequate resources in order to succeed in the conquest of the Constantinois region. The major opponents to French control In Algeria were Ahmed Bey (1786-1851) in the Constantinois, with the Emir Abdelkader (1808–1883) in Orania. Of these the War Ministry prioritised Ahmed Bey as to restore French honour following the defeat of Clauzel.


=== Setting conditions for the siege of Constantine ===


==== Mitidja ====

General Damrémont spent the first half of 1837 in partial engagements with rebels affiliated with Emir Mustapha (1814–1863) in the Algerian Sahel and Mitidja.
Indeed, the Emir Mustapha organized from his stronghold of Médéa in the Titteri massif, guerrilla attacks against the French camps in Mitidja and harassed the villagers who came to collaborate with the colonial authorities.
This conflicting situation at the gates of the Casbah of Algiers caused worry and hassle in Damrémont which could not quickly organize decisive expeditions and military campaigns outside the Mitidja.
But the Khachna and Djurdjura mountains were formidable barriers to the passage of his army and the terrain enabled the Kabyle tribes and the marabouts of the zawiyas belonging to the Rahmaniyya Sufi brotherhood to resist a future attack on Constantine.
On 8 May 1837, the attack on Reghaïa in Mitidja occurred, against a colonial farm of 3000 hectares in area by the Kabyles of Beni Aïcha, Issers and Amraoua. General Damrémont responded to the disarray which settled in Algiers among the French, the day after the raid on Reghaïa, to organize a punitive expedition to pacify the eastern region of Mitidja which borders the Kabylia of rebels subservient to the Emir Mustapha and the marabouts.


==== Kabylia ====

Governor Damrémont decided in the aftermath of the Mitidja troubles to task General Alexandre Charles Perrégaux with a mission to subdue the coastal town of Dellys from where the Amraoua Kabyles had used as a base to devastate the French agricultural concession in the Mitidja.
Instructions were given to General Perrégaux to divide the troupes coloniales involved in this punitive expedition against the Kabyles into two distinct military columns.
The first maritime column was to be commanded by Perregaux himself, and was going to embark on 17 May 1837 on ships from the port of Algiers in order to land on the shore of Oued Isser then move forward to disembark in the port of Dellys.
The second column of infantry and cavalry, which was to be commanded by Colonel Maximilien Joseph Schauenburg (1784-1838), would also begin a sustained march on 17 May 1837 from Boudouaou to reach the Col des Beni Aïcha to meet the naval forces disembarked from Perrégaux in the Issers valley in order to continue the expedition to the Amraoua dens around the Casbah of Dellys.


==== Peace with Abdelkader ====

Damrémont  took advantage of the presence of General Bugeaud (1784–1849) in Algeria to send him to Orania to attack the capital of the Emirate of Abdelkader in order to open up the region of Algérois with the strategic goal of bringing about stability in western Algeria so that  Damrémont  could devote himself to preparing the ultimate expedition against Constantine. Bugeaud was successful and would win a victory against the Emir at the Sikkak river, in turn leading to the Treaty of Tafna. Damrémont allowed by the peace with Emir Abdelkader's state  to concentrate greater force to the east to his objective


=== Constantinois ===

In October 1837 Damrémont commanded an expedition against Constantine. During the siege Damrémont was hit in the head by a bullet and mortally wounded during the evening of 12 October. He was replaced by general Valée who continued the attack and proceeded to capture the city on the 13th.
