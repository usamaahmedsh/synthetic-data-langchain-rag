== Branding ==

The Vietnamese Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the National Committee for APEC 2017 through the Agency for Fine Arts, Photography and Exhibition organized a logo design contest for the APEC Vietnam 2017 summit. The contest ran from March to April 4, 2016 and was open to both amateur and professional Vietnamese artists. The organizers of the logo design contests required the entries to feature the phrase "APEC Vietnam 2017", highlight Vietnamese culture, as well as to represent the five components of the 2017 summit which are dynamism, creativity, action, unity, and movement to the future. 234 submissions from 92 candidates residing in 20 provinces and cities across Vietnam for the competition were received by the ministry.
The winning logo design was announced in January 2017. The selected design was conceptualized by a group working for Mark&B Vietnam, a branding agency. The winning logo depicts stylised images of paddles and Lạc birds, a common motif on drums of the ancient Đông Sơn culture. The placement of the elements suggest a circular movement which is meant to represent a "dynamic APEC".
