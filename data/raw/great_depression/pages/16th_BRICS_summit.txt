== Participating leaders ==


=== In person ===

Indian prime minister Modi and South African president Ramaphosa chose to attend the BRICs summit instead of the 2024 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which was held the same week in Samoa. The Independent observed that this is a sign the two Commonwealth of Nations states "place greater weight on maintaining relations with China and Russia than on the more diffuse attractions of CHOGM".


=== Online ===
Two days before the start of the summit, Brazilian president Lula da Silva announced that he would not be attending in person due to a minor brain hemorrhage following a fall. However, he announced he would participate via videoconferencing. Foreign minister Mauro Vieira led the Brazilian delegation in place of da Silva. 


== Host invited guests ==

Miguel Díaz-Canel, First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, was invited to the summit but stayed in Cuba due to the 2024 Cuba blackout. Aleksandar Vučić, president of Serbia, could not attend due to a conflicting visit from European Union representatives to Serbia. Both Cuba and Serbia sent representatives to the summit in place of their respective heads of state.

== Controversy ==

The summit sparked significant controversy, particularly surrounding UN Secretary-General António Guterres’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Critics, including political scientist Alexander J. Motyl in his article published on The Hill, argue that Guterres’s cordial interaction with Putin, whom the International Criminal Court has charged with war crimes, undermines the moral authority of the United Nations. Motyl and others contend that Guterres’s actions implicitly endorse Putin's aggression in Ukraine, weakening both the UN’s credibility and its position on global justice. Ukrainian journalist Ihor Petrenko echoes this sentiment, condemning Guterres for failing to challenge Putin’s dismissive rhetoric regarding the war. In contrast, scholars like Bahauddin Foizee defend Guterres's engagement with controversial leaders as necessary for maintaining diplomatic channels and fostering peace. Foizee suggests that excluding Russia from international discussions could hinder the UN's broader peace efforts. Meanwhile, Lithuanian leaders, including Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė and Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, criticized Guterres for perceived moral inconsistency, noting his attendance at the BRICS summit with Putin and Belarusian President Lukashenko despite not attending a Ukraine-focused peace summit in Switzerland earlier. This, they argued, damages Guterres credibility as an impartial mediator. This debate highlights the complex balance between moral leadership and pragmatic diplomacy in a divided global landscape.
