The Future Readiness Indicator is an indicator developed by the IMD Center for Future Readiness. It assesses large publicly listed companies on their preparedness for future trends using historical data to compare innovation, resilience, and growth. Companies receive a composite score and are ranked within their respective industries. It was developed by Howard Yu in 2021 and covers 182 companies across six different industries.


== History ==
The Future Readiness Indicator was developed in 2021 by Howard Yu, with some rankings backdated to 2010 for analytical purposes only.


== Methodology ==
The ranking derives from seven primary, equally-weighted factors: financial indicators, projected growth, business diversification, workforce diversity/ESG, R&D, innovation outcomes, and liquidity/debt status, totaling 33 distinct variables.
The data is publicly accessible from company outlets, news sources, and thematic reports. Factiva, CrunchBase, Espacenet, Sustainalytics, and Google Trends also supplement data collection.
The indicator is calculated by collecting each company's historical data, performing computations for each variable, standardizing criteria data, aggregating variables into main factors, and assigning an overall ranking. Each company is ranked from 1 (best) to n (worst, n=sample size) on a 1-100 scale.
