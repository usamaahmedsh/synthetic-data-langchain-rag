== History and development ==

CF40 was created on 12 April 2008 as a club of 40 finance experts under 40 years of age, thus its name. It was founded and developed by Wang Haiming, previously a journalist and chief editor at 21st Century Business Herald. Chen Yuan was its founding chairman. 
CF40 is based in Beijing. It has also created the Shanghai Finance Institute (SFI) in Shanghai and the Northern Finance Institute (NFI) in Tianjin, in 2011 and 2016 respectively. Both these institutes have had Wang Haiming as their Executive President from their creation.
CF40 organizes events and conferences, alone or in partnership with other think tanks that have included Bruegel the Euro 50 Group, and the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE).
CF40 publishes studies and a periodical journal, China Finance Review. Its yearly Jingshan Report is a reference publication on China's financial system.
