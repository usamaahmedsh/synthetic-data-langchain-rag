== Operations ==
PagSeguro is an e-commerce company that intermediates payment between sellers and buyers by offering a billing option via email for traders who do not have a site or a well-structured e-commerce and it has agreements with several banking institutions so that sellers can offer buyers different payment methods. These banking institutions receive the payment and transfer it to the seller after making sure that there was no fraud in the operation. The service offers over 25 payment methods.
For purchases in which the customer neither receives the product, nor does it as agreed, a dispute (claim) can be started. PagSeguro mediates the dispute, in order to help the buyer to receive either the product or the money back, as well as to help the seller to have the transaction value refunded or to return it to the buyer.
In May 2016, PagSeguro launched the Split Payment, a tool that acts on transactions commissioning models. The tool was released in VTEX Day, the largest multi-channel retail event in Latin America, in which PagSeguro was also the master sponsor.
