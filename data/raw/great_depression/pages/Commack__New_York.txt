Commack ( KOH-mak) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the towns of Huntington and Smithtown in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York. The CDP's population was 36,124 at the 2010 census.


== History ==
The name "Commack" comes from the Secatogue Native American tribe who lived on the South Shore of Long Island between Copiague and Bayport. The Secatogue named their northern lands in the center of the island Winnecomac which means "pleasant lands." The name may have been inspired because of the area's flat lands with rich soil, and thick oak forests abounding with plants and wildlife. From its earliest days, Commack, originally spelled "Comac" had fertile soil which made it the perfect land for farming.
Commack is a suburban area, and, like most unincorporated places on Long Island, does not have a walkable downtown or "Main Street".

On November 14, 2006, radio station WBLI rated the Commack Motor Inn second of the seven wonders of Long Island, just behind the Flanders Duck and ahead of the Montauk Lighthouse. The Commack Inn gained notoriety by its advertisements on late-night television and radio, extolling "the perfect romantic getaway", its  "plush beds", "mirror ball disco room" and "heart-shaped love tubs". By the 1980s, the Commack Motor Inn had become such an accepted part of Long Island life that its gift certificates were prizes at social clubs. In a 1994 interview, actress Rosie O'Donnell recounted, "That's where everyone in high school went to have their first sexual experience."
