Asset Recovery Interagency Network - Asia Pacific (ARIN-AP) is an informal network of experts and practitioners in the field of asset tracing, freezing and confiscation which intends to serve as a cooperative group in all aspects of tackling the proceeds of crime in the Asia-Pacific region.
ARIN-AP was officially launched at the inaugural meeting held in Seoul between 19–20 November 2013. The meeting brought together 28 law enforcement or prosecutorial agencies from 21 jurisdictions in Asia-Pacific and 6 international organizations.

ARIN-AP is made up of national contact points designated by member countries in Asia and the Pacific and those contact points are inter-connected through the Secretariat. The Secretariat is located in the South Korean Supreme Prosecutors' Office.
