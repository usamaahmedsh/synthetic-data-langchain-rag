EuroBancshares, Inc. (commonly known as Eurobank) was a financial holding company founded on December 4, 1979 under the name of Española de Finanzas Trust Company in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On April 30, 2010, the bank failed and its deposits and assets were seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Its deposits and assets were subsequently sold to Oriental Bank and Trust.
EuroBank used to offer financial and insurance services in Puerto Rico through its wholly owned subsidiaries Eurobank Puerto Rico and EuroSeguros, respectively. Since its founding, it grew into a billion dollar financial institution, eventually operating through a network of 21 branches in 2005. Its headquarters were located at 270 Muñoz Rivera Avenue, near the Golden Mile District or "Milla de Oro" of Hato Rey, San Juan.


== History ==
Over the years, the name of the institution changed on various occasions. In 1988, after 9 years of operating under the name Española de Finanzas Trust Company, its name was changed to First Community Trust Company. In 1990, following the change in business strategy to lending activities focused on lines of credit to businesses and business loans to individuals of high net worth, the company changed its name to Eurobank & Trust Company. The company changed its name to EuroBancshares shortly thereafter. In view of the rapidly expanding residential home mortgage market in Puerto Rico, Eurobank established a Mortgage Division in late quarter 1999. However, after the 2008 financial crisis, the company suffered adversely, and on April 30, 2010, its deposits and assets were seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
