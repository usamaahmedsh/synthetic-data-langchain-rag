Chippewa Lake (formerly Chippewa-on-the-Lake) is a village in Medina County, Ohio, United States. It is located on Chippewa Lake, a natural inland lake in Ohio. The village was incorporated in 1920.  The population was 654 at the 2020 census.


== History ==
Chippewa Lake took its name from the Ojibwe tribe of Native Americans.
In the 1880s, Oscar Townsend and the Cleveland, Lorain, & Wheeling Railroad developed a vacation resort, eventually called Chippewa Lake Park, on the banks of Chippewa Lake. The Great Depression and extinction of interurban rail service crippled the park, but in 1937, Parker Beach purchased the resort. In 1978, after more than 100 years of operation, Chippewa Lake Park was shut down.
In 2008, scenes for the horror film Closed For the Season (released in 2010) were shot at the abandoned amusement park, using many of its decrepit attractions as backgrounds.
A large estate that was originally part of Townsend's empire in town remains intact today, and has operated for decades as The Oaks Lodge restaurant. The restaurant is a popular event space; its lakeside gazebo is often used for weddings.
