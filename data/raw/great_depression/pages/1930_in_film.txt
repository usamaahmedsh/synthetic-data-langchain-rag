The following is an overview of 1930 in film, including significant events, a list of films released and notable births and deaths.


== Top-grossing films (U.S.) ==
The top ten 1930 released films by box office gross in North America are as follows:


== Events ==
February 21: Anna Christie, Greta Garbo's first sound film is released, it grosses $1.5 million.
February 23: Silent screen legend Mabel Normand dies at the age of 37 in Monrovia, California after a lengthy battle with tuberculosis.
March 10: Release of Goodbye Argentina (Adiós Argentina), the first Argentine film with a (musical) soundtrack. Ada Cornaro has her first starring role and Libertad Lamarque makes her film debut.
April 6: William Fox sells his interest in Fox Film for $18 million and Harley L. Clarke becomes president.
May 27: Howard Hughes' epic film Hell's Angels premieres at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and features Jean Harlow in her first major role as well as some impressive aerial sequences. Although not a financial success upon its release due to its bloated budget, the film is acclaimed by critics and launches Harlow as one of the 1930s' biggest stars.
August 9: Cartoon character Betty Boop appears for the first time on screen, in the animated film Dizzy Dishes.
September 3: The Hollywood Reporter is first published.
September 19: The Love Parade receives a record six Academy Award nominations.
November 1: The Big Trail featuring a young John Wayne in his first starring role is released in both 35mm and a very early form of 70mm film. It is the first large scale big-budget film of the sound era, costing over $2 million. The film is praised for its aesthetic quality and realism that will not become commonplace until many decades later. However, due to the new film format and the film's release during the Great Depression, the film will go on to become a financial failure at the box office.
