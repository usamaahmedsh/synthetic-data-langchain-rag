== History ==
The site of Kingwood was once a forest owned partly by John Miller and Hugh Morgan. The Northwestern Turnpike leading from Winchester to Morgantown passed through the area. Kingwood was settled sporadically in the 1790s and 1800s until it was formally established by the Virginia General Assembly on January 23, 1811. It was named for a grove of tall, stately trees. The town was made the county seat of the new Preston County in 1818, and chartered in 1853.
The James Clark McGrew House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993; the Kingwood Historic District was added in 1994.

The annual Preston County Buckwheat Festival takes place in Kingwood over the last weekend of September. Farmers in the county grew buckwheat during the Great Depression to stimulate agricultural economic growth, with the festival starting in 1938 as an end-of-harvest celebration. The festival resembles a county fair, with livestock exhibitions and carnival rides. The festival also features three days of parades. Thousands of the namesake buckwheat pancake meals are prepared for the event.
Kingwood is home to Hovatter's Wildlife Zoo, also known as the West Virginia Zoo.
