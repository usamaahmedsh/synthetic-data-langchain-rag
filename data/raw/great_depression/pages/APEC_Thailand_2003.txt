== Theme ==
The theme of APEC in 2003 is "Different worlds: Partnership for the Future", which aims to bring together the greatest potential of all APEC economies to meet future challenges, in particular the free and open trade of APEC and investment in the developed APEC economies. This central theme is magnified by a series of five sub-themes designed to guide APEC working groups and forums in achieving their objectives.

The summit's logo was an image of “Sri Suphanahongsa” Royal Barge, a vessel used by the Thai monarch which symbolizes Thailand’s national heritage and culture and the strong bonds of historic, economic, social and cultural relations of APEC member economies. The revolving globe behind the royal barge signifies APEC's values, namely dynamism, interconnection, global economic cooperation and regionalism.
