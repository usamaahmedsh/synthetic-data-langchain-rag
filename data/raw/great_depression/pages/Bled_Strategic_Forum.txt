The Bled Strategic Forum is a global ideas platform founded in August 2006 by the government of the Republic of Slovenia on initiative of Dimitrij Rupel, then Slovenian Minister of Foreign Affairs. Ever since it is held in Bled Congress Centre next to Lake Bled.
It produces events, discussions, roundtables, projects, analyses and publications.


== Bled Strategic Forum International Conference ==
The annual Bled Strategic Forum International Conference, hosted in Bled, Slovenia, is a gathering of participants from various fields to exchange views and ideas. It is an intragovernmental project of the Republic of Slovenia that focuses on areas that align with Slovenian foreign policy priorities. 
The event traditionally takes place at the end of the summer (usually just before the UN General Assembly in September), each year under a different title that guides the content of the sessions. 


=== History ===
The Bled Strategic Forum was launched in 2006, at a time when Slovenia was embarking on its path of European and Euro-Atlantic integration after joining the EU and NATO in 2004. The event was created on the basis of the successful Slovenian Chairmanship of the OSCE. The venue – Bled – was chosen for its picturesque Alpine setting and prominence. 

In 2011, the Young Bled Strategic Forum was added. Since then, the Young BSF has grown from a one-day side event into a standalone three-day international conference for young participants. From 2012 to 2019, the programme also featured Business BSF, which has later been integrated into its main part. Over the years, the event has hosted some 60 heads of state and government, 380 ministers and 150 representatives of international organisations, as well as over 250 think-tank representatives and 1500 media representatives.

In 2024, the Bled Strategic Forum co-organised a debate at the Munich Security Conference. The Bled Strategic Forum team attended the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi. In the same year, it also partnered with the Center for China and Globalization for a roundtable on Climate Change and Global Resilience in Beijing.
The Bled Strategic Forum's close partners also include Interpeace, the BMW Foundation, the Global Diplomacy Lab, etc.


== Secretaries general ==
The secretary general of the Bled Strategic Forum is responsible for steering the development and preparing events throughout the year. 


== Young Bled Strategic Forum ==
The first Young BSF took place in 2011 under the title 'The Power of the Future'. It was established with the aim of bringing together students and prospective young professionals from the diplomatic, academic and think-thank fields in both Europe and the Mediterranean region.
Since then, the Young BSF has developed from a one-day side event with a couple of the discussions happening on the margins of the Bled Strategic Forum into a three-day separate international conference for young participants from all over the world. Young BSF is now a separate event, yet connected with the Bled Strategic Forum.
