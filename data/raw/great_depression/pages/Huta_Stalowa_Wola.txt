== History ==
It was established in 1938 in the Second Polish Republic. It was a part of a series of investments made by the Polish government from 1936–1939 to create the Central Industrial Region. This was to be a group of factories built in the middle of the country, away from the borders with Germany and the USSR. It was designed to provide a reasonably secure location for the production of armaments and high technology goods.
The mill manufactured high alloy steels and weapons –  artillery and heavy machine guns –  in 1937. A city grew around the mill, and took its name from the town of Stalowa Wola.
In the 1960s and 1970s the company started production of heavy construction machinery, and in the 1980s, it was one of the major centers of resistance to the government (see 1988 Polish strikes). In 1991 Huta Stalowa Wola became a joint stock company.
It is the town's major employer.
On 1 February 2012, HSW SA sold its civilian construction machinery division to Guangxi Liugong Machinery.
In 2012, HSW bought Jelcz-Komponenty Sp. z OO.
In 2014, the Ministry of State Treasury decided to include HSW in the recently established Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa, headquartered in Radom, making it Poland's largest arms manufacturer.
In 2016, the expansion of the gun barrel manufacturing facility was completed to meet the needs of the AHS Krab self-propelled howitzer program, enabling the production of barrels up to 155 mm in caliber and up to 11 meters in length. As a result, HSW joined the select group of manufacturers in Western Europe with such capabilities.
In 2021, the Military Engineering Works in Dęblin merged with HSW.
In 2022, HSW acquired the Sanok-based bus and coach manufacturer Autosan.
In 2023, HSW purchased the civilian construction machinery part that it had sold to Guangxi Liugong Machinery including two production halls along with its employees. It was announced that this part of the company would switch to manufacturing military equipment.
