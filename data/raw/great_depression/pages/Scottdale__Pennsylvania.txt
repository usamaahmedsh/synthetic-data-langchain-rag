Scottdale is a borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States, 32 miles (51 km) southeast of Pittsburgh.
Early in the 20th century, Scottdale was the center of the Frick coke interests. It had steel and iron pipe mills, brass and silver works, a casket factory, a large milk-pasteurizing plant, and machine shops; all of the aforementioned are presently defunct. Scottdale is notable for its economic decline from a formerly prosperous coke-town into an archetypal Rust Belt town. Duraloy Technologies, "a supplier of specialty high alloy, centrifugal and static cast components and assemblies" is the last remnant of Scottdale's steel related prosperity.
In 1900, 4,261 people lived in Scottdale; in 1910, the population increased to 5,456; and in 1940, 6,493 people lived in Scottdale. The population was 4,384 at the 2010 census. Scottdale is located in the Southmoreland School District.


== History ==


=== 1770s-1900: Early history ===

It is difficult to identify when the first non-Native settler arrived in what is now the Borough of Scottdale, although the area witnessed an influx of Scotch-Irish immigrants in the late 1770s. In the mid-19th century, part of the present-day townsite was the location of a distillery, flour mill and post office known as Fountain Mills.
The Pennsylvania Railroad and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad each built branch lines through the community in the early 1870s. With the coming of the railroads, the community’s economy shifted from agriculture to manufacturing and mining. Two brothers who were local farmers, Peter and Jacob Loucks, realized the impact the railroads could have on the area and laid out a small townsite consisting of 24 lots, which went on sale in 1872.
The borough was originally named Fountain Mills, a reference to several mills that were operated in the borough. Scottdale was incorporated as a borough on February 5, 1874 and at that time named in honor of Thomas A. Scott, who had been president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and served as Assistant Secretary of War during the Civil War. Because Scottdale sits atop major coal deposits, the community flourished due to the surrounding coal mines, as well as ovens for converting coal into coke (fuel). The H. C. Frick Coke Company, controlled by Henry Clay Frick, was headquartered here. Scottdale’s factories in the early 20th century also produced iron pipe, tin, knives, steam engines, and caskets. 
Scottdale has two sites on the National Register of Historic Places:  Scottdale Armory (1929) at 501 North Broadway Street,  and the Scottdale Historic District, which encompasses the oldest parts of the borough.
The oldest extant building in the borough is the Jacob Loucks House at 115 Walnut Avenue, built in 1853. Otherwise, the borough’s oldest residences are concentrated on Loucks Avenue, where many houses date from the 1880s. As well, three downtown retail buildings can be dated to approximately 1880: 101 Pittsburgh Street, 143 Pittsburgh Street, and 4-10 South Broadway Street.
The West Overton Museum in Scottdale is the only pre-Civil War village still intact today in Pennsylvania. It was named to the National Register of Historic Districts in 1985 as an outstanding example of a 19th-century rural industrial village complete with farm, two floors of the Overholt Mill/Distillery, industrial tools, Blacksmith Shop, a wash house and a smokehouse.  It is a stop on the American Whiskey Trail
Pittsburgh street and North Broadway street both encompass the Scottdale Historic District, which is registered with the National Register of Historic Places since 1996. The buildings located in the historic district were constructed between 1853 and 1950. The buildings on Pittsburgh Street primarily housed businesses while North Broadway primarily had residences, though, since the early 2000's, a number of businesses were added to the street.


=== 1900-1968: Economic prosperity ===

Scottdale was home to 30,000 coke ovens in the early 1900s. These coke ovens were operated by hundreds of mining companies, this was due to Scottdale's location on the Pennsylvania Railroad which allowed these companies to ship coal and coke to major cities across the United States. Many of these mines were affected greatly by the Great Depression in 1929, leading to several of their closures.
The Coal and Coke Bike Trail in Scottdale was opened on the former route used by the Pennsylvania Railroad to ship coal and coke from Scottdale to Mount Pleasant. It encompasses five and a half miles of abandoned railroad and is maintained by volunteers from the Coal and Coke Chapter of the Regional Trail Corporation.
After the events of the Great Depression, new industrial work began to arise. One in particular, Duraloy Technologies, was opened sometime in the 1920s. Duraloy became the first company in the United States to create heat resistant alloys used for creating metal products. The company remains opened in its original building as of July 2024.
In 1900, The Geyer Performing Arts Center opened on Pittsburgh Street. It was originally an opera house and hosted vaudeville performances. In 1912, the building was sold and renamed The Scottdale Theater and was converted into a movie theater. The building changed hands once again in 1926 and renamed The Strand. The Strand was one of the first theaters to be equipped with a system that allowed for films with sound to be introduced. The Strand closed in 1969. With its reopening in April 1987, the theater shifted to stage theater performances, which it still holds as of June 2024. The Geyer has also been home to stand up comedy acts as well as concert performances.


=== 1969-present: Proposed mall construction and fallout ===

In 1969, Scottdale attempted an urban renewal project by building a mall. The mall was set to be located on Pittsburgh and North Broadway Streets in downtown Scottdale with a two pump gas station next-door. The development was to be equipped with several chain stores such as Giant Eagle and a Thorofare store. To prepare the site, new sidewalks, wiring and sewer lines were completed by June 1970.
By December 1970, the area was still not developed, with much of the businesses on the left side of Pittsburgh street being torn down to make room for the shopping plaza. Lanes of travel to access the area were left unpaved and only one lone bid had been accepted on space in the plaza, that being for the gas station that was to open next-door. Funding for the project began to run out with Scottdale's borough council refusing to give funding until buyers for lots began to show interest. The budget for a parking lot would be approved of in December 1971.
The mall continued to develop into September 1972 with one more bid being placed on space within the proposed plaza. Progress was finally made on the plaza in October 1974 when the borough signed a contract with a Uniontown based company to begin building on the site. By 1975, the mall project ceased, bringing the six year ordeal to an end.

On Saturday, May 1, 1976, the area of the former would-be mall was dedicated as a park. In the park, a gazebo was erected as well as three flagpoles. A walkway was also introduced to access the park from Pittsburgh Street. In the decades since the failed mall project, Scottdale has opened a Rite-Aid Pharmacy, a YMCA Pool, public library and Veteran Memorial in place of the former development.
Scottdale has also used the space annually for their Fall Festival. Since 1973, the Scottdale Fall Festival has hosted multiple outdoor vendors, music performances and an annual parade which is participated in by local businesses as well as high school groups such as the Southmoreland football team and marching band. The Fall Festival is also where Southmoreland High School's homecoming king and queen are crowned.

In the years following the failed mall construction, Scottdale has seen an economic decline. Approximately 2,000 of its residents are employed as of 2022 with a majority being in health care or retail work. 14.3% of Scottdale residents are below the poverty line with a median household income of just over $53,000. The borough also has an unemployment rate of 7.4%, which is 1.4% higher than the national average.
From 2004 until 2009, Scottdale's mayor was Patricia Walker. She was the borough's first female mayor as well as their first African American mayor. She was a 1951 graduate of Scottdale High School and had served on the borough council since 1988.
In 2022, the former Greystone Manor, once used as a department store, was purchased. Built in 1905, the building sat abandoned for decades where it deteriorated. With the purchase, $2 million in renovations have been made to restore the building.
Chuck King, Scottdale's mayor, was elected in 2010 and was named Pennsylvania's Mayor of the Year in 2024. King sought re-election, however, he lost the Republican nomination to Lindy House in the 2025 primary. With no democrats or third-party candidates on the mayoral ticket, she is projected to take the title of mayor of the borough in 2026.


== Education ==

In 1805, the first schoolhouse in the area was built adjacent from Gaut’s Dairy Farm in rural Scottdale, near Alverton. The first school board for the district was established on September 19, 1834. The district began to expand and several more buildings were added before being split into two districts; Scottdale School District and East Huntingdon School District.
The Scottdale school district opened as multiple schools throughout the borough including North, Central and South grade schools. The original high school building was constructed in the late 1800s on the site of present day Chestnut Street Park. The building was demolished in 1901 and replaced by a new school building directly across the street the same year. With the advent of the new school building, Scottdale's student body became known as the "Scotties" and began using the Scottish Terrier mascot with white and blue colors to represent the district. A football field was constructed behind the school building leading to the school instituting sports teams for the first time.
By the 1952 school year, Scottdale High School began to be outgrown by the student body as well as merging with nearby Upper Tyrone School District, leading to a new building being developed. The new site, located North Chestnut Street, for the renamed Scottdale Joint High School was purchased on June 22, 1953. The building was first used for a Scotties basketball game in January 1958 with the school officially opening for instruction on September 3, 1958.
In the fall of 1964, Scottdale and nearby East Huntingdon School District merged to form Southmoreland School District with students from Scottdale Joint High School now attending classes at Southmoreland High School in Alverton. The former Scottdale Joint High School building was renovated into Southmoreland Elementary and Middle School in 2010.
