Founded in Hong Kong in 1931, AIA has its markets in Southeast Asia and Australasia. It has wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates in 15 regions: Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Mainland China, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Macau, Brunei, and Cambodia.

On October 29, 2010, AIA Insurance and Investment Securities was spun off from the financially troubled American International Group (AIG) and successfully listed in Hong Kong. It issued 8.08 billion shares, raising HK$159 billion, while AIA Aurora (controlled by AIG) saw its stake diluted to 32.9%. Since listing on the Hong Kong main board, its market value has more than tripled, with total group assets reaching US$221 billion. AIA Insurance Holdings Limited (stock code: 1299) was, at one point, tied with Tencent as the largest constituent of the Hang Seng Index during the February 2021 review. However, following multiple index adjustments, its weighting gradually declined to 4.72% as of June 2025.
According to provisional statistics from the Insurance Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission for Hong Kong’s long-term insurance and investment securities business from January to December 2017, AIA has over 3 million customers. It is the insurance and investment securities company with the most policies in Hong Kong, meaning roughly one in every four Hong Kong residents with medical insurance or investment securities is an AIA Hong Kong customer. Additionally, combined membership of MDRT (Million Dollar Round Table) in AIA Hong Kong and AIA Macau ranked first for the 17th consecutive year.


== History ==

AIA traces its roots to 19 December 1918 when Cornelius Vander Starr founded what was then known as American Asiatic Underwriters in Shanghai, China (later American International Underwriters). Starr eventually expanded his business throughout the world. On 21 January 1939, Starr relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York City after the Japanese invasion of China and again on 5 April 1949 with the communist takeover of mainland China, and the Chinese AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG).
On 1 December 2009, AIG sold preferred equity interests in two newly formed international life insurance subsidiaries, American International Assurance Company, Limited (AIA) and American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to reduce its debt by US$25 billion.
AIA had planned to be a listed company in Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Securities and Futures Commission on 3 April 2010. However, on 2 March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), which at the time was the world's third largest IPO ever  (currently sixth as of June 2023).
On 11 September 2012, AIA acquired a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). AIA also entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network.
On 7 October 2012, AIA acquired ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion).
On 21 December 2012, AIG sold all of its 13.69% shareholding in AIA.
Since 2 June 2013, AIA has had an exclusive bancassurance agreement with Citibank that encompasses 11 AIA markets in Asia-Pacific, namely Hong Kong, mainland China, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Australia, and India.
