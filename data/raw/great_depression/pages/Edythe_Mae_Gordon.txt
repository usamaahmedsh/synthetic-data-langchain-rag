Edythe Mae Gordon (c. 1897 – 1980) was an African-American writer of short stories and poetry during the era of the Harlem Renaissance. Gordon primarily published her work in the Quill Club, a Boston-based publication founded by her husband Eugene Gordon and other figures of the Harlem Renaissance such as Helene Johnson and Dorothy West. The most well known example of her work was published after her death, Selected Works of Edythe Mae Gordon, as part of a project to support and reintroduce African-American women writers between 1910 and 1940, written by Henry Louis Gates Jr., Jennifer Burton, and Lorraine Elena Roses.


== Personal life ==
Edythe Mae Chapman was born in Washington, D.C., likely June 4 sometime in the period 1895–1900; the date is uncertain because the existing documents differ on her birth year. She was raised by members of her mother's family, surnamed Bicks; nothing is known of her father. She was educated at M Street School (later renamed Dunbar High), a public school, and graduated in 1916. M Street School employed literary figures Anna J. Cooper, Carter G. Woodson, and Jessie Redmon Faust during Gordon's education and may have influenced her writing. On January 10, 1916, she married Eugene Gordon, then a student at Howard University and later a writer for the Boston Post and eventual founder of the Saturday Night Quill Club and the publication, Saturday Evening Quill. By 1919 they had moved to Boston but had ten separate addresses across ten years of attending college and publishing; Eugene and Edythe separated in 1932 and divorced in 1942.
In 1926, Gordon enrolled as an undergraduate at Boston University. She graduated in 1934 with a B.S. degree in religious education and social services; a year later she earned her master's degree from the university's School of Social Services, a then-rare accomplishment for an African-American woman. Gordon's thesis for her master's focused on the status of Black women, and is published in her anthology Selected Works of Edythe Mae Gordon
After Edythe divorced Eugene, she effectively disappears from the literary world. The last public records of her life were a 1938 transcript to Boston University, a note with two poems published in Negro Voices in 1938, and her 1942 petition for divorce from Probate and Family Court. Her disappearance and its relation to her divorce are unknown. There is little information about Gordon after her 1942 divorce. She died in 1980.


== Writing ==
In 1925, Gordon's husband Eugene organized an African-American literary group, the Saturday Evening Quill Club, out of which grew a literary magazine, Saturday Evening Quill, of which he became the editor. Published three times a year, Quill contains most of the surviving specimens of Gordon's writing. Her first piece for Quill was a 1928 short story, "Subversion." It was listed among the year's distinguished stories by the O. Henry Award prize committee, which at the time rarely noticed works by non-white authors. Gordon would go on to publish two more short stories and a dozen poems in Quill. She also published two poems in the 1938 anthology Negro Voices, edited by Beatrice Murphy.
Gordon's fiction focuses on the unhappy lives of urban African-American couples, challenging some of the era's social norms. Her poems are lyrical odes to love that take their metaphors from nature.
A compilation of Gordon's work, Selected Works of Edythe Mae Gordon, was published in 1996. This compilation includes a total of seventeen works, three short stories and thirteen poems, with her Master's thesis, "The Status of the Negro Woman in the United States 1619-1865" in the center of the publication. That same year, "Subversion" and another story, "If Wishes Were Horses", were republished in the anthology Harlem's Glory: Black Women Writing, 1900-1950.


== Short stories ==

Mazie's death is foreshadowed by Mazie worryingly checking her bottle of sleeping medicine and remembering that an overdose would be fatal. Later in bed, Mazie thinks about how mistaken she was to leave her former husband, Jack, to pursue "Saxophone" Bill, as her husband had given her "everything- a house, expensively furnished, luxurious clothes, jewels." While he supplied her materially and was a devoted husband, he did not fulfill her on an emotional level. Despite her best friend Lettie's warning, Mazie feels certain she deserves to enjoy her life and be happy, propelling her to pursue Bill without care to her husband. Eventually, her and Bill runaway together but Bill's temperament is unfit for working and Mazie runs out of money eventually. When she is destitute, Bill disappears and Mazie picks up her current job as a hostess. While ruminating in bed, she determines to take her husband back. While she knows she's become older, she applies makeup and feels confident she can get her husband back.

== Thesis ==
Gordon wrote her Masters thesis for Social Work at Boston University about Black women in the United States, providing a detailed history and analysis of how Black women have been treated in the country. Titled "The Status of the Negro Woman in the United States 1619-1865," this thesis delves through the colonial times to the end of the Civil War, noting how laws have applied to the Black body and the ways Black women are oppressed both as women and as Black people. Gordon argues that the conditions of the African American woman was that of "semi-slavery" and exploitation.
