== History ==
The association was founded 1975 in Linz. It was originally based in Vienna, before moving to Tilburg (1982) and Geneva (1988). Since 2000, the secretariat has been located in Bonn, hosted by the German Development Institute, InWEnt and the Zentrum für Entwicklungsforschung. The Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung GmbH (INWENT), the German Development Institute and the Center for Development Research (ZEF) jointly took over the patronage at the new seat of the association.
