==== Invited Attendees ====
Leaders and representatives of Pacific Island nations were invited by Papua New Guinea to attend the "APEC Leaders' Dialogue with Pacific Island Leaders" on 17 November.


=== Absence of declaration and aftermath ===
According to Reuters, "the leaders failed to agree on a communique at a summit in Papua New Guinea on Sunday for the first time in their history as deep divisions between the United States and China over trade and investment stymied cooperation." Also according to same article: "O’Neill said that as APEC host, he would release a Chairman’s Statement, though it was not clear when." O'Neill said that the talks broke down over language about the World Trade Organization while Reuters reported that the cause for the impasse was disagreement on portions of the draft communique relating to the WTO which mentioned opposing "unfair trade practices" and reforming the WTO, while another concerned sustainable development.


== Security ==
Much of the security for the meeting was provided by the Australian Defence Force (ADF) at an estimated cost of AUD130 million. The Papua New Guinea Government passed special legislation which gave unprecedented powers to foreign forces and security personnel to protect visiting leaders.
