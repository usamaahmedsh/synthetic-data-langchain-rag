The Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, sometimes abbreviated to MAC, MAAC or MAATM, is a convention to facilitate the entering into bilateral tax information exchange agreements between state parties. The convention was developed by the OECD and the Council of Europe and was open for signature to members of both organizations on 25 January 1988, and entered into force in 1995.
An amending protocol was concluded on 27 May 2010, which since coming into force became open to any state at the invitation of present state parties.
