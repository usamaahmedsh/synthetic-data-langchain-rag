This is a list of representative leaders of BRICS states at each BRICS Summit since the group's inception in 2009.  

BRICS holds an annual summit, which each state or government leader attends. Each year the heads of government take turns assuming the presidency, whose job it is to set the agenda for, and host, the annual summit.
In 2023, Sergey Lavrov represented Russia instead of Vladimir Putin, and in 2024, Mauro Vieira represented Brazil instead of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
