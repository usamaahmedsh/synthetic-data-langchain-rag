ODI Global (formerly Overseas Development Institute) is a global affairs think tank, founded in 1960.


== History ==
In 1960 ODI began in small premises in Regent's Park of Central London. At the time, ODI operated a library devoted to international development issues and also performed consultancy work and contracts with the Department for International Development of the UK government. Since then, the organization has moved several times and is as of 2025 headquartered on Blackfriars Road.
In 2007 the ODI was named 'Think Tank of the Year' by Public Affairs News magazine. It was named 'Think-tank to Watch' in the Prospect 'Think-tank of the Year' awards in 2005 and is considered in international policy circles to be one of the world's leading think tanks on development.
It celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010, with guests including former ODI Fellow and UK Business Secretary, Vince Cable.


== Criticism ==
David Steven of Global Dashboard criticized the ODI in 2013 for not making the distinction between subsidy and having a lower VAT rate on fuel comparison to other goods.
