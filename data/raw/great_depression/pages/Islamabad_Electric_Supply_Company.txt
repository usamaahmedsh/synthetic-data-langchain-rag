Islamabad Electric Supply Company was founded as Rawalpindi Electric Power Company (REPCO) in 1923 during British India-era. In 1972, the company was nationalized and subsequently was taken over by the Government of Pakistan. It was publicly listed on Karachi Stock Exchange until 1985 when it was de-listed from the exchange.
IESCO was formed in 1998 to take over the assets, functions and responsibilities of the erstwhile Islamabad Area Electricity Board, which was then a division of WAPDA.
IESCO's core function is to supply, distribute and sell electricity in the area from Attock to Jhelum, and from the river Indus to River Neelum in Kashmir. It serves 2.8 million consumers directly, but touches the lives of more than 25 million people living in the 6 districts it services.
IESCO is structured into several administrative circles, each managed by different levels of engineering staff to ensure efficient operations and high customer satisfaction. The company operates with 108 Grid Stations with a total capacity of 5,224 MVA and distributes power through 951 Feeders, including distribution to AJK.
In terms of customer service, IESCO offers various online services including bill checking and downloading, complaint registration, and information about tariffs and maintenance schedules. They also have a dedicated helpline "118" and customer service centers spread across their service regions to address and resolve consumer issues promptly.
