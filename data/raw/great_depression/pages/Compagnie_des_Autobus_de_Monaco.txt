Compagnie des Autobus de Monaco (CAM) is the main public transport operator in Monaco. The company operates 6 regular bus lines, a night service, the Boat-Bus service and several school reinforcements.


== History ==
The Compagnie des Tramways de Monaco (CTM), created in 1897, operated several tramway lines during its existence. The trams circulated for the last time on January 26, 1931, before being replaced by buses. In 1939, the CAM succeeded the network of the former CTM.

In 2019 CAM started collaboration with Canadian company PBSC Solutions Urbaines to provide the Principality with a possibility to get around easily and in an environmentally friendly manner. There are 35 MonaBike stations as of 2020 and if the system works well, other stations will emerge.

CAM's goal by 2030, is to have 100% carbon-free, electric or hydrogen buses.
