== History ==

Sixty-five acres (26 ha) of land for the city of Marshall was donated by Jeremiah O’Dell, deeded on April 13, 1839. It was named for the United States Supreme Court Chief Justice, John Marshall, when chosen for the county seat. After the first two courthouses in Marshall were lost to fires, the Saline County Courthouse was constructed in January 1882; it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The courthouse is an enduring landmark in the center of the Marshall Square, and a legacy of Nineteenth-Century architecture.
The Nicholas-Beazley Airplane Company was an American aircraft manufacturer headquartered in Marshall in the 1920s and 1930s. At its peak, the company produced as many as one aircraft per day. In 1937, production of aircraft ceased, due to economic pressures from the Great Depression. Today, the Nicholas Beazley Aviation Museum is located at the Marshall Airport, with artifacts of interest from aviation history. ConAgra Foods owns the property of the old Nicholas-Beazley Airplane Company factory building, located right off the Marshall square; the factory building was torn down in the summer of 2015 to expand the ConAgra plant.
Marshall is rich in music history. Marshall is the home of Bob James, the acclaimed jazz musician; the Foothills Fest Music Festival; The Marshall Municipal Band; and, notably, the Marshall Philharmonic Orchestra. The Orchestra performs every year for the public, free of charge, and has been featured in the Los Angeles Times in 2006 and on NBC's American Almanac in December 1985, among other media outlets. The Philharmonic Orchestra has been performing for 52 years and counting. The Municipal Band has been performing for over 100 years and usually performs on the Courthouse lawn every Thursday evening during the summer months, filling the town square with music.
Marshall is also home to Jim the Wonder Dog. Jim earned his reputation as a 'wonder dog' during the 1930s, puzzling psychologists from both Washington University in St. Louis and University of Missouri. Dr. A. J. Durant, director of the School of Veterinary Medicine, tested Jim's abilities in a public demonstration. He concluded that Jim, "possessed an occult power that might never come again to a dog in many generations." Jim seemed to have the ability to guess the sex of an unborn baby and answer to orders in many different languages even though his owner, Sam Van Arsdale, spoke only English. Jim the Wonder Dog picked the winner of the Kentucky Derby seven years in a row, and also predicted the Yankees' victory in the 1936 World Series. A joint session of the Missouri Legislature was called in order to witness the talents of Jim. He died March 18, 1937.
During the Civil War, Marshall was frequently garrisoned by Union troops and was considered of some symbolic significance. This was due to Marshall’s close proximity to Arrow Rock (the hometown of the former Missouri governor in exile, Claiborne Fox Jackson). Before the Battle of Boonville, the former Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson ordered munition power to be removed from the Jefferson City to Boonville by boat. Where it was then hidden amongst the fields of counties of Cooper, Saline, etc. This powder was referred to as the Kelly Powder. In addition, after the events of July 19, 1859 (when three black men were lynched outside the county courthouse) had reached Northern media outlets. It prompted pro unionist to refer to Marshall, Missouri as “the place where men are burned at the stake.” Often labeling the residents as unruly. Numerous citizens were arrested on suspicion of feeding confederate bushwhackers, or for having sympathies to the "Southern Cause". Although Marshall was strategically unimportant, it was considered symbolic to the “Southern Cause”. Which ultimately led to the town being the victim of two Confederate raids, the burning of the County court house in August 1864, and the site of the October 13, 1863, Battle of Marshall, the climax of Colonel J. O. Shelby's 1863 "Great Raid". Confronted by a larger force of 1,800 Federal troops and Missouri State Militia, Shelby broke through, divided his command and withdrew from Missouri.
Missouri Valley College was founded in Marshall in 1889. The history of Missouri Valley College began during a conference at Sarcoxie, Missouri, on October 27, 1874, where the representatives of the several Presbyterian synods in the state of Missouri met to discuss founding the school. The school was affiliated with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church for a long period.
The college's original building, Baity Hall, was built in 1889, the year of the college's founding, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Victorian Era building is notable for its beautiful wooden staircase, vaulted wooden ceilings, and stained glass windows. Missouri Valley College is a private, four-year liberal arts college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). The 150-acre (60.7 ha) campus is found within the city limits of Marshall.

== Censorship debate ==

In October 2006, a resident of Marshall attempted to have the graphic novels Fun Home, by Alison Bechdel, and Blankets, by Craig Thompson, removed from the Marshall Public Library.  Supporters of the books' removal characterized them as "pornography" and expressed concern that they would be read by children. Marshall Public Library Director Amy Crump defended the books as having been well-reviewed in "reputable, professional book review journals," and characterized the removal attempt as a step towards "the slippery slope of censorship". On October 11, 2006, the Marshall Public Library Board of Trustees appointed a committee to create a materials selection policy, and removed Fun Home and Blankets from circulation until the new policy was approved. On March 14, 2007, the board voted to return both Fun Home and Blankets to the library's shelves.
