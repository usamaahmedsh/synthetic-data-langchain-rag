== Plot ==
In the midst of financial crisis, a recent college graduate Lance Zutterland, who leaves school in debt, decides to join with other college graduates – Ellis, Jack, Stewart, Chandler, and Allie – in stealing valuable paintings owned by Chicago's richest for themselves, under the supervision of Mel Donnelly. During the heist, the group express their anger by wrecking anything valuable, but Mel will only pay them if they deliver the stolen paintings intact. Lance bonds with Ellis's girlfriend Allie and they become friends but upon bringing Allie home to their apartment, Ellis intimidates Lance into staying away from her.
They buy expensive business attire and pretend to be accountants so they can interview upper class clients and trick them into giving them their addresses. In one of their heists, Chandler inadvertently crosses paths with a realtor and his facial composite is released to the public. When Ellis leaves the table for a minute, Jack plugs Ellis's phone into his laptop to copy the images, where they see the house of Daniel Wardlaw. The group realize that Wardlaw's house has a vault and they agree to rob his house. Mel summons the group and introduces his new henchmen, threatening to go after them if anyone reveals Mel's name. Later, they go to a nightclub where Allie loses consciousness after an overdose of cocaine. They bring Allie to the hospital, but knowing that bringing her in may lead to their arrest, Stewart kicks her out. Lance reluctantly helps her despite the group's objections and stays by her side for the night. On their way to Wardlaw's, Lance argues with Stewart over his recklessness. Arriving there, Jack ties Wardlaw up and Stewart and Chandler take most of the money from the vault. Angry over Stewart's negligence to Allie, Lance locks them up in the vault and drives away with Jack and the bags of money. They arrive at Ellis's apartment to get Allie, who refuses to go with Jack after being persuaded by Ellis. The rest of the group including Mel is subsequently arrested and are sentenced to at least seven years each.
Lance and Jack hide at a motel in Nebraska where they stay the night. The next morning, Lance wakes up to find Jack and the van gone. With nowhere else to go and penniless, he turns himself in to the police.
