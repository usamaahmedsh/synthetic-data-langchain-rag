The Riggs Award for Lifetime Achievement in International and Comparative Administration is an  academic award given annually by the Section on International and Comparative Administration of the American Society for Public Administration.
The Award is named in honor of Fred W. Riggs, a political scientist and pioneer in the field of comparative administration in the United States.  Riggs was the founder and first chairperson of the Comparative Administration Group, which was later reorganized as the Section on International and Comparative Administration of the American Society for Public Administration.  Riggs argued that “the new paradigm for public administration must be comparative, since the solution of the problem to which it addresses itself will require increasing communication between scholars and practitioners in all countries." Since 1986, the Award has been given annually to an individual "in recognition of lifetime scholarly achievement in the field of comparative and public administration."
