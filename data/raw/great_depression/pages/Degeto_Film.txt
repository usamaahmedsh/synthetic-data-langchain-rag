== History ==
The company was founded in 1928 as Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ton und Film e. V. and produced and distributed propaganda films for Hitler's Reich government in the 1930s and 1940s. It operated under the name Degeto – Kulturfilm G.m.b.H. from 1937, and from 1942 as Degeto Film GmbH. After reactivation in 1952 by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Hessischer Rundfunk (HR), the company was initially owned by Werbung im Rundfunk GmbH, a subsidiary of HR, from 1954 and was jointly taken over by the ARD broadcasters in 1959.
