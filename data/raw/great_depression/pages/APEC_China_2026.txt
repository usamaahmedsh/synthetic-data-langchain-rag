The APEC China 2026 will be a year-long hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings, which will conclude with the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in November 2026. It will be the third time China hosted the summit, having previously hosted in 2001 and 2014.


== Preparations ==
In November 2024, it was announced that China would host the APEC meeting in 2026. On 1 November 2025, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced that the 2026 APEC summit would be held in Shenzhen, which is a special economic zone in the province of Guangdong. Shenzhen is directly adjacent to fellow APEC member Hong Kong, which has never hosted the summit in its own right.
