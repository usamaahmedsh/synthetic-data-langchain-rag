In March 2025, it is reported that CK Hutchinson Holding would sell Hutchinson Port Holdings and Hutchinson Port Group Holdings. There are reports stating that the key buyer is the Aponte Italian shipping family, and "the crucial figure" is Diego Aponte, group president of Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), and chairman of the Terminal Investment Limited (TiL). Gianluigi Aponte, MSC's founder, was reportedly personally playing a role in brokering the potential deal. TiL and BlackRock are consortium partners in the port deal. This comes in the context of U.S. President Donald Trump denouncing Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and calling for the United States to reclaim control of the canal in some form or another. In July 2025, Panama's government filed two lawsuits against CK Hutchinson's local subsidiary in the country's supreme court.
