The 2025 Lebanese bank reformation refers to Lebanon undertaking significant reforms to its banking sector to address the profound financial crisis that began in 2019. These reforms aim to restore depositor confidence, comply with International Monetary Fund (IMF) requirements, and stabilize the nation's economy.


== Background ==
The Lebanese financial crisis, which escalated in 2019, led to a sovereign default in 2020 and a collapse of the banking system. This resulted in widespread loss of public trust, severe currency devaluation, and a shift towards a cash-based economy. Contributing factors included decades of mismanagement, corruption, the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Beirut port explosion, and a 14-month conflict with Israel. These events collectively caused approximately $11 billion in damages and economic losses.


== Key Reform Measures ==


=== Banking sector restructuring law ===
In April 2025, the Lebanese cabinet approved a comprehensive 39-clause banking reform law, marking a pivotal step in addressing the country's prolonged financial crisis. This legislation aims to restore confidence in the banking system, protect depositors, particularly small account holders. It aligns with the IMF's conditions and follows amendments to banking secrecy laws aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability.


=== Central bank leadership change ===
Karim A. Souaid was appointed as the new governor of the Banque du Liban (BdL) in March 2025. This marked a significant leadership change amid the country's ongoing financial crisis. Souaid, a financial expert with a background in private equity and banking governance, founder of Growthgate Equity Partners, brings extensive experience in banking governance and private equity investments across the Middle East. His appointment was endorsed by a majority of the cabinet, although it faced opposition from Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, who expressed concerns about Souaid's close ties to Lebanon's banking elite and potential conflicts of interest.
Upon taking office on April 4, 2025, Souaid pledged to fight money laundering and terrorism financing, restructure the banking sector, and prioritize the return of depositor funds, particularly for small account holders. He emphasized the need for banks to recapitalize or consider mergers and highlighted the importance of the central bank operating independently from political influence.


=== Depositor compensation strategy ===
In 2025, Lebanon is implementing a depositor compensation strategy aimed at addressing the financial crisis that began in 2019. The government's plan involves a collaborative effort among the state, the central bank (Banque du Liban), and commercial banks to repay depositors over time. Priority is given to small depositors, with the objective of restoring confidence in the banking sector and aligning with International Monetary Fund (IMF) requirements for financial assistance.
A key component under consideration is the establishment of a Deposit Recovery Fund (DRF). This fund would potentially issue zero-coupon bonds to depositors, redeemable after an extended period, such as 40 years. The aim is to provide a structured mechanism for deposit recovery, though the long-term nature of the bonds has raised concerns about the effectiveness and fairness of this approach.


=== Amendments to banking secrecy laws ===
In April 2025, Lebanon's Parliament approved significant amendments to the country's banking secrecy laws, aiming to enhance financial transparency and align with International Monetary Fund (IMF) requirements. These changes are part of broader efforts to address the nation's ongoing financial crisis and restore confidence in its banking sector.
Key Provisions of the Amendments:

Expanded Access to Banking Information: The amendments grant the Banking Control Commission the authority to access bank account data, including account holders' names, with retroactive effect for the past ten years. This measure is intended to enhance transparency and accountability, particularly in monitoring financial activities that may involve corrupt politicians attempting to conceal assets under different names.
Broadened Scope for Lifting Secrecy: Under the new law, authorities can access suspicious accounts using individuals' names, not just account numbers. This change facilitates investigations into financial crimes such as corruption, money laundering, and tax evasion.
Retroactive Application: The law applies retroactively to bank accounts dating back to 2015, allowing authorities to investigate financial activities during the early stages of Lebanon's financial crisis.
Alignment with IMF Requirements  The amendments to the banking secrecy laws are a crucial step toward meeting the IMF's conditions for financial assistance. By enhancing transparency and accountability in the financial sector, Lebanon aims to unlock much-needed international support and aid in its economic recovery efforts.


=== Engagement with international creditors ===
In 2025, Lebanon is actively preparing to engage with international creditors to address its sovereign debt crisis, following its default on approximately $31 billion in international bonds in March 2020. Finance Minister Yassine Jaber has indicated that while no meetings with bondholders are scheduled during the IMF–World Bank Spring Meetings, the government aims to initiate discussions with international bondholders within the next year. The focus is currently on implementing fundamental reforms, including overhauling the banking sector and improving revenue collection, to create a conducive environment for meaningful debt negotiations.
A key creditor group, comprising major institutional investors such as BlackRock and Fidelity, has reassembled and appointed financial advisers in anticipation of upcoming debt talks. This group's involvement is significant, as they hold a substantial portion of Lebanon's bonds, making them critical players in any restructuring process.


=== IMF's stance on lebanon's reform efforts ===
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has acknowledged Lebanon's recent efforts toward economic reform but maintains that these measures are insufficient to resolve the country's ongoing financial crisis. In a statement from May 2024, the IMF highlighted that while steps such as reducing inflation and stabilizing the exchange rate have been taken, critical issues like the frozen state of bank deposits and the inability of the banking sector to provide credit persist. The IMF emphasized the need for a credible and financially viable strategy to address banking sector losses, protect depositors, and limit the use of scarce public resources. Without such comprehensive reforms, the economy remains vulnerable, and recovery efforts are hindered.
Furthermore, the IMF has stressed the importance of a comprehensive economic strategy encompassing fiscal and debt sustainability, financial sector restructuring, and reforms in governance and state-owned enterprises. Data transparency is also deemed crucial to inform policymaking and qualify for an assistance program. Lebanon's government has formally requested a new IMF program, and discussions are ongoing to finalize a loan agreement.


== Al-Qard Al-Hassan banning ==
As part of the reformation it was reported on July 14, 2025, that Banque du Liban, has issued a circular prohibiting all licensed financial institutions from engaging in any direct or indirect dealings with Al‑Qard Al‑Hassan, Hezbollah’s Iran-backed financial arm. Though Al‑Qard Al‑Hassan positions itself as a charitable microfinance institution offering interest‑free loans, it has long been under U.S. sanctions for acting as a covert conduit for Hezbollah to channel funds globally . The decision follows escalating international pressure and past Israeli strikes on its branches, reinforcing scrutiny over Hezbollah’s role in Lebanon’s financial system.


== 2025 IMF–World Bank Spring meetings ==
In April 2025, a Lebanese delegation participated in the IMF–World Bank Spring Meetings in Washington, D.C., where it presented a unified reform vision aimed at addressing Lebanon’s protracted financial and economic crisis. The delegation, led by Finance Minister Yassine Jaber, included the Minister of Economy, the Governor of Banque du Liban, and senior presidential advisors. This marked a notable shift from previous years, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) positively noting the coherence and clarity in Lebanon’s reform approach.
The delegation outlined a series of proposed reforms covering areas such as tax policy, social security, economic restructuring, and monetary governance. Banque du Liban Governor Karim A. Souaid emphasized the importance of preserving the central bank’s independence and safeguarding the rights of small depositors.
While IMF officials welcomed the renewed seriousness of the Lebanese side, they reiterated that progress would depend on effective implementation—something that had hindered past negotiations due to political divisions and legislative inaction. Further discussions were held with IMF Middle East and Central Asia Director Jihad Azour. In addition, Lebanon sought support through a proposed $1 billion World Bank loan to assist in post-conflict reconstruction and the establishment of a national social safety net. According to the delegation, the reform proposals were internally driven and framed as essential for the country's economic recovery and long-term stability, rather than merely a response to external pressures.


=== Meetings outcome ===
Following the meetings, Lebanon secured a $250 million loan from the World Bank to alleviate its chronic electricity shortages. The funds will be used to improve electricity bill collection and invest in solar energy projects, potentially saving $40 million annually. This initiative is part of a broader $1 billion reconstruction program, with preliminary approval to increase the loan to $400 million.
