== Markets outside Hong Kong ==
In recent years, CLP has sought to expand outside of its native Hong Kong, accomplishing this through mergers and acquisitions. Markets outside Hong Kong it has entered include Australia (through EnergyAustralia), India, Mainland China, Southeast Asia mainly (Thailand and Indonesia) and Taiwan.
Its first market outside Hong Kong was mainland China; by way of connecting its power stations in Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland grid, CLP began supplying power in 1979.
The 1990s saw the start of expansionary M&A activity with CLP acquiring nearly a half-dozen companies between 1996 and 2005. In 1996 the company entered joint-ventures with Taiwan Cement Corporation; in 1998, part ownership of Thai Electricity Generating Public Co Ltd; and in 2001, Australian Yallourn Energy. It expanded operations in Australia to include retailing when it bought TXU Merchant Energy in 2005. And in 2002 CLP acquired an Indian company, Gujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation Private Limited.
