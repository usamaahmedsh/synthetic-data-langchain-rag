== Background, academic and political career ==

== The economic policy mix applied under the leadership of Alogoskoufis ==
In the period in which Alogoskoufis served as the minister for Economy and Finance, he actuated a series of economic structural reforms and fiscal adjustment to contain budget deficits, which, although unpopular, have failed to slash Greece's high 2004 budget deficit (from 5.7% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2008). In the same period of time, Greece's gross domestic product has grown by one of the highest growth rates in the Eurozone. Unemployment also fell significantly.
During 2004–2007, marginal corporate and personal income taxes were reduced. He worked extensively with the private sector  and sold over euro 6 billion of government holdings. However, these reforms did not prove sufficient to avert Greece external debt crisis in 2010.


== Criticism ==
George Alogoskoufis has been accused of falsifying Greece's economical data during his tenure, an exercise referred to as "Greek Statistics", which led to the county's bankruptcy in 2010.
George Alogoskoufis was pelted with eggs by Greek left wing activists at a meeting held at the London School of Economics on 14 November 2008. The activists threw the eggs as a protest against the Greek government.[1]
