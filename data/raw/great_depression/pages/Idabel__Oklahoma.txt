Idabel is a city in and the county seat of McCurtain County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 6,961 at the 2020 census. It is in Oklahoma's southeast corner, a tourist region known as Choctaw Country.


== History ==

Idabel was established in 1902 as a station by the Arkansas and Choctaw Railway. (This was later part of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, and the line is now operated by the Kiamichi Railroad).
The city was first named "Purnell", after Isaac Purnell, a railroad official. When postal officials rejected that designation, the name was changed to "Mitchell", honoring another railroad company officer. Postal officials rejected that name because another post office of the same name already existed elsewhere in the territory. They named the post office Bokhoma (a Choctaw word meaning Red River); it opened December 15, 1902.
Railroad officials then chose the name Idabel, a compound of the names of Isaac Purnell's two daughters, Ida and Bell. The post office was renamed as Idabel.
At the time of its founding, Idabel was located in Bok Tuklo County, a part of the Apukshunubbee District of the Choctaw Nation, within what was known as Indian Territory.
For the first four years, Idabel local government was conducted by the Choctaw tribe for its people. The federal government had legal jurisdiction in most matters over non-Choctaws. In 1906, the citizens elected their first mayor and established a mayor-council form of government.
At the time of statehood, November 16, 1907, the town was designated as the county seat of McCurtain County. A census in that year reported 726 residents. By 1910, the population had grown to 1,493. In 1920, there were 3,617 residents, but the number fell to 2,581 in 1930. Growth resumed by the end of the Great Depression in the late 1930s.
The death of Henry Lee Johnson in 1980 resulted in a riot in the town that resulted in two deaths.
Idabel residents elected their first African-American mayor in April 2019, mayor Craig Young.

== Economy ==
Initially, timber was the basis for the local economy, but this was supplanted by cotton production after the nearby forests were cleared. One cotton gin operated in Idabel in 1904, but six were in business in 1930. However, the Great Depression, depleted soil and destructive pests essentially wiped out this industry around Idabel. Landowners converted their properties to pastures and expanded beef production. Chicken farms were also established in the area and marginal agricultural land was turned into pine plantations.
