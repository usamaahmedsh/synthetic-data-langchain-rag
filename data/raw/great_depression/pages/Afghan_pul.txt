Afghan pul  (Pashto: پول [pol]; Dari: پل [pʰʊl]) is the one-hundredth subdivision of the Afghan afghani, which has been the official currency of Afghanistan since the 1920s. All pul coins have been demonetized.


== History ==
Until the 1920s, the currency of Afghanistan was the Afghan rupee, which was subdivided into paisa. In 1923, the rupee was replaced by afghani as its official currency. One afghani is subdivided into 100 puls. At the time of introduction, a pul coin was made of copper and weighed one gram. However, a 10 pul coin weighed 6 grams.
