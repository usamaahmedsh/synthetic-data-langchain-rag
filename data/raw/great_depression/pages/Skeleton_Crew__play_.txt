Skeleton Crew is a play written by Dominique Morisseau about an auto factory on the brink of closure in 2008 Detroit, Michigan. It is the third part of Morisseau's Detroit Project, inspired by African-American playwrights, which also includes Paradise Blue and Detroit '67.

Skeleton Crew ran Off-Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company in 2016 and subsequently at the Detroit Public Theatre in 2017. The Atlantic production was also directed by Santiago-Hudson.
It ran on Broadway as a limited-run engagement at Manhattan Theatre Club's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre from December 2021 through February 2022 under the direction of Ruben Santiago-Hudson and starred Phylicia Rashad as Faye. It was one of a series of Broadway shows in the 2021–2022 season written by Black playwrights, and parallels were identified between the play's story and the Omicron surge under which its run fell.
Skeleton Crew premiered in the United Kingdom at the Donmar Warehouse in July 2024 for a one-month run, directed by Matthew Xia.
