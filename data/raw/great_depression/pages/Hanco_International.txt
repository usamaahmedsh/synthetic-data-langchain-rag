In 1926, Frank Hannon opened a small electrical shop in Canton, Ohio. The northeast Ohio region is well known for mineral resources of clay, coal, and limestone as well as the steel, brick and rubber industries. F.R. Hannon & Sons was the trade name created to serve these local industries. These local products and services evolved into what is known around the world today as Hanco International ([1]).
Throughout the years, many different products such as stack draft fans, kiln cooling fans, and quick disconnect plugs were all manufactured. In the late 1940s, Hanco developed several products that continue in production today.
Today, Hanco International products are sold and serviced throughout the world.
