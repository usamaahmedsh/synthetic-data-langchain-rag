Hot Chocolates is a musical revue with music by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks and book by Andy Razaf. It was originally titled Tan Town Topics in hopes it would be picked up by Broadway. Performed at the Hudson Theater in New York City, it was directed by Leonard Harper and ran for 219 performances from June 20, 1929, to December 14, 1929. It is also referred to as Connie's Hot Chocolates. It was staged, directed and produced by Leonard Harper. While the revue featured music and singing, including the subsequent hit "Ain't Misbehavin''", it was praised for the cast's dancing, including its male and female chorus lines.
Louis Armstrong made his Broadway debut as part of the show's ensemble.  Cab Calloway later joined the cast as a replacement at Armstrong's recommendation. Calloway later adopted the song "(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue," originally sung by Edith Wilson, for his performances decades later.
