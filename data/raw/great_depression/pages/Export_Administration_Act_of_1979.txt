The Export Administration Act (EAA) of 1979 (P.L. 96-72) authorized to the President to control U.S. exports for national security, foreign policy, and short supply purposes. The EAA, like its predecessors, contained a sunset provision, and, beginning in the mid-1980s, Congress let the EAA lapse several times. Each time, the President kept controls on exports in force by declaring an emergency under the National Emergencies Act and invoking authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
The Act was mostly repealed by the Export Control Reform Act of 2018. That law provided a statutory basis for the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and did not include any sunset provisions. However, "because the implementation of certain sanctions authorities, including sections 11A, 11B, and 11C of the Export Administration Act ... is to be carried out under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act," the president must continue to use IEEPA to maintain the national emergency under which those sanctions were implemented.


== Regulation forbidding Anti-Israel boycotts ==
The U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security is charged with enforcing and administering the anti-boycott laws under the Export Administration Act.
"Those laws discourage, and in some circumstances, prohibit U.S. companies from furthering or supporting the boycott of Israel sponsored by the Arab League, and certain Muslim countries, including complying with certain requests for information designed to verify compliance with the boycott."
