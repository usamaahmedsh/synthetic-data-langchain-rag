== History ==
The area of Mineral Ridge was primarily a farming community, with some coal mining in the 1830s. In the mid-1850s, John Lewis, superintendent of the Mineral Ridge Coal Mines, discovered black band iron ore beneath the layers of coal ore, leading to a boom of companies working with the blast furnaces of Brier Hill, Niles, and later, Mineral Ridge itself. The main deposit of iron for Youngstown’s growing steel industry, this iron was known as “American Scotch Pig” and “Warner’s Scotch Pig.”
By the late 19th century, the mining industry was largely in decline and Mineral Ridge disincorporated in 1917. However, some mines did still operate into the Great Depression.
