== History ==


=== Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets ===
The company was founded in 1999 as Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets Co. Ltd., a joint venture between Daiwa Securities Group (Daiwa) and Sumitomo Bank (SB). It was renamed in 2001 to Daiwa Securities SMBC Co. Ltd., after Sumitomo Bank merged with Sakura Bank on 1 April 2001 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG). However, in 2010, SMBC acquired Nikko Cordial (Japan's third-largest brokerage at that time). 


=== Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Company ===
Following this step, Daiwa dissolved the joint-venture with SMBC and re-acquired 100% of the shares in the company, before renaming it again as Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. Ltd. Finally, about two years later, the company was absorbed in a merger, leaving Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd as the sole entity.


=== DC Advisory ===
In May 2009, Daiwa acquired the corporate finance division of Close Brothers Group. In 2010, it was renamed to DC Advisory and now acts as the corporate finance arm of Daiwa.
