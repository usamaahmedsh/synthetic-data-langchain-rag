Although settlers had established ranches in the area in the 1870s, Milford was not developed until after construction of the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, which established a station here in 1880. In that year, Arvin Stoddard moved here and surveyed a townsite. Milford is a constructed name, formed from mill and ford.
During the Great Depression, workers from a nearby Civilian Conservation Corps camp constructed a road from Milford to Beaver, to improve connections.
