== History ==
In the early 1920s, T. F. Jackson opened a two-room clinic on the second floor of the Touchton building in Dade City, Florida. In late October 1926, he purchased the former house of Reverend H. N. Abraham for his practice. He later moved it again several years later to a building west of Pasco Middle School. On August 1, 1934, Pasco County, Florida purchased the facility and renamed it Jackson Memorial Hospital, in remembrance of the founder who died the same year. Over the years several wings were added. In 1961, the older portion of the hospital was demolished.
In 1981, Adventist Health System Sunbelt Healthcare Corporation purchased the hospital. In January 1985, it was moved to Zephyrhills and was renamed East Pasco Medical Center. The property in Dade City was purchased by the county for its health department, later the social services department and the Sheriff's Office also moved into  the former medical facility.
In 1999, East Pasco Medical Center expanded its emergency department, before it was expanded the hospital rejected patients, forcing them to go to Columbia Dade City Hospital.
