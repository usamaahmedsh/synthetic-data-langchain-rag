The APEC South Korea 2025 (officially stylized as APEC 2025 Korea) was a year-long hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings, which concluded with the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting on November 1, 2025. It was the second time South Korea hosted the summit, having previously hosted in 2005.


== Preparations ==

In March 2024, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs formed the 2025 APEC Summit Host City Selection Committee and began the process of selecting the host city. The committee was led by Yoon Jin-sik, chairperson of the Korea International Trade Association, and had 17 members including government officials and private members. At the second meeting of the selection committee the same month, applications from each local government were reviewed, and Gyeongju, Incheon and Jeju Province were selected as the three finalists.
On May 28, the South Korean government held a ceremony to unveil the 2025 APEC Summit Preparation Committee and began full-scale preparations. This committee had 33 members ranging from government ministries and economic organizations.
In June, the host city was finally confirmed as Gyeongju. In August, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' APEC Preparatory Planning Team, including Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul visited Gyeongju and inspected key facilities to be used during the summit. The Gyeongju Hwabaek International Convention Center was used as the main conference hall.


== Global Political Context ==


=== 1.  Shifting Power Relations in the Asia-Pacific ===
The 2025 APEC Leaders' Meeting takes place at a time when political and economic relations in the Asia-Pacific region are being reshaped.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, structural limitations in global production networks have become evident, as the manufacturing of key goods—such as medical supplies, semiconductors, and batteries—was highly concentrated in a few regions. This experience revealed the fragility of existing supply chains and has been widely recognized as a turning point in global supply chain restructuring, emphasizing diversification and resilience. As a result, many economies adopted policies to diversify production bases and strengthen supply stability.
During this period, technological competition among states expanded, particularly in strategic sectors such as semiconductors, digital technology, and energy transition.
These changes have also affected the structure and focus of cooperation within the Asia-Pacific region. While APEC's core agenda previously centered on trade liberalization and economic growth, new priorities have emerged, including supply chain resilience, technological standards, and economic security.
The United States, under its Indo-Pacific Strategy and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) has promoted cooperation aimed at reducing excessive dependence on specific countries for critical supply chains. For example, the production and sourcing of strategic goods—such as semiconductors, batteries, and critical minerals are being diversified toward allied and trusted partner economies.
In this process, the concept of "friend-shoring" has gained importance. Unlike the traditional model of global offshoring, which placed production in low-cost regions, friend-shoring refers to restructuring supply chains among countries that share political stability and common values or governance norms. It emphasizes stability and reliability over efficiency, representing a new model of economic cooperation and a key trend in post-pandemic global supply chain restructuring.
Amid these adjustments, APEC continues to provide a venue for dialogue among major economies, including the United States and China. As a non-binding, consensus-based forum, it enables members to exchange information and coordinate approaches on cross-cutting issues that link economic and security concerns.
The 2025 Leaders' Meeting in the Republic of Korea will take place under the theme "Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect, Innovate, Prosper", reflecting ongoing cooperation on matters such as supply chain transparency and digital capacity development within the region.


=== 2.  Economic Security within Interdependent Economies ===
Economic security has become an increasingly important policy priority among APEC member economies as global interdependence has deepened.
The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent geopolitical tensions revealed structural vulnerabilities in global production systems, showing that the manufacturing of critical goods such as semiconductors, batteries, and medical supplies was heavily concentrated in a small number of economies.
Disruptions in these sectors during 2020–2022 demonstrated how localized shutdowns could have far-reaching impacts on international trade and production, prompting governments to develop strategies that enhance the resilience, transparency, and diversification of their supply chains.
In response, many economies have pursued legislative and institutional initiatives to secure access to key technologies and materials.
The United States, for example, enacted the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022 to support domestic semiconductor fabrication, advanced manufacturing, and clean-energy supply chains.
The CHIPS Act provides federal funding and tax incentives for semiconductor research, development, and production while restricting subsidized firms from expanding certain advanced operations in foreign jurisdictions of concern.
Meanwhile, the IRA links eligibility for clean-energy tax credits to specific sourcing requirements—such as the use of materials extracted or processed within North America or from partner economies with free trade agreements—thereby promoting supply chain realignment toward trusted partners.
Similarly, Japan adopted the Economic Security Promotion Act in 2022, which established mechanisms for securing stable supplies of designated essential goods, protecting critical infrastructure, and supporting the development of advanced technologies.
Together, these policies represent a broader shift toward integrating economic stability and industrial competitiveness into national security frameworks—a trend increasingly reflected in policy dialogues across the Asia-Pacific.
Within this evolving context, APEC functions as a platform for voluntary cooperation on issues that connect economic policy and security concerns. Recent APEC meetings and working groups have included discussions on supply chain transparency, access to critical materials, data security in logistics systems, and the resilience of digital infrastructure. Through its non-binding and consensus-based approach, APEC enables member economies to exchange information, share policy experiences, and coordinate best practices without imposing formal obligations.
As the host of the 2025 APEC Leaders' Meeting, the Republic of Korea is expected to continue advancing these discussions under the theme "Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect, Innovate, Prosper," focusing on collaborative approaches to economic security that strengthen interdependence and regional cooperation rather than restrict them.
3.  Technological Governance in Global Affairs
As technology becomes a central driver of economic growth and regional competitiveness, governance of the digital economy has emerged as a major area of cooperation within APEC. Member economies increasingly recognize that policies on data flows, privacy protection, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity are closely linked to trade, innovation, and economic security. Rather than establishing binding rules, APEC serves as a platform for voluntary coordination, enabling its members to share experiences and align approaches to digital policy.
Through bodies such as the Digital Economy Steering Group (DESG) and policy frameworks such as the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap (AIDER), APEC promotes dialogue on issues including cross-border data flows, digital trade facilitation, and consumer protection in online environments.
The Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System, first launched under APEC in 2011, provides a non-binding framework that allows certified companies to transfer personal data among participating economies while maintaining agreed privacy standards.
This system has since evolved into the Global CBPR Forum, in which several APEC members continue to participate, reflecting the region's role in shaping international digital-governance norms.
APEC has strengthened its cooperation in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the digital economy. In 2025, the forum held its first Ministerial Meeting on Digital and AI in Incheon, where ministers from 21 member economies discussed ways to foster innovation, expand digital connectivity, and ensure the safe use of AI technologies.
Alongside the ministerial discussions, capacity-building workshops and technical dialogues were organized on topics including broadband access, AI utilization, and inclusive digital infrastructure. These initiatives aim to promote regulatory coherence and develop shared standards that encourage innovation while maintaining trust and safety in the digital environment. The forum's emphasis on open, trusted, and inclusive digital ecosystems aligns with APEC's long-standing commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth.
The 2025 APEC Leaders' Meeting, hosted by the Republic of Korea under the theme "Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect, Innovate, Prosper," is expected to continue this work by highlighting innovation-driven connectivity and responsible technological governance as cross-cutting priorities. Through these discussions, APEC continues to function as a venue where member economies exchange information and coordinate practices on digital transformation—strengthening regional connectivity without imposing formal obligations.


== Participants ==
APEC South Korea 2025 was the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting for U.S. president Donald Trump in his second presidency, who re-assumed the presidency on January 20, 2025; Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, who assumed the premiership on March 14; South Korean president and host Lee Jae Myung, who assumed office on June 4; and Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi, who assumed the premiership on October 21.
Republic of China leader Lai Ching-te appointed Lin Hsin-i as Chinese Taipei's representative to the summit, marking Lin's third time representing Chinese Taipei at the summit.
Russian president Vladimir Putin did not attend the summit, as South Korea is a state party to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has issued an arrest warrant against Putin over alleged war crimes related to the Russo-Ukrainian war. It was therefore highly likely that South Korea's Ministry of Justice would be obligated to implement the warrant should Putin enter the country. As a result, Russian deputy prime minister Alexey Overchuk represented Russia at the summit, as he had done in 2023 and in 2024.
It's also the second APEC meeting which Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum (who assumed the presidency on October 1, 2024, after opting to skip the 2024 APEC meeting in Peru) and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister James Marape didn't attend in-person, and both designated Mexican Economic Secretary Marcelo Ebrard and Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso as their respective representatives. Peruvian president José Jerí, who took office on October 10, also didn't participate in-person and designed Foreign Trade and Tourism Minister Teresa Mera Gómez as his representative to the summit.
Trump did not attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting (AELM), participating only in the APEC CEO Summit and the U.S.–APEC Leaders' Working Dinner before departing South Korea on October 30. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent represented the U.S. at the AELM.
Thai prime minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who assumed office on September 7, was initially expected to skip his first APEC meeting following the death of Queen Sirikit The Queen Mother on October 24, 2025. Her passing prompted a year-long mourning period for Thai government officials and a 90-day mourning period for the general public. However, Anutin later reversed his decision and attended the summit as initially planned.
