Petroleum, natural gas, and coal are exported from various source countries to countries reliant on these fossil fuels. Fossil fuel exports are dominated by a relatively small group of countries, many of which derive a significant portion of their export revenues and government income from these resources.
According to Climate Action Tracker, in 2022 the ten largest fossil fuel exporters are responsible for roughly 60% of all exported fossil fuel emissions. Russia contributes the most to global emissions from fossil fuel exports overall, due to its large exports of oil, gas, and coal. Australia and Indonesia are major coal exporters, while the United States leads in emissions from gas exports and Saudi Arabia in those from oil. Together, the top six exporters (Russia, Australia, the US, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Canada) account for half of all fossil fuel export-related emissions.
Coal trade was expected to reach an all-time high in 2024. Asia Pacific accounting for 84% of global coal imports in 2023.
