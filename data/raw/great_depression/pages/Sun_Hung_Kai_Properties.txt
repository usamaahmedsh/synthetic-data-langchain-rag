== History ==


=== Early years ===
The predecessor of the group, Sun Hung Kai Enterprises Co., Ltd. (Chinese: 新鴻基企業有限公司), was founded in 1963 by Kwok Tak-seng, together with Fung King-hey and Lee Shau Kee.

== Business development ==


=== Projects ===

In 1996, SHKP was the lead developer which had bid the sum of HK$5.5 billion to acquire the rights to develop Hong Kong's second-tallest building, the International Finance Centre. The MTR Corporation was a partner in the venture. Sun Hung Kai Properties, owns 47.5 per cent of the development, Henderson Land Development, whose chairman Lee Shau Kee sits on the SHKP board, took a 32.5 per cent stake in the project. SHKP also built the International Commerce Centre, the tallest building in Hong Kong.


=== Internal sale opacity ===
In 2005, the developer was criticised for the lack of transparency in its public sale of residential properties to speculators and end-users. The company was accused of the practice of "internal sales" of uncompleted units, the absence of sale price-lists, and also for hyping sales for flats in its The Arch development in West Kowloon by announcing inflated prices (per square metre) achieved. A buyer apparently paid HK$168 million, or HK$31,300 per square foot, for a 5,360-square-foot (498 m2) penthouse. Sweeteners were allegedly given (discounts given to the same purchaser on other units bought), but were excluded from the calculation. This allowed SHK to raise prices of the next batch of 500 units by 5–10 percent. But SHKP has denied the allegations.


=== Sibling fallout ===
On 18 February 2008, SHKP announced that Walter Kwok, chairman and chief executive, would take a "temporary leave of absence for personal reasons with immediate effect". Walter Kwok announced that he would take a "personal holiday", handing over his duties to his two younger brothers.
The Standard reported that the elder Kwok was removed from his position by his mother, who is the controlling shareholder of the company, to protect the family interests. The journal revealed that Walter's mistress of 4 years has been wielding increasing power in the business, and causing friction with his brothers.
The day after SHKP's announcement, its stock price declined against the general market. Corporate communications issued a second statement insisting that the business would not be affected and that Walter would resume his functions after his leave of 2 to 3 months. Walter's mistress, named by the press as Ida Tong Kam-Hing (唐錦馨), had apparently introduced property transactions valued at HK$4 billion to the Group or to the Kwoks' private investment vehicles. Company spokesmen stated that no person named Ida Tong was employed by the Group.
On 29 February, tycoon and fellow board member Lee Shau Kee confirmed that Mrs. Kwok forced the leave of absence upon Walter over Ida Tong during the last board meeting.
On 16 May 2008, Walter filed a writ with the High Court which claimed that Walter reached an agreement with his mother and two brothers in February that he would return to his duties if certain conditions were met. Walter alleged that his two brothers violated the agreement by attempting to remove him despite having fulfilled the predefined criteria, including procuring at least two medical opinions showing he is fit to return. Walter secured a last-minute injunction to delay the vote, to allow more time for discussions. On the sidelines of the dispute to remove Walter as chairman and CEO, Walter and his brothers claim the other(s) made major management decisions unwisely and without consultation.

==== ICC ====
The International Commerce Centre (ICC) in West Kowloon is the tallest building in Hong Kong, standing at 490m with 118 storeys. The development was also chosen as one of the world's top 125 most important works of architecture by Architectural Record in commemoration of the magazine's 125th anniversary.
The tower opened in 2011. While most of the building is leased out as office spaces – ICC provides 2.5 million square feet of office space –  the building also houses the Sky100 Hong Kong Observation Deck on the 100th floor as well as restaurants on the 101st floor, with the former providing a 360-degree view over the Victoria Harbour at 393 metres above the sea level. The Ritz-Carlton hotel occupies the building's 102nd to 118th floor. The world's highest swimming pool is located on the top floor as part of the hotel.
The building also has LED lights on its facades for a light show, which has set a Guinness World Record for the "largest light and sound show on a single building". The show occurs twice a night, and can be viewed along both sides of the Victoria Harbour.
The SHKP Vertical Run for Charity has been an annual event hosted by SHKP at ICC since 2012.


==== IFC ====
The International Finance Centre is an integrated commercial development, which includes the currently second tallest building in Hong Kong, only next to ICC. Situated above the Hong Kong MTR station, the project was developed and owned by IFC Development, a consortium with SHKP as one of the members. The IFC project was completed in September 2006, providing a gross floor area of over 4 million square feet in total. It consists of two office towers – One IFC and Two IFC – the Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong, and the IFC mall. Notable occupants of the development include the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which purchased 14 floors in Two IFC in 2001.
The ifc mall in the IFC development has 4 floors of luxury retail shops and restaurants. It is also where Hong Kong's first Apple retail store is located.


==== Millennium City ====
Millennium City is a multi-tower development project built along the Kwun Tong Road. By 2016, Phases 1–3, 5 and 6 have been completed.
Millennium City 1, the first to be completed and the largest of the Millennium City cluster, comprises a twin pair of 30-storey towers. The two towers combined provide a total of 1,230,000 square feet of commercial space.


==== New Town Plaza ====
New Town Plaza is an SHKP development located in Sha Tin, Hong Kong. The development project was completed in three phases (Phase 1: 9-storey shopping mall; Phase 2: Royal Park Hotel; Phase 3: private housing and a 3-storey shopping mall). New Town Plaza was the largest development of its kind in New Territories at its time of completion in the 1980s.
Royal Park Hotel is connected to the metro station and New Town Plaza mall via a covered walkway and is close to local attractions such as Che Kung Temple, Sha Tin Racecourse and the Hong Kong Heritage Museum. Royal Park Hotel hosted Olympians competing in equestrian programmes during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympic Games.


==== apm ====
Opened in March 2005, apm is one of the largest shopping malls targeted at a younger generation of consumers. The name APM is an amalgamation of AM and PM, reflecting how the shops in the mall operate with extended hours, allowing consumers to shop even at hours when most others shops are closed. APM has a lot of retail shops, restaurants and entertainment options, most of the open at least until midnight.
In tune with the theme of being young and trendy, APM houses retail brands that are typically tailored for a younger audience. A cinema, game zone and a karaoke bar are some of the other amenities that visitors can find in the mall.


==== Airport Freight Forwarding Centre ====


==== Transitional housing project - United Court ====
SHKP announced that it will lease three plots of land to non-governmental organizations for 8 years for a nominal sum of HK$1. The donation will yield around 2,000 social housing units for low-income families waiting for public housing. The company will team up with the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Welfare Council for the biggest project called United Court. When completed in 2022, United Court would provide homes for 1,600 families and ultimately benefit 5,000 families.


== Other businesses ==
The company also has complimentary operations in the following property-related fields:

Hotels
Property management
Telecommunications
Information technology
Infrastructure and other businesses
It was once reported in a local newspaper that the company and Cheung Kong (Holdings) are together increasingly dominant in the development of new private homes, accounting for 70% of the market in 2010, up from around half of that in 2003. This concentration, with much of the rest of the market occupied by other very large firms, is attributed to the government's policy of auctioning land inexpensively large blocks, squeezing out small and mid-sized firms, according to the Consumer Council.
Nevertheless, clarification was later made in the letters to editors column in the same newspaper that Sun Hung Kai Properties' overall share of primary residential sales in terms of attributable value from January to July 2010 has been approximately 20% – a figure that has been largely stable over the last few years.
