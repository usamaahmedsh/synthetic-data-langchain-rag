"There'll Be Some Changes Made" ("Changes") is a popular song by Benton Overstreet (composer) and Billy Higgins  (lyricist). Published in 1921, the song has flourished in several genres, particularly jazz. The song has endured for as many years as a jazz standard. According to the online The Jazz Discography (an index of jazz-only recordings), "Changes" had been recorded 404 times as of May 2018. The song and its record debut were revolutionary, in that the songwriters (Overstreet and Higgins, the original copyright publisher, Harry Herbert Pace, the vocalist to first record it (Ethel Waters), the owners of Black Swan (the record label), the opera singer (Elizabeth Greenfield) for whom the label was named, and the musicians on the recording led by Fletcher Henderson, were all African American. The production is identified by historians as a notable part of the Harlem Renaissance.


== History and popularity milestones ==


=== 1920s ===
The debut recording with Ethel Waters was recorded on Black Swan Records (1921) and rapidly became a hit.  Her rendition features the rarely-heard 6-bar instrumental intro, followed by her singing the 1st verse (16 bars, plus 1), then her singing the 1st chorus (16 bars, plus 2), then instruments playing 8, plus 2 bars of the chorus, finishing with her singing the 1st chorus (16 bars, plus 2).
Variety magazine, in a fifty-year commemorative issue, included Ethel Waters' recording in its "Hit Parade of a Half-Century (1905–1955)" list for 1923.  A 1924 recording by Marion Harris (Brunswick 2651) helped establish it as a standard. Other artists with notable recordings during the 1920s include Josie Miles (Ajax 17087; 1924), Sophie Tucker (Okeh 40921; 1927), and the Chicago Rhythm Kings (Red McKenzie, vocalist; Brunswick 4001; 1928).  In jazz discography, which does not include the recordings of Marion Harris or Sophie Tucker, there were 11 recordings of the song during the 1920s.


=== 1930s ===
Standout recordings from the 1930s include Fats Waller (Bluebird B10322; 1935), Pee Wee Russell's Rhythmakers (HRS (de) 1000; 1938), and Benny Goodman and His Orchestra (Louise Tobin, vocalist, Fletcher Henderson arrangement; Columbia 35210; 1939).  In jazz discography, there were 17 recordings of the song during the 1930s, including double takes by (i) Benny Carter and His Swing Quintet (Masters of Jazz (F)MJCD95 CD & Vocalion S46), (ii) Pee Wee Russell's Rhythmakers (both takes on HRS 1001; 1938), (iii) Benny Goodman And His Orchestra (Columbia 35210 & Phontastic (Swd)NOST7606; 1939), and (iv) Eddie Condon And His Chicagoans (Decca 18041 & Meritt 11; 1939).


=== 1940s ===
1941 was not a good year for newly published popular music due to the ASCAP strike.  According to a January 31, 1942, Billboard article, ASCAP members claimed only 2 of the top 13 sellers in sheet music.  Five of the remaining 11 were revivals, one of which was "There'll Be Some Changes Made."  The 1941 film, Play Girl, gave new life to the song.  In 1941, Benny Goodman's 1939 version became a Billboard No. 1 Hit for 4 weeks (during April and May) and peaked at No. 2 on Your Hit Parade.  In 1961, BMI published a list, "All-Time Hit Songs, Broadcast Music, Inc., 1940–1960," in Billboard.  "There'll Be Some Changes Made" was among the 17 songs listed for 1947.  In jazz discography, there were 60 recordings of the song during the 1940s.
Notable recordings from the 1940s include Vaughn Monroe and His Orchestra (Marilyn Duke, vocalist; Bluebird B-11025-A; 1941), the Hoosier Hot Shots (Okeh 6114; 1941) and Peggy Lee (Capitol 15001; 1947).


=== 1950s ===
In early 1959, Billie Holiday did three sessions with Ray Ellis and orchestra for MGM Records in New York: March 3, 4, and 11.  She recorded "Changes" in the final session.  That session turned out to be the last studio session of her life.  She died 4 months and 6 days later — on July 17.  The album — released under various titles, notably, Last Recording (MGM SE-3764; 1959) — was posthumously released.
In jazz discography, there were 42 recordings of "Changes" during the 1950s.


=== 1960s – current ===
Notable artists who recorded "Changes" include Ann-Margret on her 1962 album The Vivacious One, Jaki Byard (Muse 5007; 1972), Tony Bennett (Improv 7112; 1973–1977) and Fox Face (Dirtnap Records ZZZ-163; 2021)


=== 2000 ===
In 2004, Tony Bennett sang the song again at the Montreux Jazz Festival with the Phil Collins Big Band accompanied by pianist Ralph Sharon and double bassist Douglas Richeson, which can be heard on Collins's four-CD box set Plays Well with Others released in 2018.


=== Western swing and country western ===
Outside of jazz, in western swing, Bob Wills recorded it in 1937 (Vocalion DAL 244-1).  In country music, Chet Atkins and Mark Knopfler recorded — on their 1990 Grammy award winning album Neck and Neck — a parody version that references the Dire Straits song "Money for Nothing"  ...

== Selected videography, filmography, and stage ==
Feature films

Use of the song in the 1941 film, Play Girl, helped repopularize the song 20 years after its debut.
Ida Lupino sang the song in the 1948 film, Road House
Joan Blondell sang the song in the 1951 film, The Blue Veil
In the 1972 film Slaughterhouse-Five, a quartet is singing the song when the airplane Billy Pilgrim is traveling in spins out of control and crashes.
Ann Reinking sang and danced to the song accompanied by Leland Palmer and Erzsébet Földi during the "Hallucination Sequence" in the 1979 film, All That Jazz, directed by Bob Fosse. Reinking, Fosse's previous partner, directs the song to Roy Scheider playing Joe Gideon, a semi-autobiographical version of Fosse himself.

In the scene, Emmet Ray, played by Sean Penn in the lead role as a guitarist, is playing the song with his quintet at a club as he is approached by a woman with black hair.

Notes on the Tatum recording
† "There'll Be Some Changes Made," was recorded in 1941 on acetate discs by an amateur, a Columbia Student, Jerry Newman (né Jerome Robert Newman; 1918–1970), and released in the 1973.  Newman's collection was the initial sole material used to launch the jazz label, Onyx Recording, Inc. (aka Onyx Records), a New York entity co-founded in 1972 by Don Schlitten and Joe Fields.
Newman, while a student at Columbia in 1941, lugged his acetate disc recording machine – a portable Wilcox-Gay Recordio "disc cutter" – to jazz clubs in Harlem, including Minton's Playhouse on 118th Street and Clark Monroe's Uptown House on 134th Street, both of which were incubators of jazz of the day, and in 1941, the beginning of bebop.  Newman's collection served as the core library for Onyx Recording, Inc.  Art Tatum at Minton's in 1941, issued by Onyx after being declined by Columbia, on the LP God Is in the House. At the 16th Annual Grammy Awards held in March 1974, the album won two Grammys, one for Best Improvised Jazz Solo and one for Best Liner Notes, written by Morgenstern.  Newman's recordings have been issued as unauthorized records, variously over the years; that is, none were done so with the permission or participation of the artists or their estates. The commercial value of the recordings were deemed nil; and those who acquired and distributed the recordings viewed the mission as one of curating jazz history.
The Art Tatum session at Gee-Haw Stables, later, became the subject of a poem, "Art Tatum at the Gee-Haw Stables," by Grace Schulman.
