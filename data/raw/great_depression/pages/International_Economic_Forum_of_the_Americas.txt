== Mission ==
The International Economic Forum of the Americas was founded to facilitate agreements, offer business opportunities and provide access to unique insights from leading experts and specialists.
The Forum has grown to become a landmark organization bringing together more than 10,000 delegates and over 6000 speakers combined under the auspices of four annual conferences: the Conference of Montreal, the Toronto Global Forum, the World Strategic Forum and the Conference of Paris.


== History ==
The International Economic Forum of the Americas was founded in 1995, when Gil Rémillard, a former Minister of Justice of Quebec, held an inaugural Conference of Montreal, on June 20–22, 1995.
At the time, the globalization of the economies was beginning to emerge at an increased rate. With the end of the Cold War, the success of the "Uruguay round" in 1989, the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994 and the beginnings of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the world was ready to construct a global market that would benefit of every countries. A desire emerged to create an independent international forum in Montreal, to identify and understand the impact of all these developments on the global economic system.
The IEFA now hosts four annual events: the Conference of Montreal, the Toronto Global Forum, the World Strategic Forum, held in Miami and The Conference of Paris. These conferences and forums have welcomed past and present politicians, heads of states, corporate executives, central bankers and global economic decision makers.
