Briny Breezes is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The town is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. Briny Breezes (or "Briny" as it is known locally) is a small coastal community of approximately 488 mobile homes along State Road A1A. Briny is a private community consisting mostly of "snowbirds" from the Northeastern, the Midwest, and Canada. It and Ocean Breeze are the only two mobile home parks in Florida that are incorporated towns. The population was 502 at the 2020 US census.


== History ==
In 1919, the land housed a dairy farm owned by Michigan lumberman Ward Miller, then known as Shore Acres Dairy. Around the time of the Great Depression, he allowed tourists, who brought their trailers down from the North, to camp on his land. He began advertising the land by placing flyers in Northern newspapers, such as the Chicago Tribune, that touted Briny's "$3 a week rent." In 1958, Miller wanted to retire and made an offer to the campers to buy the land: $2,000 per lot and $2,500 for those near the water. The campers brought their assets together and the Town of Briny Breezes was incorporated on March 19, 1963, complete with its own mayor and post office.
The town's first mayor was Hugh David. He held office until his death in 1997, and was never opposed in an election. His successor, Robert Conkey, also died in office only months into his second term in 2000. Conkey's second term was notable as he won the election by only five votes.
In its beginnings, the town was mainly made up of families that came to live during the winter. Now, the residents are senior citizens that live there either year round or just in the winter.
Parts of the 1992 comedy-drama movie Folks!, starring Tom Selleck and Don Ameche, were filmed in Briny Breezes. The town was used as the setting for the 2005 film In Her Shoes, and many of its residents served as extras in the movie.


=== Development ===
In October 2005, developer Jean Francois Roy, of Ocean Land Investments, made an offer to buy the entire town for $500 million. This would equate to an average of slightly more than $1 million per residential lot. In December 2005, it was announced that 73 percent of the 488 lot owners had voted to hire a lawyer to pursue the sale. Later, Roy raised his offer to $510 million.
Had the sale gone through, it would have meant a huge windfall for each lot owner. Many people paid between $30,000 and $40,000 when they purchased their homes.  In comparison, the 2000 census reported $129,000 was the median value of a home in Briny.
A vote to ratify the deal was set for January 10, 2007, and 80 percent of residents approved of the sale, with 97 percent of owners voting. The residents would not receive any compensation until 2009 and the plan was yet to be approved by state and local officials, due to zoning concerns.
However, on July 30, 2007, when the "earnest money" was due to the town, the deal was cancelled by the land developer over a dispute with the town board of directors over how long a period was to be allowed for due diligence.
