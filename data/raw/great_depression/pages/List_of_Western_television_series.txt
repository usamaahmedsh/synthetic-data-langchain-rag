Television Westerns are programs with settings in the later half of the 19th century in the American Old West, Western Canada, and Mexico, during the period from about 1860 to the end of the so-called "Indian Wars". More recent entries in the Western genre have used the neo-Western subgenre, placing events in the modern day, or the space Western subgenre, but still draw inspiration from the outlaw attitudes prevalent in traditional Western productions.
When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite, with 30 such shows airing at prime time by 1959. Traditional Westerns faded in popularity in the late 1960s, while new shows fused Western elements with other types of shows, such as family drama, mystery thrillers, and crime drama. In the 1990s and 2000s, slickly packaged, made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced.
