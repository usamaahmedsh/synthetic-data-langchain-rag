=== Early history ===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans.  From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America.  In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.


=== 19th century ===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1886, Morton County was established, which included the land for modern day Rolla.


=== 20th century ===
The first post office at Rolla was established in 1907.  Rolla was laid out in 1913. Rolla is named after Rollie Ray Williamson, who came to Western Kansas in 1907 in a covered wagon with his mother and uncle to meet his father, who had homesteaded in the area.
In the 1930s, the prosperity of the area was severely affected by its location within the Dust Bowl.  This catastrophe intensified the economic impact of the Great Depression in the region.
