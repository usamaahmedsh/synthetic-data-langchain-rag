Brinkley is the most populous city in Monroe County, Arkansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 2,700, down from 3,188 in 2010.
Located within the Arkansas Delta, Brinkley was founded as a railroad town in 1872. The city has historically been a transportation and agricultural center in the region, more recently developing a reputation for outdoors recreation and the ivory-billed woodpecker. Birding has become important to the city and region following the purported discovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker in 2004, a species thought to be extinct 60 years earlier.
Located halfway between Little Rock and Memphis, the city has used the slogan "We'll Meet You Half-Way" in some of its advertising campaigns.


== History ==
In 1852, a land grant for the construction of rail lines was given to the Little Rock and Memphis Railroad Company, led by its president Robert Campbell Brinkley. Born in North Carolina, Brinkley lived in Memphis, where he served a public career of "noble deeds and generous conduct" and for many years served as president of Planters Bank.

Between 1852 and 1869, the settlement was called "Lick Skillet". When the day's work was completed, the railroad construction crew, mostly all immigrants from neighboring towns, cooked their supper over an open fire and returned to their homes when the last "skillet was licked".
The construction of the rail lines between Little Rock and Memphis brought the city of Brinkley into being. Brinkley is situated in the northern part of Monroe County, the halfway point between the two larger cities. It was laid out in the winter of 1869 on lands belonging to the railroad.
A petition request was granted to incorporate Brinkley on August 6, 1872, at which time the town had 50 qualified voters. The original charter was filed with the Arkansas Secretary of State on August 21, 1872. The Cotton Plant Railroad (later called the Batesville and Brinkley Railroad and the White and Black River Valley Railway) originated from the town in 1879, and the Texas and St. Louis Railway was built through Brinkley in 1883.  The Brinkley, Helena and Indian Bay Railway connected to town in about 1889, the line later becoming the Arkansas Midland Railroad and subsequently the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway in 1910.
On March 8, 1909, much of the town was destroyed by a violent F4 tornado, which resulted in 49 deaths. Entire families were lost to the tornado, and approximately 800 buildings in the community were destroyed. The tornado was 2/3 of a mile wide.
Duck hunting is a major source of income for the city during the months of November, December and January. With many rice fields flooded for the winter, and being located on the Mississippi Flyway, ducks are very prevalent throughout the region. Men and women from around the United States come to Brinkley for guided hunts throughout the season.

=== Tourism ===

Brinkley is located 10 miles (16 km) east of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge, where in February 2004 the ivory-billed woodpecker was purportedly rediscovered after having thought to be extinct for over 60 years. Brinkley has attempted to capitalize on its good fortune of being the largest city near the refuge and the rediscovery of the woodpecker.
In addition to the ivory-billed sightings, since July 2005 at least two confirmed reports of bald eagle nests have been found in the Monroe County area. Further, the swamps of the Cache River are believed to contain among the oldest cypress trees in the United States.
Brinkley opened a convention center in 1996 which can seat up to 600 people; in February 2006 the center hosted a conference commemorating the second anniversary of the ivory-billed woodpecker's rediscovery.
