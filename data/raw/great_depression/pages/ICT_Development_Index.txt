The ICT Development Index (IDI) is an index published by the United Nations International Telecommunication Union based on internationally agreed information and communication technologies (ICT) indicators. This makes it a valuable tool for benchmarking the most important indicators for measuring the information society. The IDI is a standard tool that governments, operators, development agencies, researchers and others can use to measure the digital divide and compare ICT performance within and across countries. 
Having the role to analyze the level of development of the information and communication technology sector (ICT), the ICT Development Index (IDI) is a composite indicator published by ITU between 2009 and 2017. It was discontinued in 2018, owing to issues of data availability and quality. In October 2022, ITU’s Plenipotentiary Conference 2022 in Bucharest adopted a revised text of Resolution 131, which defines, inter alia, the main features of the process for developing and adopting a new IDI methodology and of the IDI itself. In November 2023, the revised IDI methodology was approved by the Member States and is valid for four years. In December 2023, the 2023 edition of the IDI based on the new methodology was released. The 2024 edition of the IDI was released in June 2024.
