== History ==
The borough was named in 1889 for Cornelius Campbell, the first superintendent of the Glenwood Coal Company (glen is the Scottish word for valley), which mined in that area. Glen Campbell became a borough on September 27, 1894. ″The petition for Glen Campbell to become a borough is dated March 5, 1894. The papers were presented to the grand jury and after hearing the parties, and a full investigation of the matter, it was found that the law, under Act of Assembly, had been complied with and the prayer of the petitioners was granted. It was authorized that the election be held annually, the third Tuesday of February, as provided by the constitution. The court decreed further that the first election be held October 13, 1894, at the wareroom of B. B. Kime, in the said borough, between the hours of eight o'clock A. M. and seven o'clock P. M., and designated S. J. Smith to give due notice of said election. The court appointed Andrew Patrick judge and William Lewis and D. I. Stadden inspectors.″
Popular singer Glen Campbell visited Glen Campbell in 1971. The distinguished academic Glenn Campbell did also at some point.
Michael William Menosky, a professional baseball player, also known as "Leaping Mike" for his speed and circus-like catches in the outfield, was born in Glen Campbell on October 16, 1894. At some point, the family moved about four miles away to Arcadia. Leaping Mike went on to play baseball from 1914 to 1930. He played for the Pittsburgh Rebels, Washington Senators, and the Boston Red Sox. He replaced Babe Ruth in left field after Babe Ruth was sold to the New York Yankees, beginning what was referred to as "the curse" in Boston.
Glen Campbell, the first coal town in Indiana County, was founded in 1889. It was named for  Cornelius Campbell, the first superintendent of the Glenwood Coal Company, the enterprise which initiated mining operations in the area. The town experienced immediate growth and soon a number of coal companies were operating in and around the community. The Hillsdale Coal & Coke Company was formed in 1902 by H. E. Clark, J. D. Ake, S. H. Hicks and J. O. Clark. In 1905, The Clark Brothers Coal Mining Company was established by H. E. Clark, J. O. Clark and S. L. Clark.
In 1894, just five years after its inception, Glen Campbell was incorporated as a borough. The town quickly became the service, business, and shopping center for a number of smaller mining communities that sprang up in northern Indiana County.
By 1900 Glen Campbell was the third largest town in Indiana County. It also had the distinction of being the county's fastest-growing community. In fact, residents of the community felt it was plausible that the county seat would someday be moved to Glen Campbell.
The town was serviced by both the Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads. In addition to coal mining, there were a number of lumber mills. In 1905 the Giant Electric Light, Heat, and Power Company opened operations in Glen Campbell. The company provided electricity to communities in northern Indiana and southern Clearfield counties.
Other industries included a brickyard which was established on the Cush Creek, a stream that flows through the community, and a cooper's shop which manufactured barrels. Later a battery factory was opened. There also were plans for the construction of a foundry and a furniture factory.
At its height of prosperity, the town had approximately sixty businesses. There was an opera house and a nickelodeon. The community boasted its own school system, which included a high school. There were a number of dentists and doctors. One doctor even operated an infirmary for the miners.

The borough had its own bank, the First National Bank of Glen Campbell. A number of newspapers were published in the town for instance, The Glen Campbell Comet, H. E. Williams, Publisher, and many social organizations sprang up.
Unfortunately, the bubble burst. Labor unrest, the decline in coal output, the depletion of timber stocks, and a number of disastrous fires left Glen Campbell in serious financial condition. The Great Depression dealt the town its final blow. The bank closed permanently, and a number of businesses either folded or moved elsewhere. The community never recovered.
Although its heyday has long since passed, the town still has the capability of attracting fame. It received national attention in 1971 when Glen Campbell, the country music singer, made a surprise visit. The trip was featured in a TV Guide article later that year.
Although no longer the size it once was, Glen Campbell continues to function in its own right. The town's fire company provides fire protection to a number of communities in the area. Its three churches (Methodist, Baptist, and Roman Catholic) all have active congregations. Social organizations include the American Legion and the Glen Campbell Fireman's Auxiliary. The town's post office still provides rural services to a large area surrounding the borough. There are a number of businesses, including some which are coal related, that call Glen Campbell home.

The Sen. Joseph O. Clark House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. This house is located in the area referred to by locals as "Candy Bank" or 247 First Avenue. Joseph O. Clark was a state senator from 1921 to 1924 for the 37th district. He was a Republican. He was "Born in Montgomery Township, Indiana County, September 7, 1871, the son of John W. and Adah S. (Hiddlesen) Clark; educated in public schools; Dickinson Seminary (Williamsport); Germantown Academy; Eastman Business College, Poughkeepsie; partner in lumber business at Glen Campbell, Pa.; organizer and board member, First National Bank, Glen Campbell; elected president of same, 1905; investor and director of numerous coal, oil, water, glass, and electric companies throughout the United States; president of Royal Oil and Gas Co., 1936; elected to state Senate, 1921-1924; died July 21, 1936.″'
