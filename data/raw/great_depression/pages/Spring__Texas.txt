Spring is a census-designated place (CDP) within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Houston in Harris County, Texas, United States, part of the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area. The population was 62,559 at the 2020 census. While the name "Spring" is popularly applied to a large area of northern Harris County and a smaller area of southern Montgomery County, the original town of Spring, now known as Old Town Spring, is at the intersection of Spring-Cypress and Hardy roads and encompasses perhaps 1 square kilometer (0.39 sq mi).


== History ==
The large geographic area now known as Spring was originally inhabited by the Orcoquiza Native Americans. In 1836, the Texas General Council of the Provisional Government placed what is now the town of Spring in the Harrisburg municipality. In 1838, William Pierpont placed a trading post on Spring Creek. In 1840, the town of Spring had 153 residents. By the mid-1840s, many German immigrants, including Gus Bayer and Carl Wunsche, moved to the area and began farming. People from Louisiana and other parts of the post-Civil War Southern U.S. settled in Spring. The main cash crops in Spring were sugar cane and cotton; residents also grew vegetables.
The International and Great Northern Railroad, built through Spring, opened in 1871 and caused Spring to expand. In 1873, Spring received a post office. By 1884, Spring had 150 residents, two steam saw and grist mills, two cotton gins, three churches, and several schools. In 1901–1903, the International-Great Northern Railroad opened, connecting Spring to Fort Worth. Spring, now with a roundhouse, became a switchyard with 200 rail workers and 14 track yards. The population increased to 1,200 by 1910. After the roundhouse relocated to Houston in 1923, Spring's population declined; by 1931, it was 300. The Spring State Bank opened in 1912. It was robbed several times in the 1930s; there was a false rumor that one of the robberies was committed by Bonnie and Clyde. The bank consolidated with Tomball Bank in 1935.
By 1947, Spring had 700 residents. In the 1970s, Houston's suburbs began to expand northward, and more subdivisions and residential areas opened in the Spring area. Some older houses in the town of Spring were restored and housed shops. The Old Town Spring Association opened in 1980 to promote the Old Town Spring shopping area, which consists of the restored houses. In 1984, the Spring area had 15,000 residents. By 1989, Old Town Spring became a tourist area. In 1990, the Spring area had 33,111 residents.
From 1969 to 1992, the Goodyear airship America was based in Spring from its large hangar visible just off Interstate 45. Takeoffs and landings were a major attraction and motorists continually pulled off to the interstate's shoulders to watch. In 1992 the America was moved to Akron, Ohio, and the massive hangar was eventually torn down. As of 2020, the hangar's concrete foundation is still visible at the intersection of Holzwarth Road and Meadow Edge Lane west of Lowe's Home Improvement Center.
The 1992 Log Cabin Republicans convention was held in Spring.

===== History of public schools =====
Originally Spring was served by the Spring Common School District. In 1935 that district and the Harrell Common School District merged, forming the Spring Independent School District. The Southwell School, the segregated African-American school, served Spring from the early 1900s until 1945. In 1932 the Wunsche family donated land to the Spring school district, and the Carl Wunsche School, serving middle and high school, opened. In 1947 an addition opened and elementary school students began to be served by Wunsche. Salyers, opened in 1959 as Spring Elementary School, was Spring ISD's first dedicated elementary school. After Salyers opened, elementary school classes were removed from Wunsche School. Spring High School opened in 1969, taking high school students from Wunsche. As a result, Wunsche became SISD's first dedicated middle school.
Winship Elementary School's classes began in 1972; the Winship campus opened on December 15 of that year. Jenkins opened on February 6, 1977. Hirsch opened in 1978. Anderson opened in 1979. Dueitt opened in 1980. Wunsche closed as a regular middle school in 1983, and was retrofitted to become a multipurpose school. Twin Creeks, which took Wumsche's middle school population, opened in 1984. Smith opened in 1986. Anderson was named a 1989–90 National Blue Ribbon School. Burchett opened in August 2005. Bailey opened in August 2006 and was dedicated on October 15 of that year. By 2015, Spring ISD planned to have built a new elementary school and High School #4 within the Spring CDP. Middle School #8 (Springwoods Village) is scheduled to open in fall 2020.

===== Northwoods Catholic School =====
Northwoods Catholic School, a private Catholic school in the Spring area, was off the intersection of Farm to Market Road 2920 and Gosling Road, in a 51-acre (21 ha) campus. It used a curriculum from the Legionaries of Christ. Established c. 1999, it was not affiliated with the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. It initially had 13 students, and was in a facility in the Ponderosa Forest neighborhood, an apartment clubhouse temporarily used as a school.
In 2003 it had 200 students. By that year its permanent facility opened; it had a price tag of $6 million. In 2004 it had 250 students. In 2005 academic dean Susan Horne became the principal, and the previous principal, Joe Noonan, became Northwood's executive director. In 2010 it had about 230 students, with about 40% of them originating from The Woodlands. The building's first floor had 44,000 square feet (4,100 m2) of space. Its 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) second floor, with offices, computer and science labs, and a library, was blessed on August 13, 2010, and opened on August 18. It was built in three months.
In the 2015–16 school year, the school's final year of operation, it had 268 students; it was projected to have 160 for the following year. The school announced on May 4, 2016, that it was closing because of a shrinking budget and declining enrollment. It closed on June 30, 2016. An area developer who was buying land from the school got into a legal dispute with the landowner and a Catholic priest.


=== Community colleges ===
Lone Star College System (formerly the North Harris Montgomery Community College District) serves Spring ISD, Klein ISD, and Conroe ISD, and therefore the entire Spring area. Areas in Cy-Fair ISD (and therefore Lakes on Eldridge) are in Lone Star College. Spring ISD residents and two other K–12 school districts voted to create North Harris County College. The community college district began operations in 1973.


=== Public libraries ===
Harris County Public Library (HCPL) operates several library branches.
HCPL operates the Baldwin Boettcher Branch Library at Mercer Park at 22248 Aldine Westfield Road, south of the Spring CDP. The 10,137-square-foot (941.8 m2) branch opened in 1986. It was constructed on donated land. It was named after Baldwin Boettcher, a German settler. His descendants deeded the homestead to Harris County. The plans stated that the Boettcher staff would assist the Mercer Park staff in finding any botanical reference books that they or the public need.
The Barbara Bush Branch Library at Cypress Creek is at 6817 Cypresswood Drive in an area with a Spring address west of the Spring CDP. The 32,000-square-foot (3,000 m2) branch opened in 1976 and was upgraded and expanded in 2002. Construction of the current library began in the summer of 2000. The current branch was anticipated to house over 120,000 books and materials, making it twice as large as the previous branch. Jesse Sendejas of the Houston Chronicle said there was "a need to provide a more spacious and accommodating facility to Spring and its surrounding areas. That was apparent when county voters approved a $15 million bond for library improvements in November 1997."


== Parks and recreation ==

Harris County Precinct 4 operates parks in the Spring CDP. Southwell Park, a 5-acre (2.0 ha) facility located at 27419 Nelson Street, includes the B.F.

=== Old Town Spring ===
Old Town Spring is an old town with over 150 shops, restaurants, and art galleries in Spring, a community in unincorporated Harris County, Texas.
Old Town Spring is north of Houston and outside Beltway 8. Many of the original buildings, some over 100 years old, now house places to buy antiques, collectibles, clothing, and gifts.

After the Depression, Prohibition, and a relocation of the railroad headquarters, the town slowly declined in population until Houston's oil boom in the 1970s and 1980s brought merchants back to the area.
