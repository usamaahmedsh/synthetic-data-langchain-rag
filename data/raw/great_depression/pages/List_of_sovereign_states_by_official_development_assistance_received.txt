This is a list of countries based on the official development assistance (ODA) they have received for the given year. More comprehensive and current lists are available from the OECD (Table DAC2a) and the World Bank (Net official development assistance and official aid received (current US$)).
The figures shown are based on OECD measures and definitions of international aid. Amounts are in "current U.S. dollars", i.e. amounts paid at the time, not adjusted for later or earlier inflation or currency movements.
Countries like Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United States, which send assistance to other developing countries, as well as least developed, poor or low-income countries, do not receive the assistance. Developing countries like Algeria, Egypt, India, Malaysia, Morocco, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey, which receive assistance from developed countries, sometimes send the assistance. Other developing countries, like Iran and Pakistan, both of which receive assistance from developed countries, rarely send the assistance.
