== History ==
In 1909, Michio Suzuki (1887–1982) founded the Suzuki Loom Works in the small seacoast village of Hamamatsu, Japan. Business boomed as Suzuki built weaving looms for Japan's giant silk industry. In 1929, Michio Suzuki invented a new type of weaving machine, which was exported overseas. The company's first 30 years focused on the development and production of these machines.
Despite the success of his looms, Suzuki believed that his company would benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products. Based on consumer demand, he decided that building a small car would be the most practical new venture. The project began in 1937, and within two years Suzuki had completed several compact prototype cars. These first Suzuki motor vehicles were powered by a then-innovative, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. It had a cast aluminium crankcase and gearbox and generated 13 horsepower (9.7 kW) from a displacement of less than 800 cc.
With the onset of World War II, production plans for Suzuki's new vehicles were halted when the government declared civilian passenger cars a "non-essential commodity." At the conclusion of the war, Suzuki went back to producing looms. Loom production was given a boost when the U.S. government approved the shipping of cotton to Japan. Suzuki's fortunes brightened as orders began to increase from domestic textile manufacturers. But the joy was short-lived as the cotton market collapsed in 1951.
Faced with this colossal challenge, Suzuki returned to the production of motor vehicles. After the war, the Japanese had a great need for affordable, reliable personal transportation. A number of firms began offering "clip-on" petrol-powered engines that could be attached to the typical bicycle. Suzuki's first two-wheeled vehicle was a bicycle fitted with a motor called, the "Power Free." Designed to be inexpensive and simple to build and maintain, the 1952 Power Free had a 36 cc, one horsepower, two-stroke engine. The new double-sprocket gear system enabled the rider to either pedal with the engine assisting, pedal without engine assist, or simply disconnect the pedals and run on engine power alone. The patent office of the new democratic government granted Suzuki a financial subsidy to continue research in motorcycle engineering.

By 1954, Suzuki was producing 6,000 motorcycles per month and his company had officially changed its name to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. Following the success of his first motorcycles, Suzuki created an even more successful automobile: the 1955 Suzuki Suzulight. The Suzulight sold with front-wheel drive, four-wheel independent suspension and rack-and-pinion steering, which were not common on cars until three decades later.
From 1981 to 1982, Suzuki played a prominent role in setting up the first largely foreign owned car company in India, Maruti Suzuki. Though originally majority-owned by the Indian government, Suzuki, which initially owned 26%, would obtain more shares of Maruti Suzuki in 2003, and later acquire the majority of the India-based subsidiary in 2007.
Volkswagen held a 19.9% non-controlling shareholding in Suzuki between 2009 and 2015. This situation did not last, as Suzuki accused Volkswagen of not sharing promised technology while Volkswagen objected to a deal where Suzuki purchased diesel engines from Fiat. An international arbitration court ordered Volkswagen to sell the stake back to Suzuki. Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete the stock buy-back in September 2015.
In November 2012, low sales forced Suzuki to closes its branches in the United States.


=== Leadership ===
The company was founded by Michio Suzuki. In 1978, the company would be taken over by Osamu Suzuki, the fourth adopted son-in-law in a row to run the company, Osamu Suzuki, the 91 year old Chairman of Suzuki Motor Corporation, retired in June 2021, handing over to his son Toshihiro; Osamu Suzuki, who is credited with building the company into its current status and who also still stayed on as an advisor following his retirement as chairman, died in December 2024.

=== Timeline ===

The Suzuki Loom Company started in 1909 as a manufacturer of looms for weaving silk and cotton. Michio Suzuki was intent on making better, more user-friendly looms and, for 30 years his focus was on the development of these machines. Michio's desire to diversify into automotive products was interrupted by World War II. Before it began building four-stroke engines, Suzuki Motor Corp. was known for its two-stroke engines (for motorcycles and autos). After the war, Suzuki made a two-stroke motorized bicycle, but eventually the company would be known for Hayabusa and GSX-R motorcycles, for the QuadRunner, and for dominating racetracks around the world. Even after producing its first car in 1955 the company didn't have an automobile division until 1961. Today Suzuki is among the world's largest automakers, and a major brand name in important markets, including Japan and India, but no longer sells cars in Canada and the United States.

In 2000, Maruti Alto was launched. The Maruti models include Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, launched in 2003, Maruti Versa, launched in 2004, Maruti Suzuki Swift, launched in 2005, Maruti Zen Estilo and Maruti Suzuki SX4, launched in 2007.
On 14 February 2011, Maruti announced that it had achieved one million total accumulated production volume of the Alto. The Alto has reached the million units mark in just seven years and five months since its launch in September 2000. The last half of the million was achieved in 25 months. The Alto became the third car by Maruti Suzuki stable to cross the million units mark, following the Maruti 800 and the Omni.
In January 2012 at the New Delhi Auto Expo, Maruti presented a new car called the Maruti Suzuki XA Alpha, to commence production in mid-late 2013. Maruti Suzuki unveiled the Vitara Brezza in the Indian Auto Expo 2016 as a contender in the subcompact SUV segment.
Maruti Exports Limited is Maruti's exporting subsidiary and, as such, does not operate in the domestic Indian market except in its capacity as an exporter for Maruti Suzuki and for the international Suzuki Motor Corporation as well as their other affiliates. The first commercial consignment of 480 cars were sent to Hungary. By sending a consignment of 571 cars to the same country, Maruti crossed the benchmark of 3,000,000 cars. Since its inception export was one of the aspects the government has been keen to encourage.


=== American Suzuki Motor Corp. ===
American Suzuki headquarters was in Brea, California. The company announced in November 2012 that it would stop selling cars in the United States.
Through an agreement with General Motors, Suzuki began selling a version of their Suzuki Cultus in the United States as the Chevrolet Sprint in 1985. This model was initially sold as a 3-door hatchback and would be Chevrolet's smallest model.

The Samurai was also introduced in 1985 for the 1986 model year and was the first car introduced to the United States by the newly created American Suzuki Corp. No other Japanese company sold more cars in the United States in its first year than Suzuki. The Samurai was available as a convertible or hardtop and the company slogan was Never a Dull Moment. The Samurai was successful until Consumer Reports alleged the Samurai of being susceptible to roll over in a 1988 test. This led to a much publicized 1996 lawsuit, not settled until 2004.
In 1989, American Suzuki introduced the Swift which was the 2nd generation Suzuki Cultus. The Swift was available as a GTi and GLX hatchback with a 4-door sedan following in 1990. A new small SUV called the Sidekick was also introduced in 1989. 1991 saw the introduction of the 4-door Suzuki Sidekick, the first 4-door mini-SUV in North America. The Swift and Sidekick were cousins to GM's Geo Metro and Geo Tracker and were mostly produced in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada by Suzuki and GM's joint venture, CAMI. The Swift GT/GTi and 4-door models were imported from Japan. Negative evaluations from Consumer Reports of the Suzuki Samurai led to some temporary setbacks at American Suzuki as annual sales in the following years dropped to below 20,000 units.
In 1995, American Suzuki introduced the Esteem and redesigned the Swift. The Swift GT was dropped and this version Swift was specific only to North America where it was built at CAMI. These models were the first Suzuki vehicles to be marketed in North America with dual front airbags. A station wagon version of the Esteem was introduced in 1996. Worldwide Suzuki production reached more than 975,000 cars this year.
Also in 1996, American Suzuki released the 2-door SUV X-90 and a revised Sidekick Sport model with dual airbags, a 95 hp (71 kW) 1.6 litre engine, 15 inch wheels. The Sidekick was replaced by the Vitara and the Grand Vitara for 1999. The Grand Vitara would be Suzuki's first model with a V6-cylinder engine and available 4-wheel ABS brakes.
The XL-7 was introduced in 1998 as a stretched version of the Grand Vitara. The XL-7 had a larger 2.7-litre V6-cylinder engine and 3-row seating. This would be Suzuki's largest vehicle to date.
The Swift was dropped from the model lineup in 2001 and the Esteem was replaced in 2002 by the new Aerio, which was offered as a 4-door sedan and 5-door crossover with 4-wheel drive as an option.
In 2004, General Motors and Suzuki jointly purchased the bankrupt Daewoo Motors renaming the venture GMDAT. American Suzuki rebadged the compact Daewoo Nubira/Daewoo Lacetti as the Forenza and the mid-size Daewoo Magnus as the Verona. The Forenza gained station wagon and hatchback body style in 2005, with the hatchback sold under the Reno name.
2006 was the first year American Suzuki sold more than 100,000 vehicles in the United States. Suzuki redesigned the Grand Vitara in 2006 as well as introduced the all-new SX4 and XL7 in 2007. The Suzuki SX4 is produced as a joint venture with Fiat and the XL7 (notice the shortening of the name from Grand Vitara XL-7) was produced as a joint venture with GM at CAMI Automotive Inc. in Ingersoll. Suzuki put XL7 production on indefinite hiatus in mid-2009 due to low demand and subsequently sold off its share of CAMI back to GM later that year.
Despite a difficult domestic US automarket, Suzuki kept pace with its 2007 sales numbers in 2008. In 2009 however, Suzuki sales dropped 48.5%, following a 17% sales drop in 2008. Suzuki did not import any 2010 model year street motorcycles into the US, with dealers instead relying on unsold stock from the 2009 model year. New street motorcycle models to the US resumed for the 2011 model year.
In November 2012, Suzuki announced that its US division would file for bankruptcy and would stop selling automobiles in the United States. It plans to continue to sell motorcycles, ATVs, and marine products in the US. In ten months of 2012, Suzuki sold only 21,188 automobiles in the US. The combination of a strong yen and Suzuki's own limited offering of models has been blamed for the downturn.


=== Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited ===

Following the terms of the joint-venture agreement between Suzuki Motor Corporation of Japan (SMC) and Pakistan Automobile Corporation (PACO), Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL) was incorporated as a public limited company in August 1983.
The new company assumed the assets including production facilities of Awami Autos Limited. PSMCL started commercial operations in January 1984 with the primary objective of passenger cars, pick ups, vans and 4x4 vehicles.
The groundbreaking ceremony of the company's green field automobile plant at Bin Qasim was performed by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan in early 1989.
On completion of first phase of this plant in early 1990, in-house assembly Suzuki engines started. The new plant was completed in 1992, and Suzuki production was transferred to new plant – and three-box 1,300 cc Margalla car was also added to its range of production.
In September 1992 the company was privatized and placed directly under the Japanese Management. At the time of privatization SMC increased its equity from 25% to 40% Subsequently, SMC progressively increased its equity to 73.09% by 31 December 2001.
The Bin Qasim Plant further expanded its production capacity to 50,000 vehicles per year in July 1994 and 300,000 vehicles had been manufactured at this plant by December 2003.

in 1989, Heron Suzuki GB Limited became Heron Suzuki Plc.
In 1994, Suzuki GB PLC took over the direct distribution of all Suzuki products in the United Kingdom.


=== Suzuki Indomobil Motor ===

PT Suzuki Indomobil Motor (formerly PT Indomobil Suzuki International until December 2008) is a joint venture between Suzuki Motor Corporation and the Indomobil Group. The company is located in Jakarta, Indonesia and specialized in manufacturing Suzuki vehicles for the domestic and international markets. A separate company, PT Suzuki Indomobil Sales (SIS), previously PT Indomobil Niaga International, handled sales and marketing of Suzuki automobiles and motorcycles.
Suzuki has done its first activities on the Indonesian market in 1970 about its import firm PT. Indohero Steel & Engineering Company. Six years later they were built the manufacturing facility in Jakarta which is the oldest part of the Indomobil Group.
Their first product was the ST20 Carry (introduced in 1978), it saw extensive use as an Angkot. Nicknamed "Trungtung", it was built until at least 1983. This is an onomatopoetic word for the sound made by the Carry's two-stroke engine.
In 2011, the company invested $800 million for producing Low Cost Green Car (LCGC) in Indonesia. In 2013, Suzuki opened another plant in Cikarang with a total investment of $1 billion. The plant manufactured Ertiga MPV for both domestic and export markets and K10B engine for Karimun Wagon R.


=== Suzuki Motorcycle India, Private Limited ===

Suzuki Motorcycle India, Private Limited (SMIL) is the wholly owned Indian subsidiary of Suzuki, Japan. The company has a manufacturing plant at Gurgaon, Haryana having the annual capacity of 5,40,000 units.

=== Concept automobiles ===

GSX-R/4 concept car was presented in 2001. It is fitted with a 1,300 cm3 (79 cu in) engine taken from the GSX1300R Hayabusa motorcycle in an attempt to split the difference, merging the posture of an automobile and the disposition of a sportbike (Suzuki had been particularly successful selling motorcycles in the United States). Its high-revving inline-four engine supplied about 175 hp to a bare-bones, two-seat roadster weighing less than 1500 pounds.
Pixy + SSC concept was introduced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The Pixy is an enclosed three-wheel, single-seat personal transport pod, similar to the Toyota i-unit, and i-REAL, but dissimilar in that two Pixies can dock inside the SSC (aka Suzuki Sharing Coach) for highway driving. Electric power is generated by a hydrogen fuel cell and solar panels to drive the SSC carrier van, and to recharge the Pixy at the same time.
Hayabusa Sport was a sports car unveiled at the 2002 Tokyo Auto Salon. Its engine - the same 1.3l I4 as found in the GSXR/4 and the GSXR-1300R Hayabusa sports bike it was named after - would produce 175 hp at 9800rpm and was mated to a 6-speed sequential gearbox. Due to characteristics such as its front-mid engine positioning and diminutive carbon-fibre body, Suzuki achieved an optimal front:rear weight distribution of 50:50 and a markedly low mass of 550 kg. One prototype was created and, while conceived as a street-legal car, was not ever used on the road.
X-HEAD is a concept vehicle that debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Auto Show. It has a somewhat unusual design, looking similar to a dump truck. It has an X pattern on its tires, but the X in its name is attributed to its multipurpose capability.
Suzuki Concept X debuted at the 2005 North American International Auto Show as a significant departure in styling for a Suzuki mid-sized sport utility vehicle aimed at younger buyers in the North American market. This concept vehicle evolved into the second-generation XL7 introduced late in 2006.
G70 appeared at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show as the Regina, but was renamed before the 2012 Salon International de l'Auto and Auto China shows to signify that it met the goal of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions no higher than 70g/km (and perhaps that Regina as a model name would be a marketing fiasco). The G70 is a concept for the next-generation global compact car, possibly replacing the Alto, and at 3,550 millimetres (140 in) long and 1,630 mm (64 in) wide with a weight of 730 kilograms (1,610 lb), the G70 is smaller and lighter than the Alto. It has an extremely economical 800 cubic centimetres (49 cu in), direct-injection turbo petrol engine mated to a continuously variable transmission, and a claimed fuel mileage of 3.1 litres per 100 kilometres (91 mpg‑imp; 76 mpg‑US).
Q-concept, first shown at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show, is a bubble car like the MIT CityCar, Nissan Pivo or Toyota PM. Just 2,500 millimetres (98 in) in length, the Q-concept has its driver and one passenger riding in tandem but is more comfortable than a motorcycle, being enclosed and having seats instead of a saddle. Intended primarily for short trips (within 10 kilometres (6.2 mi)) it ought to be able to park in nearly any available space.
Suzuki unveiled the iK-2 concept at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show.
Suzuki showed the 4x4 mini SUV concept iM-4 concept at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015.


== Motorcycles ==
Suzuki started manufacturing motorcycles in 1952, the first models being motorized bicycles. From 1955 to 1976 the company manufactured motorcycles with two-stroke engines only, the biggest two-stroke model being the water-cooled triple-cylinder G2F5.
A large factor in Suzuki's success in two-stroke competition was the East German Grand Prix racer Ernst Degner, who defected to the West in 1961, bringing with him expertise in two-stroke engines from the East German manufacturer MZ. The secrets Degner brought with him were three crucial technologies: the boost port, the expansion chamber, and the rotary valve. Walter Kaaden of MZ was the first engineer to combine these three crucial technologies.
Suzuki hired Degner, and he won the 50 cc class FIM road racing World Championship for them in the 1962 season. Suzuki became the first Japanese manufacturer to win a motocross world championship when Joel Robert won the 1970 250 cc title. In the 1970s, Suzuki established themselves in the motorcycle racing world with Barry Sheene Marco Lucchinelli1981 Franco Uncini1982 winning world championships in the premier 500 cc class.
In 1976 Suzuki introduced its first motorcycles since the Colleda COX of the 1950s with four-stroke engines, the GS400 and GS750.
In 1994, Suzuki partnered with Nanjing Jincheng Machinery to create a Chinese motorcycle manufacturer and exporter called Jincheng Suzuki.
Suzuki continued to compete in MotoGP and last won the title in the 2000 season. From 2006 to 2011, the team was sponsored by Rizla and was known as Rizla Suzuki MotoGP team. On 18 November 2011, Suzuki announced that the GP racing was suspended, partly due to natural disasters and recession, until 2014. Suzuki returned to MotoGP in 2015.
The next few years in MotoGP were rather experimental for Suzuki, with some spotty success; but in 2020, on Suzuki's 100th anniversary, Spanish rider Joan Mir surprised the world by cinching the 2020 MotoGP World Championship, Suzuki's first GP conquest since Kenny Roberts Jr's World Championship win in 2000.
In addition Suzuki have recorded a total of 94 victories at the Isle of Man TT Races. Suzuki have also taken the runner up spot in the various race categories 100 times and a total 92 third places.


=== Models ===

Some notable Suzuki motorcycles include the following:


==== Two-stroke engines ====

X6 Hustler twin (aka T20 Super Six) was sold from 1966 to 1968 as "the fastest 250cc motorcycle in the world". It had Suzuki's new Posi-Force automatic oil injection system (later called Suzuki CCI). Production peaked at more than 5000 units per month. In 2013, Suzuki renewed the Hustler motorcycle trademark for Europe, leading to rumors of a retro style 250 twin. A 1967 T20 Super Six was included in the Las Vegas show of The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition.
T500 Titan (aka T500 Cobra, GT500) had a 500 cc air-cooled parallel-twin engine which overcame problems with durability, overheating and vibration. With an output of 47 metric horsepower (35 kW) at 6,500 rpm and top speed of 180 kilometres per hour (110 mph), it became Suzuki's flagship machine in 1968, and remains popular with collectors and café racers.
GT750 Le Mans with a straight-three engine was the first Japanese motorcycle with a liquid-cooled engine, earning it the moniker "Water Buffalo." The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan (in Japanese) includes the 1971 Suzuki GT750 as one of their 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.
TM400 Cyclone production motocrosser was designed to participate in 500 cc class Motocross World Championship racing. Introduced in 1971, it was notoriously difficult even for skilled riders to control. Redesigned in 1975.
The RM125 production motocrosser debuted in 1975 to replace the TM125. It was a successful forerunner of the future RM series line-up from 50 cc to 500 cc.
RM250 was fully redesigned in 1982 and the liquid-cooled single-cylinder delivered more power than any production 250 cc motorcrosser of the time. It had Suzuki's original full floater, link-type rear suspension introduced a year earlier.
RG250 Gamma of 1983 was one of the new generation of race replica sport bikes of the 1980s. It had an aluminium frame, a full fairing and a high output straight-twin engine. The 1983 RG250Γ is one of the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology.
RG500 Gamma of 1985 was like RG250, but with a square-four engine.
RGV250 Gamma, the road-racing replica of Kevin Schwantz's RGV500 GP race bike, replaced the RG250 in 1988 with a V-twin engine.


==== Four-stroke engines ====

GS series – The 1976 GS750 was the first 4-stroke machine released by Suzuki in 20 years. The following year saw Suzuki's first 1-litre machine, the GS1000E, and then in 1979 the GS1000S copy of a Yoshimura GS1000 Superbike.
Katana – The GSX1100S was released in Europe in 1980; the GSX1000S arrived in the U.S. and Canada later that year as a 1981 model, and revolutionized sportbike styling. A 1982 Katana GS1000SV is on the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame's list of "classic bikes" that have been shown in the museum, and was in The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition.
GSX-R750 was one of the Japanese sport bikes of the 1980s that began the modern race replica era. It had air/oil cooling, light weight, and a powerful engine. The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan (in Japanese) includes the 1984 Suzuki GSX-R750 as one of their 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology, and was in The Art of the Motorcycle.
Intruder 750 with its OHC 4-valve 45° V-twin engine was the first Japanese cruiser motorcycle (designed to appeal to U.S. riders) in 1985. By 1997, cruiser-style motorcycles would account for nearly 60 percent of the U.S. street-bike market.
GSX-R1100, related to the GSX-R750, appeared in 1986. The same basic engine would reappear in 1995 to power the Bandit 1200 and remain in production through 2006.
Suzuki GSF1200 Bandit - Released in 1996 after the fully faired RF900, the big, GSXR-powered Bandit offered stunning performance with real-world ergonomics and capabilities, and has become something of a "cult" model. These units have been used widely from road-race to Open Road Touring, were renowned for their versatility, robustness and massive torque production. Many are still in operation. The carbureted, air (and oil)-cooled design ran from 1996 to 2002; afterward Suzuki moved into fuel injection and liquid cooling on subsequent models. The last of the series was the GSX1250Fa. Though not technically labeled as a "Bandit", it was the last in the long, popular line. Black, with a full-fairing, the GSX/Fa sold for only two years, between 2010 and 2011. Critics praised the model, like the earlier GSF, for its ergonomics and practical, "Do-It-All" capabilities; but market desire sagged due to the final model's heavy weight and relatively low power output.
The DR-BIG aka Desert Express DR800S (in German) off-roader was existent for two model years as the DR750S (in German) until 1990, when its displacement increased to 779 cc, still the world largest single cylinder engine in a production motorcycle. Available in Europe through 1999, it was not exported to the U.S. market. Replaced by the V-Strom twin, the DR-BIG has now come full circle as the design inspiration for a 2014 overhaul of the V-Strom 1000 ABS. As of 2020, the DR-BIG acted as the inspiration of the revisioned Suzuki V-Strom 1050.
Suzuki RF Series The Suzuki RF series are sport touring motorcycles. They came with three engine variations: 400, 600 and 900 cc. It was in production from 1994 to 1998.
TL1000S debuted at the 1996 International Motorcycle and Scooter Show as the first Suzuki sport bike with a V-twin engine. This was a liquid-cooled, 90° V-twin, DOHC engine with 4 valves per cylinder, which would be in production through 2012. Although the TL1000S motorcycle ceased production in 2001, the engine would carry on in the TL1000R, the SV1000 and SV1000S, as well as the V-Strom 1000 and the Suzuki V-Strom 1050.
GSX-R600 – a smaller version of the GSX-R750. There were earlier pretenders, but the genuine article arrived in 1997 and has received frequent updates after that.
Hayabusa (GSX-1300R) was introduced in 1998, and remains Suzuki's flagship sport bike. The 1998 Suzuki Hayabusa is included in the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology. The development of a second generation Hayabusa for the 2008 model year facilitated the 2007 roll-out of the GSX-1300BK B-King, a highly stylized naked variant.
SV650 was introduced in 1999 as a budget entry in the naked bike market, and since 2001, offered both naked and fully faired. In 2009 the naked bike version was redesigned and renamed the Gladius in keeping with the sword motif Suzuki established with the Katana. The Gladius motorcycle won a Good Design Award (aka G Mark) from the Japan Institute of Design Promotion.
GSX-R1000 – This top-of-the-line superbike debuted in 2000, and remains the largest model of the GSX-R series.
Burgman 650 (AN650) was the largest of a series of urban scooters produced in Japan (marketed as Skywave domestically) as well as in Italy and Spain with engine capacities of 125 cc and up. When it appeared in 2002 the 650 was the largest-displacement scooter in the world, and first two-wheel vehicle to have an electrically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission. The Japan Institute of Design Promotion awarded the G Mark Good Design Award to the Skywave 650 in 2003, to the entire Skywave series in 2006 and to the updated Skywave 650LX in 2013.
Choinori was a lightweight, inexpensive, 50 cc scooter and the antithesis of the Skywave 650, but they were introduced at the same time in an effort to increase domestic sales in response to shrinking motorcycle exports. The 2002 Choinori is one of the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology. The Choinori was awarded the G Mark Good Design Award in 2003.
Boulevard M109R (VZR1800) V-twin, dubbed the Intruder M1800R in Europe, arrived in 2006 boasting a 112 mm (4.4 in) bore with a 90.5 mm (3.56 in) stroke, amongst the largest petrol engine pistons ever used in any production motorcycle (or passenger car).
GSX-650F – introduced in 2008, this new sport touring model fills the void of the retired Katana. The 2009 model has ABS standard.
Suzuki DR125 - a 124 cc four stroke motorcycle.
Suzuki DR650(SE) - a legendary 644 cc four stroke dual sport motorcycle.
DL-650 V-Strom – a dual-sport motorcycle
GSX-250F Across – a small 250 cc engine sport touring motorcycle produced from 1990 until 1998. It is mostly known as a practical sports/touring bike, due to its rear petrol tank and a fully enclosed helmet storage area where the petrol tank usually is.
Suzuki GSX-R250 – a motorcycle that was manufactured from 1987 to 1994. A couple of years after the presentation of the GSX-R750 the 250 cc GSX-R250 was released. Like the larger bike, the GSX-R250 had a box-frame (steel, not aluminium), full fairing, full-floater rear swing and a four-cylinder four-stroke engine. But while the GSX-R750 engine was air and oil-cooled, the baby brother had a liquid-cooled engine. Not many examples are seen outside Japan. 17-inch cast wheels and 300 mm twin disc brake at the front. The GSX-R250 had impressive power and was made primarily as a road legal 250 cc racing bike reaching speeds of 200+km/h (124 mph). Imported specimens may be seen in Australia and New Zealand commonly. Also, around 350 units were exported to Denmark around 1989 to 1992. Starting in 2017, the engine continued in the Suzuki V-Strom 250.


==== Other power sources ====

RE5 was the first (and only) Japanese motorcycle produced with a Wankel rotary engine. That, and its Giugiaro styling, make it one of the oddest and most collectible motorcycles of the 1970s. The 1974 RE5 is one of the JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology, and a 1976 model is in the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame.
Burgman Fuel-Cell Scooter uses electric-motor propulsion, powered by an air-cooled hydrogen fuel cell; its only emission is water. Following on a concept model at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, in 2011 the Burgman Fuel-Cell Scooter became the world's first fuel-cell vehicle to earn Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA) in the European Union, enabling the vehicle to be sold in all member states. Suzuki is working toward commercial production of this scooter.


=== Concept motorcycles ===

Falcorustyco concept model at the 1985 Tokyo Motor Show envisaged the motorcycle technologies that might be brought into play by 1995, including a 4-cycle square 4-cylinder 500 cc engine, frameless body, front-and-rear swingarm suspension, center hub hydraulic power steering, chainless hydraulic drive and pop-up screen cowling.
Nuda was a full-time two-wheel drive prototype, incorporating power steering and a swing seat, in a carbon fiber honeycomb monocoque body, shown at the 1986 Tokyo Motor Show. Nuda concepts influenced the design of the Suzuki Hayabusa.
B-King – The concept model was well received by the public when it went on display at the 2001 Tokyo Motor Show. The addition of a turbocharger to the GSX1300R engine testified to massive power output, while electronics such as cellphone and GPS were stowed in the ultra-modern angular bodywork. The production model appeared six years later, largely unchanged except for its naturally aspirated engine. B-King styling is reflected in the award-winning design of the GSR600 and the GSR750, as well as the Inazuma GW250 and GW250S.
G-Strider concept model with 916 cc engine, made public at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, was a half-scooter, half-cruiser (motorcycle) mash-up with an electrically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission incorporating a push-button manual mode, similar to the Burgman 650. Accentuating luxury, the G-Strider's handlebars, footrests, seat backrest, passenger backrest and windscreen were all electrically adjustable while under way to ensure the most comfortable riding position possible.
Stratosphere prototype was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2005, with an 1100 cc engine pushed to the limits of space-saving design, resulting in an in-line six-cylinder as wide as a conventional in-line four-cylinder engine. Hammered aluminium and Damascus steel incorporate material characteristics into styling design. Prospects for a production model seemed good, considering that Suzuki's previous significant concept motorcycle, the B-King had made it into production, but the market changed before Stratosphere got the go-ahead.
Biplane was a blue-sky concept announced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, designed to convey the joy of two-wheel mobility, inspired by the feeling of flying an airplane. Its shape generates a feeling of openness in a modern machine powered by a V-four engine.
Crosscage concept model was displayed at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. Combining a high-performance secondary battery and a compact, lightweight air-cooled fuel-cell system from British specialist company Intelligent Energy enabled quick activation with low fuel consumption. The lithium-ion battery assured reserve power as well as minimal environmental impact. Light weight not only made this bike environment-friendly but also sporty.
Gemma prototype model was introduced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The distinctive "full-flat 2-seater," 250 cc four-stroke single-cylinder scooter is low and sleek and gives the rider and passenger feel a greater sense of intimacy. The luggage compartment in front of the rider holds a helmet. Gemma went into production in Japan the following year for the domestic market.
