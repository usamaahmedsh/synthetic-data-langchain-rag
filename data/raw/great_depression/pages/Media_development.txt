Media development involves capacity building for institutions or individuals related to freedom of expression, pluralism and diversity of media, as well as transparency of media ownership. Media development plays a role in democracy and effective democratic discourse through supporting free and independent media.


== Support ==
International donors and other organizations often include support for media development as part of their overall support to international economic and democratic development. Typical efforts to develop independent media development include: journalist training and education; support for and advice on improving the legal and business environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; media literacy training; digital media training and integration; infrastructure development; monitoring and evaluation efforts, and supporting the transition of state media to public service media with editorial independence.


== Indicators ==


=== UNESCO Media Development Indicators ===
UNESCO developed Media Development Indicators in 2008 as a framework for international media development.
Indicators are within five categories:

A system of regulation conducive to freedom of expression, pluralism and diversity of the media
Plurality and diversity of media, a level economic playing field and transparency of ownership
Media as a platform for democratic discourse
Professional capacity building and supporting institutions that underpins freedom of expression, pluralism and diversity
Infrastructural capacity is sufficient to support independent and pluralistic media
The indicators were used for a pilot international survey in 2011 in which 28 countries participated, focused on regulation and supply.


=== Media Sustainability Index ===
The International Research and Exchanges Board’s (IREX) Media Sustainability Index (MSI) is another widely used tool to evaluate the global development of independent media. The MSI is one of the most important indices "to assess how media systems change over time and across borders."
The MSI uses five fundamental objectives to assess to what extent a media system is independent, sustainable and successful. The five objectives are:

"Legal and social norms protect and promote free speech and access to public information.
Journalism meets professional standards of quality.
Multiple news sources provide citizens with reliable, objective news.
Media are well-managed enterprises, allowing editorial independence.
Supporting institutions function in the professional interests of independent media".


== Media development vs. media for development ==
Some development organizations and experts make a distinction between media development and media for development. Support for "Media development" refers to efforts to directly improve the media in a society (through the means mentioned above). "Media for development" refers to using existing media to convey messages about specific development issues. Such efforts include many ICT for Development (ICT4D) projects. Media for Development has been applied to education, healthcare, business, disaster relief, corruption, minority empowerment, and local community engagement, among other development goals.


== Organizations ==
While development of the media sector is a common activity of many development organizations, there are a small number that engage in direct media development as their primary purpose.


=== International groups involved in media development ===


==== BBC Media Action ====
The BBC Media Action is a British implementer that does direct media development work. Earlier known as the BBC World Service Trust, it is active in over 40 countries and on every continent. While all its programs are media development-oriented, they focus on Emergency response, Health, Governance and human rights, Education, Environment, and Livelihoods.
The Trust is funded by external grants and voluntary contributions, mainly from the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), the European Union, UN agencies, and charitable foundations. They also receive a small amount of core support from the BBC (both in kind and cash).


==== DW Akademie - Deutsche Welle ====
DW Akademie is Deutsche Welle's international center for media development, media consulting and journalism training based in Bonn and Berlin. It offers training and consulting projects.
Since 1965 DW Akademie has been conducting a variety of media development projects to reinforce free and independent media, particularly in developing and transition countries. In Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia, DW Akademie engages in long-term partnerships with local broadcasters and media institutions.
DW Akademie's work is financed through public funding provided mainly by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the German Foreign Ministry and the European Union.
Reporters Without Borders
RSF monitors press freedom violations and releases an annual Press Freedom Index that ranks countries based on their score, with a higher number indicating more press freedom violations.


==== Internews Europe ====
Internews Europe is an international development organisation that specialises in supporting independent media and free information flows in fragile states, emerging democracies and some of the world's poorest countries. 


==== Thomson Foundation ====
The Thomson Foundation is an international training and development organisation. Since 1962, it has been helping raise the standards of journalism worldwide through training, consultancy and strategic advice. It seeks to ensure that all people have an honest, factual account of what is happening in the world through improving journalism and communication. Its online learning platform has capacity to produce training courses in multiple languages. The foundation is based in London.


==== DFID ====
The Department for International Development is the British government's main foreign aid agency. It is a significant funder of media development around the world. Similar to USAID (see above), media development is often a secondary goal within larger projects.


==== Journalists for Human Rights ====

Journalists for Human Rights (JHR) is an international media development non-governmental organization whose goal is "to make everyone in the world fully aware of their rights".
As Canada's largest media development organization, jhr has offices in Toronto, Canada (Head Office); Freetown, Sierra Leone; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Monrovia, Liberia. It also has representatives and non-profit status in the United States and the United Kingdom and operations in Ghana and Malawi.
jhr focuses its programming and efforts on strengthening the local media in countries with some level of freedom in the press, training local journalists on improving their human rights reporting skills. The organization is a pioneer in Rights Media, a new category of media development that has been defined as the “process of writing, collecting, editing, producing and distributing media that creates societal dialogue on human rights issues”. The only NGO in the world focused exclusively on human rights reporting, jhr's work in Rights Media aims to bridge the contentious divide between two camps in the sector: traditional 'media development' proponents and 'communication for development' practitioners. The former of the two focuses on developing infrastructure and professional capacity of media professionals and outlets. The latter focuses on getting particular messages into the public domain through the media. Rights Media does both — it focuses on building capacity of local media outlets to effectively get messages to the general public.


=== Multilateral organizations involved in media development ===


==== UNDP ====
Media development is only a part of the focus of the United Nations Development Program. UNDP has developed a list of Millennium Development Goals, none of which directly mention media, yet media factor into each of the goals.


==== UNESCO ====
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization funds some media development programs. Specifically, the Communication and Information Sector is responsible for a number of media-related programs. The International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) funds dozens of media development projects throughout the world each year and in 2008 launched the Media Development Indicators, a framework that assesses how the media can best contribute to, and benefit from, good governance and democratic development based on five categories assessing the media ecology of a given country.


==== The World Bank Institute ====
The World Bank Institute (WBI) is the capacity development branch of the World Bank. It provides learning programs, policy advice and technical assistance to policy makers, government and non-government agencies and development practitioners of developing countries.

=== American government organizations involved in media development ===
The U.S. government provides about half of American funding of media development abroad.


==== USAID ====
The U.S. Agency for International Development is the largest single U.S. funder, public or private, of independent media abroad. It spent $52.7 million in 2006 on international media sector development—about 37 percent of American funding, according to a study by the Center for International Media Assistance.
USAID's Office of Democracy and Governance (DCHA/DG) manages roughly $500,000 annually for media-related work. The bureau has two full-time media experts on staff who are consulted on media projects around the world.
USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), which was created in 1994 to provide a quick response mechanism in times of crisis, including post-war situations, spent $3 million on international media sector development in 2006.
The Europe and Eurasia Bureau (E&E) currently manages $130,000 annually to support publication of the Europe and Eurasia Media Sustainability Index, but its influence extends well beyond that amount. E&E's media advisor works with mission offices in the region, where most funding decisions are made, on how best to allocate resources for media work.


==== U.S. State Department ====
The State Department’s largest single funder of independent media sector development is its Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), which spent $11.8 million on the sector in 2006.

=== Other U.S. funders of media assistance ===
There are a number of foundations and other organizations in the U.S. that are responsible for a significant amount of media assistance funding, yet without a program engaged in direct “media development.” These projects are often called “communications for development” and are a very common form of media development.


==== The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) ====
The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is a U.S. non-profit soft power organization that was founded in 1983 to promote democracy. It is funded primarily through an annual allocation from the U.S. Congress, within the budget of USAID, the U.S. agency for development assistance, which is part of the U.S. State Department. Although administered as a private organization, its funding mostly comes from a governmental appropriation by Congress but was created by The Democracy Program as a bipartisan, private, non-profit corporation. In addition to its grants program, NED also supports and houses the Journal of Democracy, the World Movement for Democracy, the International Forum for Democratic Studies, the Reagan–Fascell Fellowship Program, the Network of Democracy Research Institutes, and the Center for International Media Assistance.
