The Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III is the third iteration of the flagship camera in the series of OM-D mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras produced by Olympus on the Micro Four-Thirds system. Released on February 28, 2020, it replaced the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II.
The E-M1 Mark III follows the E-M1 Mark II in embracing artificial intelligence-based features such as a deep learning autofocus system and multi-shot image processing to simulate neutral-density filters and a hi-res mode that allows the 20-megapixel camera to produce 50-megapixel images while handheld and 80-megapixel images while being on tripod. The camera also includes a 60 frames-per-second continuous shooting mode.

== Hi-resolution shot mode ==
In tripod and handheld mode, the camera rapidly captures 8 images (Tripod) or 16 images (Handheld) which are combined into 160 Mpx (tripod) or 320 MPx (handheld) of data, which the camera combines into 80 MPx (10368×7776 px) images in tripod mode or 50 MPx (8160×6120 px) image in handheld mode. The tripod mode ISO limit is 1600, or ISO 6400 in handheld mode. Hi-resolution pictures can be saved just in JPEG format. Handhold exposure can be set up to 4 seconds.
The benefit of hi-res mode is bigger resolution, low noise and an increase of dynamic range.


== Reception ==
The E-M1 Mark III was generally favored for improvements made over the Mark II, such as the introduction of a handheld mode and a lower base cost.
The camera took criticism for including the same 20-megapixel sensor, electronic viewfinder, and screen, as its predecessor, the Mark II. The same sensor is also present in the enthusiast-level Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III which was released just months earlier.
