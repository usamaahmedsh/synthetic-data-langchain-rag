PECOLA (Personal Companion for Older People Living Alone) is a caregiving companion robot developed by Taiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Designed specifically for elderly individuals living independently, PECOLA aims to integrate advanced technologies to provide safety, health monitoring, and social engagement functions.
PECOLA employs ambient intelligence and computer vision to assist older adults in their daily indoor lives. Key capabilities include fall detection via deep learning–based video content analysis, routine monitoring of eating and sleeping habits, and emergency notification through real-time alerts and two-way video communication with caregivers. In 2019, PECOLA received the CES Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.
