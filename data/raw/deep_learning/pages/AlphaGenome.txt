AlphaGenome is a large-scale deep-learning system developed by DeepMind to predict how segments of DNA regulate gene expression and how single-nucleotide variants may disrupt that regulation. It was launched on 25 June 2025.


== Background ==
Ever since the first draft of the human genome appeared in 2001, most of its over 3 billion letters have remained functionally opaque. AlphaGenome extends DeepMind's "Alpha" line of models beyond protein folding and chip design into the longstanding puzzle of the genome's non-coding dark matter.


== Model ==
AlphaGenome accepts stretches of up to one million base pairs, orders of magnitude longer than typical sequence-to-function models, and produces thousands of quantitative predictions, including gene-expression levels, chromatin accessibility, three-dimensional genome contacts and RNA-splicing junctions. The model was trained using genomic data from humans and mice, and its effectiveness on other organisms has not been tested. Current limitations include difficulty in predicting the effects of mutations on genes located more than 100,000 base pairs away.
