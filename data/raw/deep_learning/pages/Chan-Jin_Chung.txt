== Biography ==
Chung was born in Seoul, South Korea and earned a B.S. Computer Science degree from Hongik University in 1981. 
He began his career as a part-time mathematics instructor at the YMCA Academy in Seoul in 1979. From 1981 to 1982, he worked for Korea Electric Power Corporation, developing an online customer information system using COBOL and IMS Databases on an IBM 3031 mainframe.
From 1982 to 1992, Chung was a research scientist at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), where he contributed to the development of TDX switching systems, which later formed the foundation for the first commercialized CDMA system in the world. During this period, he was a visiting researcher at L.M. Ericsson in Stockholm, Sweden, developing telecommunication software modules for the AXE-10 system (1983–1984).
Chung received his Ph.D. in computer science from Wayne State University in 1997. His doctoral research focused on developing a self-adaptive artificial intelligence system inspired by cultural evolution, which was applied to nonlinear function optimization and the training of artificial neural networks.
 
In 2002, he and his master’s student Wei-Wen Chang won first place in a 3D design optimization competition sponsored by Honda R&D Europe GmbH as part of the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence.

In 2022, he was awarded a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) grant by the National Science Foundation.


== Achievements in STEaM, Robotics, and Computer Science Education ==
Chung is the founder of Robofest

, an international autonomous robotics competition established in 1999. As of 2025, more than 38,000 students from 18 U.S. states and 25 countries have participated.

He has also launched several educational programs integrating computer science, robotics, and STEaM fields, including RoboParade (2006),

RoboFashion and Dance Show (2007), 

Vision Centric Robot Challenge (VCC) (2007), 

Robot Music Camp (2013), 
 
Global Robotics Art Festival (GRAF) (2013), 

WRO-USA (2014), 
 
CS+PA²: Learning Computer Science with Physical Activities and Animation (2018), 
 

and Robofest eAcademy (2019).
Since 2003, Chung has served as faculty advisor for Lawrence Technological University’s Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) teams. His H2Bot team received the first-place design award in 2007 

His another team represented the United States in the RoboCup Four-Legged Robot Soccer Division the same year. 
The BigFoot II IGVC team won the Grand Award LESCOE Cup in 2016. 

As of 2025, he leads the ACTor (Autonomous Campus TranspORt) project using a fullscale drive-by-wire electric vehicle. The ACTor vehicle team won the Self-Drive Challenge at the IGVC in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025.
In 2011, IEEE USA awarded Chung the Citation of Honor for his contributions to STEM education.
