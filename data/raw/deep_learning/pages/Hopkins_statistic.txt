The Hopkins statistic (introduced by Brian Hopkins and John Gordon Skellam) is a way of measuring the cluster tendency of a data set. It belongs to the family of sparse sampling tests. It acts as a statistical hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the data is generated by a Poisson point process and are thus uniformly randomly distributed. If individuals are aggregated, then its value approaches 1, and if they are randomly distributed along the value tends to 0.5.


== Preliminaries ==
A typical formulation of the Hopkins statistic follows.

Let 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 be the set of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
 data points.
Generate a random sample 
  
    
      
        
          
            X
            ∼
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overset {\sim }{X}}}
  
 of 
  
    
      
        m
        ≪
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\ll n}
  
 data points sampled without replacement from 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
.
Generate a set 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  
 of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  
 uniformly randomly distributed data points.
Define two distance measures,

  
    
      
        
          u
          
            i
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{i},}
  
 the minimum distance (given some suitable metric) of 
  
    
      
        
          y
          
            i
          
        
        ∈
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y_{i}\in Y}
  
 to its nearest neighbour in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
, and

  
    
      
        
          w
          
            i
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle w_{i},}
  
 the minimum distance of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ∼
            
          
          
            i
          
        
        ∈
        
          
            X
            ∼
          
        
        ⊆
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overset {\sim }{x}}_{i}\in {\overset {\sim }{X}}\subseteq X}
  
 to its nearest neighbour 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
        ∈
        X
        ,
        
        
          
            
              x
              
                i
              
            
            ∼
          
        
        ≠
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{j}\in X,\,{\overset {\sim }{x_{i}}}\neq x_{j}.}

With the above notation, if the data is 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  
 dimensional, then the Hopkins statistic is defined as:

  
    
      
        H
        =

                  u
                  
                    i
                  
                  
                    d
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                ∑
                
                  i
                  =

                    i
                  
                  
                    d
                  
                
              
              +
              
                ∑
                
                  i
                  =
                  1

                  w
                  
                    i
                  
                  
                    d
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H={\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{m}{u_{i}^{d}}}{\sum _{i=1}^{m}{u_{i}^{d}}+\sum _{i=1}^{m}{w_{i}^{d}}}}\,}
