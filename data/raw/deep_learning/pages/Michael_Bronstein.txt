Michael Bronstein (Hebrew: מיכאל ברונשטיין; Russian: Михаил Бронштейн; born 1980) is a British-Israeli computer scientist and entrepreneur. He is a computer science professor at the University of Oxford and founding scientific director of Aithyra Institute at the Vienna Biocenter in Austria.


== Biography ==
Bronstein received his PhD from the Technion in 2007. Since 2010, he has been a professor at University of Lugano, Switzerland, affiliated with the Institute of Computational Science and IDSIA. Between 2018 and 2021, he held the Chair in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition in the Department of Computing, Imperial College London. In 2022, he joined the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford as the DeepMind Professor of Artificial Intelligence.
Bronstein has held visiting appointments at Stanford University between 2009 and 2010, and at Harvard University and MIT between 2017 and 2018. He has been affiliated with the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University (as a Radcliffe fellow, 2017-2018), the Institute for Advanced Study at Technical University of Munich (as Rudolf Diesel industrial fellow, 2017-2019) and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (as visitor, 2020). Since 2024, he is also a Professeur titulaire at EPFL and since 2025, an Honorary Professor at the University of Vienna and Technical University of Vienna. 
Bronstein was a co-founder of the Israeli startup Invision, developing a coded-light 3D range sensor. The company was acquired by Intel in 2012 and has become the foundation of Intel RealSense technology. Bronstein served as Principal Engineer at Intel between 2012 and 2019. 
In 2018, Bronstein founded Fabula AI, a London-based startup aiming to solve the problem of online disinformation by looking at how it spreads on social networks. The company was acquired by Twitter in 2019. He served as Head of Graph Learning Research at Twitter between 2019 and 2023.


== Work ==
Bronstein's research interests are broadly in theoretical and computational geometric methods for data analysis. His research encompasses a spectrum of applications ranging from machine learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition to geometry processing, computer graphics, and imaging. He is mainly known for his research on deformable 3D shape analysis and "geometric deep learning" (a term he coined), generalizing neural network architectures to manifolds and graphs. These methods have been applied to molecular design.
