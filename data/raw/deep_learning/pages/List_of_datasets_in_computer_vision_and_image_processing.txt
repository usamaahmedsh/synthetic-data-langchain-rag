This is a list of datasets for machine learning research. It is part of the list of datasets for machine-learning research. These datasets consist primarily of images or videos for tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and multi-label classification.


== Object detection and recognition ==


=== 3D Objects ===
See (Calli et al, 2015) for a review of 33 datasets of 3D object as of 2015. See (Downs et al., 2022) for a review of more datasets as of 2022.


=== Object detection and recognition for autonomous vehicles ===


== Facial recognition ==
In computer vision, face images have been used extensively to develop facial recognition systems, face detection, and many other projects that use images of faces. See  for a curated list of datasets, focused on the pre-2005 period.


== Action recognition ==


== Handwriting and character recognition ==


== Aerial images ==


== Underwater images ==


== Other images ==
