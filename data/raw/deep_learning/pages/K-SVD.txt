In applied mathematics, k-SVD is a dictionary learning algorithm for creating a dictionary for sparse representations, via a singular value decomposition approach. k-SVD is a generalization of the k-means clustering method, and it works by iteratively alternating between sparse coding the input data based on the current dictionary, and updating the atoms in the dictionary to better fit the data. It is structurally related to the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm. k-SVD can be found widely in use in applications such as image processing, audio processing, biology, and document analysis.

k-SVD is a kind of generalization of k-means, as follows. The k-means clustering  can be also regarded as a method of sparse representation. That is, finding the best possible codebook  to represent the data samples 
  
    
      
        {
        
          y
          
            i
          
        
        
          }
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            M
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{y_{i}\}_{i=1}^{M}}
  
  by nearest neighbor, by solving

  
    
      
        
        
          min
          
            D
            ,
            X
          
        
        {
        ‖
        Y
        −
        D
        X
        
          ‖
          
            F
          
          
            2
          
        
        }
        
        
          subject to 
        
        ∀
        i
        ,
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        =
        
          e
          
            k
          
        
        
           for some 
        
        k
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \quad \min \limits _{D,X}\{\|Y-DX\|_{F}^{2}\}\qquad {\text{subject to }}\forall i,x_{i}=e_{k}{\text{ for some }}k.}
  

which is nearly equivalent to

  
    
      
        
        
          min
          
            D
            ,
            X
          
        
        {
        ‖
        Y
        −
        D
        X
        
          ‖
          
            F
          
          
            2
          
        
        }
        
        
          subject to 
        
        
        ∀
        i
        ,
        ‖
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        
          ‖
          
            0
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \quad \min \limits _{D,X}\{\|Y-DX\|_{F}^{2}\}\qquad {\text{subject to }}\quad \forall i,\|x_{i}\|_{0}=1}
  

which is k-means that allows "weights".
The letter F denotes the Frobenius norm. The sparse representation term 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        =
        
          e
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}=e_{k}}
  
 enforces k-means algorithm to use only one atom (column) in dictionary 
  
    
      
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle D}
  
. To relax this constraint, the target of the k-SVD algorithm is to represent the signal as a linear combination of atoms in 
  
    
      
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle D}
  
.
The k-SVD algorithm follows the construction flow of the k-means algorithm. However, in contrast to k-means,  in order to achieve a linear combination of atoms in 
  
    
      
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle D}
  
, the sparsity term of the constraint is relaxed so that the number of nonzero entries of each column 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}}
  
 can be more than 1, but less than a number 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{0}}
  
.
So, the objective function becomes

  
    
      
        
        
          min
          
            D
            ,
            X
          
        
        {
        ‖
        Y
        −
        D
        X
        
          ‖
          
            F
          
          
            2
          
        
        }
        
        
          subject to 
        
        
        ∀
        i
        
        ,
        ‖
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        
          ‖
          
            0
          
        
        ≤
        
          T
          
            0
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \quad \min \limits _{D,X}\{\|Y-DX\|_{F}^{2}\}\qquad {\text{subject to }}\quad \forall i\;,\|x_{i}\|_{0}\leq T_{0}.}
  

or in another objective form

  
    
      
        
        
          min
          
            D
            ,
            X
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            i
          
        
        ‖
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        
          ‖
          
            0
          
        
        
        
          subject to 
        
        
        ∀
        i
        
        ,
        ‖
        Y
        −
        D
        X
        
          ‖
          
            F
          
          
            2
          
        
        ≤
        ϵ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \quad \min \limits _{D,X}\sum _{i}\|x_{i}\|_{0}\qquad {\text{subject to }}\quad \forall i\;,\|Y-DX\|_{F}^{2}\leq \epsilon .}
  

In the k-SVD algorithm, the 
  
    
      
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle D}
  
 is first fixed and the best coefficient matrix 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 is found. As finding the truly optimal 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
 is hard, we use an approximation pursuit method. Any algorithm such as OMP, the orthogonal matching pursuit can be used for the calculation of the coefficients, as long as it can supply a solution with a fixed and predetermined number of nonzero entries 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{0}}
  
.
After the sparse coding task, the next is to search for a better dictionary 
  
    
      
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle D}
  
. However, finding the whole dictionary all at a time is impossible, so the process is to update only one column of the dictionary 
  
    
      
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle D}
  
 each time, while fixing 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  
. The update of the 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  
-th column is done by rewriting the penalty term as

, this shrinks the row vector

        =
        
          E

    {\displaystyle {\tilde {E}}_{k}=E_{k}\Omega _{k}}
  
.
So the minimization problem as mentioned before becomes

        =

            k

                ~
              
            
          
          
            k
          
          
            T
          
        
        
          ‖
          
            F
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|E_{k}\Omega _{k}-d_{k}x_{k}^{\text{T}}\Omega _{k}\|_{F}^{2}=\|{\tilde {E}}_{k}-d_{k}{\tilde {x}}_{k}^{\text{T}}\|_{F}^{2}}
  

and can be done by directly using SVD. SVD decomposes 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                E
                ~
              
            
          
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tilde {E}}_{k}}
  
 into 
  
    
      
        U
        Δ
        
          V
          
            T
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle U\Delta V^{\text{T}}}
  
. The solution for 
  
    
      
        
          d
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle d_{k}}
  
 is the first column of U, the coefficient  vector 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                x
                ~
              
            
          
          
            k
          
          
            T
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tilde {x}}_{k}^{\text{T}}}
  
 as the first column of 
  
    
      
        V
        ×
        Δ
        (
        1
        ,
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle V\times \Delta (1,1)}
  
. After updating the whole dictionary, the process then turns to iteratively solve X, then iteratively solve D.


== Limitations ==
Choosing an appropriate "dictionary" for a dataset is a non-convex problem, and k-SVD operates by an iterative update which does not guarantee to find the global optimum. However, this is common to other algorithms for this purpose, and k-SVD works fairly well in practice.
