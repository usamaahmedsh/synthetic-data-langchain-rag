== Medical image analysis foundations ==

Medical imaging is a range of imaging techniques and technologies that enables clinicians to visualize the internal structures of the human body. It aids in diagnosing, treating, and monitoring various medical conditions, thus allowing healthcare professionals to obtain detailed and non-invasive images of organs, tissues, and physiological processes.
Medical imaging has evolved, driven by technological advancements and scientific understanding. Today, it encompasses modalities such as X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, nuclear medicine, and digital pathology, each offering capabilities and insights into human anatomy and pathology.
The images produced by these medical imaging modalities are interpreted by radiologists, trained specialists in analyzing and diagnosing medical conditions based on the visual information captured in the images. In recent years, the field has witnessed advancements in computer-aided diagnosis, integrating artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to automatize medical image analysis and assist radiologists in detecting abnormalities and improving diagnostic accuracy.


== Features ==
MONAI provides a robust suite of libraries, tools, and software development kits (SDKs) that encompass the entire process of building medical imaging applications. It offers a comprehensive range of resources to support every stage of developing artificial intelligence solutions in the field of medical imaging, from initial annotation (MONAI Label), through models development and evaluation (MONAI Core), and final application deployment (MONAI deploy application SDK).


=== Medical data labeling ===

MONAI Label is a versatile tool that enhances the image labeling and learning process by incorporating AI assistance. It simplifies the task of annotating new datasets by leveraging AI algorithms and user interactions. Through this collaboration, MONAI Label trains an AI model for a specific task and continually improves its performance as it receives additional annotated images. The tool offers a range of features and integrations that streamline the annotation workflow and ensure seamless integration with existing medical imaging platforms.

AI-assisted annotation: MONAI Label assists researchers and practitioners in medical imaging by suggesting annotations based on user interactions by utilizing AI algorithms. This AI assistance significantly reduces the time and effort required for labeling new datasets, allowing users to focus on more complex tasks. The suggestions provided by MONAI Label enhance efficiency and accuracy in the annotation process.
Continuous learning: as users provide additional annotated images, MONAI Label utilizes this data to improve its performance over time. The tool updates its AI model with the newly acquired annotations, enhancing its ability to label images and adapt to specific tasks.
Integration with medical imaging platforms: MONAI Label integrates with medical imaging platforms such as 3D Slicer, Open Health Imaging Foundation viewer for radiology, QuPath, and digital slide archive for pathology. These integrations enable communication between MONAI Label and existing medical imaging tools, facilitating collaborative workflows and ensuring compatibility with established platforms.
Custom viewer integration: developers have the flexibility to integrate MONAI Label into their custom image viewers using the provided server and client APIs. These APIs are abstracted and thoroughly documented, facilitating smooth integration with bespoke applications.


=== Deep learning model development and evaluation ===

Within MONAI Core, researchers can find a collection of tools and functionalities for dataset processing, loading, deep learning (DL) model implementation, and evaluation. These utilities allow researchers to evaluate the performance of their models. MONAI Core offers customizable training pipelines, enabling users to construct and train models that support various learning approaches such as supervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised learning. Additionally, users have the flexibility to implement different computing strategies to optimize the training process.

Image I/O, processing, and augmentation: domain-specific APIs are available to transform data into arrays and different dictionary formats. Additionally, patch sampling strategies enable the generation of class-balanced samples from high-dimensional images. This ensures that the sampling process maintains balance and fairness across different classes present in the data. Furthermore, invertible transforms provided by MONAI Core allow for the reversal of model outputs to a previous preprocessing step. This is achieved by leveraging tracked metadata and applied operations, enabling researchers to interpret and analyze model results in the context of the original data.
Datasets and data loading: multi-threaded cache-based datasets support high-frequency data loading, public dataset availability accelerates model deployment and performance reproducibility, and custom APIs support compressed, image- and patched, and multimodal data sources.
Differentiable components, networks, losses, and optimizers: MONAI Core provides network layers and blocks that can seamlessly handle spatial 1D, 2D, and 3D inputs. Users have the flexibility to effortlessly integrate these layers, blocks, and networks into their personalized pipelines. The library also includes commonly used loss functions, such as Dice loss, Tversky loss, and Dice focal loss, which have been (re-)implemented from literature. In addition, MONAI Core offers numerical optimization techniques like Novograd and utilities like learning rate finder to facilitate the optimization process.
Evaluation: MONAI Core provides a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of medical image models. These metrics include mean Dice, receiving operating characteristic curves, confusion matrices, Hausdorff distance, surface distance, and occlusion sensitivity. The metric summary report generates statistical information such as mean, median, maximum, minimum, percentile, and standard deviation for the computed evaluation metrics.
GPU acceleration, performance profiling, and optimization: MONAI leverages a range of tools including DLProf, Nsight, NVTX, and NVML to detect performance bottlenecks. The distributed data-parallel APIs seamlessly integrate with the native PyTorch distributed module, PyTorch-ignite distributed module, Horovod, XLA, and the SLURM platform.
DL model collection: by offering the MONAI Model Zoo, MONAI establishes itself as a platform that enables researchers and data scientists to access and share cutting-edge models developed by the community. Leveraging the MONAI Bundle format, users can seamlessly and efficiently utilize any model within the MONAI frameworks (Core, Label, or Deploy).
