The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT is an engineering department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It offers degrees of Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Doctor of Philosophy, and Doctor of Science. 


== History ==
The curriculum for the electrical engineering program was created in 1882, and was the first such program in the country. It was initially taught by the physics faculty.  In 1902, the Institute set up a separate Electrical Engineering department. The department was renamed to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1975, to highlight the new addition of computer science to the program.
