Rebelle is a raster graphics editor for digital painting and drawing, designed to simulate oils, acrylics, watercolors, pencils and other traditional paint media on a digital canvas. It is developed and published by the Slovak company Escape Motions. The software is intended to be used by everyone interested in digital painting, from children to professional digital painters, concept artists and illustrators. It was first released in 2015 and has since gained popularity among artists seeking to replicate the natural and organic feel of traditional tools in a digital environment.
Rebelle’s paint engine simulates various types of wet and dry media. The pigment color mixing, oil thickness, watercolor diffusion, and NanoPixel technology work together to realistically emulate how natural media interact with each other and with the canvas.
The first Rebelle version was released in 2015. Escape Motions was accepted to present it at the SIGGRAPH’s 2016 Appy Hour where independent app developers introduce their apps to the attendees.
The current version is Rebelle 8, released in Early Access in July 2025, followed by the full release in October 2025. Rebelle is currently available in two different editions: Standard and Pro which includes additional features: Bristle brushes, RealShader with SoftShadows, Pigment color mixing, NanoPixel technology, Smooth scaling, Metallic materials, Advanced PSD import & export, Photoshop plugin, Color management, Fractal image resizing, WebSocket control input and Motion IO.
Rebelle is compatible with Windows and MacOS and is designed to be used with a tablet PC or graphics tablet, but it can be used with a computer mouse as well.


== Tools and features ==
Rebelle includes wet media tools: oils, acrylics, watercolors, ink pens, and dry tools: pastels, pencils, charcoals, markers, and airbrushes. Other tools are blend, smudge, liquify, clone, fill, water, dry, blow, color picker, tilt, transform tools, selection tools, and more.
Rebelle includes different types of customizable brushes with various brush textures. It offers multiple paper surfaces that serve as a background for the painting and dynamically interact with the painting tools. The software has a touch gesture system for touch and multitouch displays, which supports simultaneous zooming, rotating, and panning.


=== List of main features ===


== Technology ==


=== Watercolor and wet media simulation, DropEngine ===
Rebelle’s watercolor simulation is built upon real-world color mixing, blending, moistening, and drying. The fluid simulation is based on Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the realistic fluid flow occurring in nature. Watercolor simulation in Rebelle is an extensive sandbox that consists internally of multiple layers, used to calculate the water and paint simulation, wetting, drying, and re-wetting already dried colors. Users can paint, erase, blend, and smear the painting, tilt the canvas to create water drops, and various watercolor effects, which are calculated in real-time. The simulation offers a realistic granulation effect as the paint dries into the paper.


=== Thick paint and impasto ===
Rebelle supports laying down thick layers of paint and lets users control the impasto depth of oils and acrylics. Creating thick or thin layers is possible with the Impasto engine, which uses a height map of the painting's structure. 
Rebelle 8 introduced significant changes to the way impasto effects are rendered within the software. The update features a system called RealShader, described as a new generation of Rebelle materials that utilize real photographs as environment maps. These environment maps are employed for image-based lighting, resulting in more realistic light interactions on raised paint surfaces.
In addition to RealShader, Rebelle 8 includes a SoftShadows setting, which allows raised brushstrokes to cast ray-traced shadows. This enhancement provides a greater sense of depth and three-dimensionality to digital paint textures.


=== Pigment color mixing ===
Rebelle 5 released in December 2021 introduced physical color mixing based on traditional pigments. It produces saturated gradients with hue shifts and natural secondary colors during blending. As a result of this colors mixing model, colors mix realistically, e.g. yellow and blue colors make green color. The implementation is based on the Mixbox model developed by Secret Weapons. Their paper Practical Pigment Mixing for Digital Painting developed a mixing approach that rectifies the behavior of colors by leveraging the Kubelka–Munk model and was accepted for Siggraph talk in 2021.


=== NanoPixel ===
Rebelle 5 Pro introduced technology for resizing paintings and canvases in real time called NanoPixel. The technology is based on machine-learning algorithms, especially deep learning and it allows exporting 16x larger paintings. NanoPixel depends on GPU power and OpenGL for rendering the painting.


=== Fractal image processing ===
Rebelle 6 Pro released in December 2022 brings the image recognition machine learning algorithm for keeping the image quality and sharp details when using the Warp and Liquify tools, transforming and deforming layers or objects on the canvas.


=== Metallic materials ===
Rebelle 7 Pro features Metallic materials. They work with the Oil & Acrylics tool, making it possible to mimic the look of real-world metallic paints. Users can control the look of materials with various settings.


=== Photoshop plugin ===
Rebelle Pro offers a Photoshop plugin called Escape Motions Connect. It is a JSX file that can be installed into Photoshop as a panel and allows the exporting of layers between Rebelle and Photoshop. The plugin is compatible with Photoshop CC 2015 and newer.


=== Papers and art surfaces ===
Rebelle introduced a new approach to how the background in digital painting software reacts to the paint by developing art surfaces based on real-world papers. This includes hot-pressed, cold-pressed, rough papers, canvases, washi, handmade, and watercolor papers of all kinds that can influence how the paint reacts to the surface. Version 7 featured rendering based on ray tracing which made it possible for the paint to react to the actual bumps and irregular heights of the paper textures.


== Versions ==
The current version is Rebelle 8 and is available in two editions: Rebelle standard and Rebelle Pro which includes everything from standard edition plus additional Pro features: Bristle brushes, RealShader with SoftShadows, Pigment color mixing, NanoPixel technology, Smooth scaling, Metallic materials, Advanced PSD import & export, Photoshop plugin, Color management, Fractal image resizing, WebSocket control input and Motion IO.


=== Free trial version ===
A 30-day free trial version is available on the developer’s website.
