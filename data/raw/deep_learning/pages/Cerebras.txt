== History ==
Cerebras was founded in 2015 by Andrew Feldman, Gary Lauterbach, Michael James, Sean Lie and Jean-Philippe Fricker. These five founders worked together at SeaMicro, which was started in 2007 by Feldman and Lauterbach and was later sold to AMD in 2012 for $334 million.
In May 2016, Cerebras secured $27 million in series A funding led by Benchmark, Foundation Capital and Eclipse Ventures.
In December 2016, series B funding was led by Coatue Management, followed in January 2017 with series C funding led by VY Capital.
In November 2018, Cerebras closed its series D round with $88 million, making the company a unicorn. Investors in this round included Altimeter, VY Capital, Coatue, Foundation Capital, Benchmark, and Eclipse.
On August 19, 2019, Cerebras announced its first-generation Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE).’
In November 2019, Cerebras closed its series E round with over $270 million for a valuation of $2.4 billion.
In 2020, the company announced an office in Japan and partnership with Tokyo Electron Devices.
In April 2021, Cerebras announced the CS-2 based on the company's Wafer Scale Engine Two (WSE-2), which has 850,000 cores. In August 2021, the company announced its brain-scale technology that can run a neural network with over 120 trillion connections.
In November 2021, Cerebras announced that it had raised an additional $250 million in Series F funding, valuing the company at over $4 billion. The Series F financing round was led by Alpha Wave Ventures and Abu Dhabi Growth Fund (ADG). To date, the company has raised $720 million in financing.
In August 2022, Cerebras was honored by the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The museum added to its permanent collection and unveiled a new display featuring the WSE-2—the biggest computer chip made so far—marking an "epochal" achievement in the history of fabricating transistors as an integrated part.
Cerebras was named to the Forbes AI 50 in April 2024 and the TIME 100 Most Influential Companies list in May 2024.
Cerebras filed its prospectus for initial public offering (IPO) in September 2024, with the intention of listing on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker 'CBRS'. The prospectus indicated that most of its revenue at the time came from Emirati AI holding company G42. A week after the filing, it was reported that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States was reviewing G42's investment into the company, leading to a potential delay in its IPO. In a May 2025 interview, CEO Andrew Feldman said the company had obtained clearance from a U.S. committee to sell shares to G42 and he hoped that Cerebras would go public in 2025. 
In late September 2025, the company announced it raised $1.1 billion in a new funding round (Series G) that has valued Cerebras at $8.1 billion. In October 2025, the company filed to withdraw its IPO registration. Co-founder and CEO Andrew Feldman said in an interview that Cerebras still intends to go public.

The Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) is a single, wafer-scale integrated processor that includes compute, memory and interconnect fabric. The WSE-1 powers the Cerebras CS-1, Cerebras’ first-generation AI computer. It is a 19-inch rack-mounted appliance designed for AI training and inference workloads in a datacenter. The CS-1 includes a single WSE primary processor with 400,000 processing cores, as well as twelve 100 Gigabit Ethernet connections to move data in and out. The WSE-1 has 1.2 trillion transistors, 400,000 compute cores and 18 gigabytes of memory.
In April 2021, Cerebras announced the CS-2 AI system based on the 2nd-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2), manufactured by the 7 nm process of TSMC . It is 26 inches tall and fits in one-third of a standard data center rack.
The Cerebras WSE-2 has 850,000 cores and 2.6 trillion transistors.
The WSE-2 expanded on-chip SRAM to 40 gigabytes, memory bandwidth to 20 petabytes per second and total fabric bandwidth to 220 petabits per second.
In August 2021, the company announced a system which connects multiple integrated circuits (commonly called "chips") into a neural network with many connections.
 It enables a single system to support AI models with more than 120 trillion parameters.
In June 2022, Cerebras set a record for the largest AI models ever trained on one device.  Cerebras said that for the first time ever, a single CS-2 system with one Cerebras wafer can train models with up to 20 billion parameters. The Cerebras CS-2 system can train multibillion-parameter natural language processing (NLP) models including GPT-3XL 1.3 billion models, as well as GPT-J 6B, GPT-3 13B and GPT-NeoX 20B with reduced software complexity and infrastructure.
In September 2022, Cerebras announced that it can patch its chips together to create what would be the largest-ever computing cluster for AI computing. A Wafer-Scale Cluster can connect up to 192 CS-2 AI systems into a cluster, while a cluster of 16 CS-2 AI systems can create a computing system with 13.6 million cores for natural language processing. The key to the new Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster is the exclusive use of data parallelism to train, which is the preferred approach for all AI work.
In November 2022, Cerebras unveiled the supercomputer, Andromeda, which combines 16 WSE-2 chips into one cluster with 13.5 million AI-optimized cores, delivering up to 1 Exaflop of AI computing horsepower, or at least one quintillion (10 to the power of 18) operations per second. The entire system consumes 500 kW, which was a drastically lower amount than somewhat-comparable GPU-accelerated supercomputers.
In November 2022, Cerebras announced its partnership with Cirrascale Cloud Services to provide a flat-rate "pay-per-model" compute time for its Cerebras AI Model Studio. The service is said to reduce the cost—compared to the similar cloud services on the market—by half while increasing speed up to eight times faster.
In July 2023, Cerebras and UAE-based G42 unveiled the world's largest network of nine interlinked supercomputers, Condor Galaxy, for AI model training. The first supercomputer, named Condor Galaxy 1 (CG-1), boasts 4 exaFLOPs of FP16 performance and 54 million cores. In November 2023, the Condor Galaxy 2 (CG-2) was announced, also containing 4 exaFLOPs and 54 million cores.
In March 2024, the companies broke ground on the Condor Galaxy 3 (CG-3), which can hit 8 exaFLOPs of performance and contains 58 million AI-optimized cores.
In March 2024, the company also introduced WSE-3, a 5nm-based chip hosting 4 trillion transistors and 900,000 AI-optimized cores, the basis of the CS-3 computer. Cerebras also announced a collaboration with Dell Technologies, unveiled in June 2024, for AI compute infrastructure for generative AI.
In August 2024, Cerebras unveiled its AI inference service, claiming to be the fastest in the world and, in many cases, ten to twenty times faster than systems built using the dominant technology, Nvidia's H100 "Hopper" graphics processing unit, or GPU.
As of October 2024, Cerebras' performance advantage for inference is even larger when running the latest Llama 3.2 models. The jump in AI inference performance between August and October is a big one, at a factor of 3.5X, and it opens up the gap between Cerebras CS-3 systems running on premises or in clouds operated by Cerebras.
In March 2025, Cerebras announced six new datacenters across the United States and Europe, increasing the inference capacity twentyfold to over 40 million tokens per second.
In April 2025, Meta announced a partnership with Cerebras to power the new Llama API, offering developers inference speeds up to 18 times faster than with traditional GPU-based solutions. In May, Cerebras announced that it beats NVIDIA Blackwell in Llama 4 Inference with more than double the performance at more than 2,500 tokens per second/user on the 400B parameter Llama 4 Maverick model. Also in April the company in partnership with a Canadian chip startup, Ranovus, was awarded a DARPA $45 million contract to improve U.S. military computer energy use and connections.
In May 2025, Cerebras unveiled Qwen3-32B, an open-weight LLM model built for smart, high speed reasoning and performance. In July, Cerebras unveiled Qwen3-235B with full 131K context support on its inference cloud platform.
