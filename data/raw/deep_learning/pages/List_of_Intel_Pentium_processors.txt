=== P6 based Pentiums ===

Desktop processors based on the P6 microarchitecture were marketed as Pentium Pro, Pentium II and Pentium III, as well as variations of these names.


=== NetBurst based Pentiums ===

Desktop processors based on the NetBurst microarchitecture were marketed as Pentium 4 and Pentium D.


=== Core based Pentiums ===
Earlier E5xxx desktop processors based on the Core microarchitecture were marketed as Pentium Dual-Core, while later E5xxx and all E6xxx models were named Pentium. Note however, that several resellers will still refer to the newer generation processors as Pentium Dual-Core.


==== "Allendale", "Conroe" (65 nm) ====

The Intel Pentium Dual-Core processors, E2140, E2160, E2180, E2200, and E2220 use the Allendale core, which includes 2 MB of native L2 cache, with half disabled leaving only 1 MB. This compares to the higher end Conroe core which features 4 MB L2 Cache natively. Intel has shifted its product lines having the Core 2 line as Mainstream/Performance, Pentium Dual-Core as Mainstream, and the new Celeron (based on the Conroe-L core) as Budget/Value.

Based on the 64-bit Core microarchitecture.
