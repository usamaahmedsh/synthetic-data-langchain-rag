= Typecast (AI voice generator) =
Typecast is an AI-powered content creation platform specializing in emotionally expressive text-to-speech (TTS), avatar generation and video creation. Developed by the AI startup Neosapience, Inc., the platform enables users to create audio and video content from text by leveraging artificial intelligence.
In addition to its creator-focused platform, Typecast also provides APIs that are optimized for building conversational AI voice agents.


== Overview ==
Launched in 2019 by Neosapience, Typecast has gained widespread adoption, with over 2 million users in 225 countries as of 2025. The company is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, with an additional office in San Mateo, California.


== History and funding ==
Neosapience was founded on 9 November 2017 by Taesu Kim and Juncheol Cho, both former Qualcomm engineers with expertise in large-scale speech and signal processing.
The company remains privately held and raised a Series B funding round in February 2022, with investors including BRV Capital Management.
According to available data, total funding is estimated at US$26.8 million.


== Technology and features ==
Typecast is an AI-driven platform that converts text into high-quality synthetic speech and can be used to create video content by combining audio with visual assets. The service is built on Neosapience’s Speech Synthesis Foundation Model (SSFM), which enables natural and expressive vocal performance suitable for production use.


=== Voice generation and speech synthesis ===
Typecast provides a large library of AI-generated voices and allows users to adjust tone, pacing, and other vocal characteristics through an interface designed for detailed performance control. The platform also supports voice cloning, enabling replication of specific voices for personalized or branded audio output.


=== Emotional expression capabilities ===
The platform includes systems that automatically adjust emotional delivery based on context. It also allows users to define specific emotional styles through prompting and reuse those styles across different projects without additional setup. In addition, users can record their own expressive performances and apply those emotional characteristics to any AI-generated voice, enabling more personalized output.


=== Multilingual support ===
Typecast supports 6 core languages, including English, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and 31 additional global languages.


=== Talking avatars and video generation ===
The platform includes neural animation and lip-sync systems that produce talking avatars synchronized with generated speech.


=== API and developer tools ===
Typecast provides an API that enables programmatic access to its voice library and performance controls, allowing developers to adjust parameters such as tone, pitch, speed, and emotion.
The API is built for sophisticated conversational AI experiences, particularly advanced virtual agents that require expressive, controllable, and emotionally adaptive speech. Leveraging the same SSFM architecture that supports the platform’s speech synthesis, the API is additionally utilized in emotional companion and entertainment agents, AI tutoring and interactive learning systems, and a wide range of AI productivity and assistant tools.


== Reception ==
In 2022, TechCrunch highlighted Typecast's potential to transform content creation by allowing users to generate voice and video content without traditional studio recording or editing. Reporter Kate Park noted that one of Typecast's distinguishing features was its ability to produce human-like emotions and speaking styles, as well as its advanced control over prosody and performance.
In 2023, VentureBeat praised Typecast for its ability to replicate human emotion in synthetic voices. Journalist Taryn Plumb described the platform's “Cross-Speaker Emotion Transfer” as a breakthrough that allows users to imbue AI-generated voices with authentic emotional depth, based on only a small sample of speech audio.
