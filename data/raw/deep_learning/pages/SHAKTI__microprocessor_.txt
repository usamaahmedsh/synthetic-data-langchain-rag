V. Kamakoti carried out the SHAKTI Microprocessor Project, at Prathap Subrahmanyam Centre for Digital Intelligence and Secure Hardware Architecture (Department of Computer Science & Engineering, IIT Madras). The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology supports it through its Digital India RISC-V initiative.


== Processors ==
Shakti processors are based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). The processors are designed to have either 22 nm process fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) or 180 nm process complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology nodes depending on the manufacturing semiconductor fabrication plant (foundry).
Shakti plans a family of processors as part of its road-map, catering to different segments of the market. They have been broadly categorized into "Base Processors", "Multi-Core Processors" and "Experimental Processors".
The E and C-classes core are for the Internet of things (IoT), embedded system, and desktop computer markets. The processor design is free of any royalty and is open-source licensed under the modified BSD License.
E-class and C-class cores are both implemented in Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV) language, a Haskell dialect.
The Shakti project aims to build 6 variants of processors based on the RISC-V ISA.
