Founded in 2019, the startup company began from Tsinghua University and was later spun out as an independent company.

In March 2024, Zhipu AI said that they were developing a Sora-like technology to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). In July 2024, they debuted their "Ying" text-to-video model.
After OpenAI announced an API block for their services in some areas beginning in July 2024, Zhipu AI have announced a "Special Migration Program" for OpenAI API users.
In October 2024, Zhipu AI released GLM-4.0, an open-source end-to-end speech large language model. The model can replicate human-like interactions and has the capability to adjust its tone, emotion, or dialect based from user's preference.
In May 2025, the company received a 61.28 million yuan deal from the Chinese government for city projects in Hangzhou.
In July 2025, Zhipu AI released GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5 Air, their next generation language models which topped several popular benchmarks. Along with the release of their model, the company also rebranded itself as Z.ai internationally. In August 2025, Z.ai announced that their GLM models are compatible with Huawei’s Ascend processors. On August 11, 2025, Z.ai released a new vision-language model (VLM) with a total of 106B parameters, GLM-4.5V, achieving SOTA against other open-source VLMs such as Alibaba's Qwen2.5-VL and StepFun's Step-3. In late September 2025, the company released GLM 4.6 using China's domestic chips such as those from Cambricon Technologies.
