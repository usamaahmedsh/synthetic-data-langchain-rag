Nano Banana (officially Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) is an image generation and editing model powered by generative artificial intelligence and developed by Google DeepMind, a subsidiary of Google. A text-to-image variant of the Gemini family of large language models, it was launched in August 2025 as a feature within the Gemini chatbot and other Google products. "Nano Banana" was the codename used for the model while it was undergoing secret public testing on LMArena. Upon release, it became a viral Internet sensation on social media, particularly for its photorealistic "3D figurine" images.


== History ==
Nano Banana first appeared publicly as an anonymous model on the crowd-sourced AI evaluation platform LMArena on August 12, 2025. It was released publicly on August 26, 2025 through the Gemini app and related Google AI services. The nickname "Nano Banana" originated from internal placeholder naming but caught on quickly with the internet when the codename started being used in online groups. Google later confirmed its identity as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image in an official announcement upon public release. On November 20, 2025, DeepMind released Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3.0 Pro Image) with improved text rendering and world knowledge. 


== Features ==
The model lets users change hairstyles, backdrops, and mix photos with natural language cues. Subject consistency allows the same person or item to be recognized across revisions.
Multi-image fusion joins photographs into one seamless output, and world knowledge allows context-aware changes. It also provides SynthID watermarking, which is an invisible digital signature in outputs to identify AI-generated information.


== Launch and adoption ==
Following its release, Nano Banana was made available in the Gemini app, Google AI Studio, and through Vertex AI. According to Google, it helped attract over 10 million new users to the Gemini app and facilitated more than 200 million image edits within weeks of launch.


== Cultural impact ==
People started to connect Nano Banana with a viral craze in which people turned their selfies into 3D figurines that looked like toys. The event circulated quickly on sites like Instagram and X (previously Twitter).
By adding the model to X, users could tag Nano Banana directly in posts to make photos from prompts, which made it even more popular.


== Reception ==
A September 2025 review in TechRadar reported that Nano Banana was more realistic and consistent across multiple prompts than ChatGPT's image generation. A review in Tom's Guide praised its ability to handle creative and lively image edits.
Another review in PC Gamer mentioned that the model did not have some basic editing tools like cropping, and that the product sometimes did not apply changes, but reverted back to the original image instead.
Nano Banana showed good performance in architectural visualization, for producing imagery at the correct scale even with complex geometry.
