Arthur Mensch (born 17 July 1992) is a French artificial intelligence researcher and entrepreneur, best known as the co-founder and CEO of the Paris-based AI company Mistral AI. He is one of the most prominent figures in Europe’s AI ecosystem and is often cited in debates on AI policy, sovereign technology, and open models.


== Early life and education ==
Arthur Mensch was born on 17 July 1992 in Sèvres, in the Hauts-de-Seine department near Paris. He is the son of a businessman father and a physics teacher mother.
He studied at the École Polytechnique and Télécom Paris, then specialized in “Mathematics, Vision, Learning” at Université Paris-Saclay. From 2015 to 2018, he completed a PhD at Inria / NeuroSpin (CEA, Saclay), supervised by Bertrand Thirion, Gaël Varoquaux and Julien Mairal, on predictive models and stochastic optimization for large-scale functional MRI analysis.
From 2018 to 2020, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the École normale supérieure (Paris), working on optimal transport and stochastic optimization. He also spent several months at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences with Joan Bruna, focusing on multi-agent reinforcement learning.


== Early career at DeepMind ==
In late 2020, Mensch joined DeepMind Paris, where he worked for nearly three years on large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and retrieval-augmented architectures. He left in May 2023 to co-found Mistral AI.


== Founding of Mistral AI ==
In May 2023, Mensch co-founded Mistral AI with Guillaume Lample and Timothée Lacroix. The company name refers to the Mediterranean mistral wind, symbolizing speed and scale.
Mistral’s stated mission is to combine open science, efficiency, and enterprise utility, positioning itself as a European champion able to compete with U.S. tech giants.


=== Strategy ===
Open-weight models released for transparency and adoption.
Hybrid licensing: open models for research, API/proprietary models for enterprise.
Post-training customization for enterprises, sometimes embedding Mistral engineers.
Multi-cloud strategy to reduce dependency on Microsoft or others.


== Funding and growth ==
June 2023: €105m raised (Lightspeed, Xavier Niel, Eric Schmidt, others).
Dec 2023: €385m raised (a16z, BNP, Salesforce), valuation ~€2b.
Jun 2024: €600m Series B led by General Catalyst, valuation ~€5.8b.
Sep 2025: €1.7b Series C, ASML takes ~11% stake, valuation €11.7b.
By 2025, Mensch and co-founders were reported billionaires (net worth ~$1.1b each).


== Products and partnerships ==
Mistral has released multiple large language models (Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8×7B, Codestral, Mathstral, Magistral).  
Its consumer-facing chatbot Le Chat integrates news sources and enterprise connectors.


=== Partnerships ===
2024: Partnership with Microsoft Azure.
2025: €100m contract with CMA CGM.
2025: AFP deal feeding >2,000 articles/day into Le Chat.


== Public engagement and positions ==
Mensch frequently comments on:

Regulation: should target applications, not base models.
Deskilling risk: overreliance on AI may erode human expertise.
Sovereignty: advocates European compute and sovereignty in AI.
He has testified before the French Senate and is a frequent conference speaker (e.g. with Elad Gil, Jensen Huang).


== Recognition ==
Included in Time magazine’s TIME100 innovators (2024).
Appointed Knight of the National Order of Merit (15 May 2025).


== Personal life ==
Mensch keeps his private life largely confidential; some reports mention he became a father in 2024.
