== Controversy ==
At Maextro's brand technology event on 20 February 2025, a comparison test video was shown, featuring the Maextro S800 and the Mercedes-Maybach S680 in -20 °C extreme cold conditions. The video demonstrated the Maextro S800's stable performance, while the Maybach S680 experienced loss of control.
On 24 February, a user on Douyin, claiming to be the owner of the very Maybach S680 posted a video accusing Maextro of using his vehicle for "violent driving and testing" without notification or authorization, resulting in damage to the front of the car and deformation of the wheel hubs. The car owner displayed the vehicle's GPS tracking and photos of the damage, questioning Maextro's alleged concealment and demanding compensation for vehicle repair costs.
On the evening of the 25th, JAC Group issued a statement asserting that the test data was authentic and reliable, and that the test vehicle was obtained through formal third-party rental channels, with the vehicle's purpose clearly stated. JAC Group stated it expressed regret for the inconvenience caused to relevant parties and stated their willingness to actively communicate and negotiate a resolution. On the 28th, Maextro's legal department released a statement claiming that a large number of online accounts were maliciously fabricating rumors, and that evidence had been collected and reported. Maextro also issued a reward notice with a maximum of 5 million yuan, soliciting clues related to malicious smear campaigns targeting Maextro.
On 11 March, Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance's legal department announced via Sina Weibo that it had filed a lawsuit against social media influencer 我是大彬同学, accusing the influencer of exaggerating misinformation and harming the public perception of the Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance brand and its products. On March 12, Maextro's legal team stated on Weibo that it had initiated a civil lawsuit against influencer 赛车星冰乐, accusing the latter of repeatedly posting defamatory remarks about the S800 through multiple affiliated accounts and demanded 1 million yuan in compensation. Subsequently, 赛车星冰乐 announced a countersuit against Maextro for falsely claiming he operated affiliated accounts to spread malicious information, harming his reputation and causing emotional distress, and requested 2.5 million yuan in compensation.
