CHAI AI (also known as CHAI Research) is an American artificial intelligence (AI) company that operates a chatbot platform. Founded in 2021 by William Beauchamp, CHAI's chatbots use large language models (LLMs). The company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California.


== History ==
William Beauchamp began developing the initial prototype for CHAI in 2020 while in Cambridge, United Kingdom. The company launched in 2021 and relocated to Palo Alto in 2022.
CHAI was one of the first companies to deploy an LLM-based consumer chat application, initially using the open-source GPT-J model.
In July 2024 authorities in Belgium launched an investigation into the company following reports of a Dutch man dying by suicide following extensive chats on the Chai app.


== Technology ==
The CHAI allows users to create and interact with chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). These chatbots can be published to the platform for other users to interact with.
