The Open Science Award for Open Source Research Software (French: Prix science ouverte du logiciel libre de la recherche) is a French scientific award given since 2022.
The prize is part of the second National Plan for open science and rewards projects, teams and young researchers engaged in exemplary practices of management, dissemination and reuse of research data. It is awarded by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research and Space.
The prize has four categories:

The "Scientific and Technical" (Scientifique et technique) category rewards software that stands out for its scientific quality, methodological rigour and technical excellence.
The "Community" (Communauté) category highlights projects that have successfully built and nurtured an active community of users and contributors.
The "Documentation" category recognises software that offers exemplary documentation facilitating use, adoption and contribution to the project.
The "Jury's Favourite" (Coup de cœur du jury) category rewards an exemplary project combining several of these dimensions.
In each category, the jury awards a main prize as well as a "rising star" (espoir) award for promising projects, typically started less than five years ago.
