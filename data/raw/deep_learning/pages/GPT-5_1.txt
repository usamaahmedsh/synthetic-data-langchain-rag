GPT-5.1 is a family of four large language models within OpenAI's GPT series. Two were released on November 12, 2025; two more were released one week later on November 19.


== Features ==
GPT-5.1 expands beyond text with shopping research, multimodal features, and customizable personalities. Its interactive shopping tools highlight OpenAI's drive toward everyday usefulness. It offers 8 personality options, making it OpenAI's most customizable model yet. It is also faster and has a "warmer personality" by default compared to GPT-5.
GPT-5.1 is available to all users, though paid Pro, Plus, Go, and Business users were given advanced access. From GPT-5.1's release, the old GPT‑5 model will remain available as a legacy option for three months to give users time to transition.


== Models ==
The model consists of two modes: GPT-5.1 Instant and GPT-5.1 Thinking, the latter being a reasoning model designed for more complex tasks.
On November 19, 2025, OpenAI released GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, an agentic coding model which "has been internally observed to complete tasks lasting more than 24 hours, including multi-step refactors, test-driven iteration, and autonomous debugging." GPT-5.1 Pro was also released on the same day, replacing GPT-5 Pro.


== Reception ==


=== Critical reviews ===
Amanda Caswell from Tom's Guide praised GPT-5.1 for its mathematical reasoning and coding abilities, but ultimately decided that Gemini 3 produced better results overall.
Writing for TechRadar, Eric Hal Schwartz compared GPT-5.1 to GPT-5 and found the new model to be more consistent in following prompts. Though the upgrade "might be termed [an] incremental improvement" and despite GPT-5 being "still a remarkably capable model that delivers strong performance across a variety of tasks", "GPT-5.1 builds on that foundation with refinements that make it feel like a better choice for real-world uses."
