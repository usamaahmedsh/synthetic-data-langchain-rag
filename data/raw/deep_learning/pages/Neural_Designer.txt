Neural Designer is a software tool for machine learning based on neural networks, a main area of artificial intelligence research, and contains a graphical user interface which simplifies data entry and interpretation of results.
In 2015, Neural Designer was chosen by the European Commission, within the Horizon 2020 program, as a disruptive technology in the ICT field.


== Features ==
Neural Designer performs descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive data analytics. It implements deep architectures with multiple non-linear layers and contains utilities to solve function regression, pattern recognition, time series and autoencoding problems.
The input to Neural Designer is a data set, and its output is a predictive model. That result takes the form of an explicit mathematical expression, which can be exported to any computer language or system.
