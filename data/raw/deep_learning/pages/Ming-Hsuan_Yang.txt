Ming-Hsuan Yang is a computer scientist, academic, and author. He is a professor at the University of California, Merced, and a research scientist at Google DeepMind.
Yang's work is focused on computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics.
He is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).


== Education and career ==
Yang received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Yang worked as a senior research scientist at the Honda Research Institute in Mountain View, California. He joined UC Merced in 2008. Since 2018, he has been a research scientist at Google DeepMind. He previously chaired the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) and the Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV).


== Research ==
Much of Yang's research has explored intelligent systems such as AI, machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. In a paper published in 2013, Yang assessed online object tracking algorithms through large-scale experiments, identifying methods, benchmarking performance, and highlighting key factors influencing tracking accuracy across different scenarios. He also presented a graph-based manifold ranking approach for saliency detection, integrating foreground and background cues, and benchmark dataset evaluation.
Yang has been named a highly cited researcher from 2018 to 2024.
