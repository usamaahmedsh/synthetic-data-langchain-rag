Several further versions of YouChat were released. The second version, called YouChat 2.0, was released on February 7, 2023,  incorporated improved conversational AI and community-built applications by blending a large language model named C-A-L (Chat, Apps, and Links). This update enabled YouChat to provide results in various formats, such as charts, photos, videos, tables, graphs, text or code, so users can find answers without leaving the search results page.
