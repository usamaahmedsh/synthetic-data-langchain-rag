Microsoft for Startups is a global program by Microsoft that provides technology, expertise, and support for startup companies. The program's current iteration, the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, launched in 2022, provides free access to Microsoft Azure cloud services, development tools like GitHub Enterprise and Visual Studio, and productivity software such as Microsoft 365.
A key feature of the Founders Hub is its open-access model, which removed the previous requirement for startups to be backed by a venture capital firm, making it available to any founder with an idea and no external funding. The program aims to help startups overcome common barriers, such as high infrastructure costs and lack of technical mentorship.


== History ==


=== Microsoft BizSpark (2008–2018) ===
The program's origins trace back to Microsoft BizSpark, which launched in November 2008. BizSpark was created to provide early-stage software startups with free Microsoft software, developer tools, and technical support, including access to the Azure platform. The program was structured around a network of partners, including venture capitalists and incubators, who would nominate startups. In 2009, an enhanced tier called BizSpark One was introduced for high-potential startups.


=== Microsoft for Startups (2018–2022) ===
In February 2018, Microsoft discontinued BizSpark and replaced it with the first iteration of Microsoft for Startups. This program shifted focus to helping more mature startups scale by offering go-to-market resources and co-selling opportunities with Microsoft's enterprise customer base. However, it largely retained the requirement for startups to be series A or B funded.


=== Founders Hub (2022–present) ===
In March 2022, Microsoft completely overhauled the program and relaunched it as the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub. This was a significant strategic shift designed to make the program accessible to a much broader audience. The funding requirement was eliminated, allowing any founder—from those with just an idea to those with a product—to sign up directly. The new model introduced a tiered system of benefits that scale as a company grows.


== Program Structure and Offerings ==
The Founders Hub operates on a self-service platform where founders sign up and gain access to benefits tailored to their stage.


=== Core Benefits ===
Microsoft Azure Credits: The program's central offering is up to $150,000 in Azure credits. The credits scale over time based on usage, designed to support a startup through its first few years of development. Once the credits are fully consumed, the Azure subscription converts to a standard pay-as-you-go billing model. This model includes access to over 25 "Always Free" services for lightweight applications.
Developer and Productivity Tools: Members receive free access to Visual Studio Enterprise, GitHub Enterprise, Microsoft 365, and LinkedIn Premium.
Technical Features: A key benefit for web developers is the seamless deployment of applications using Azure Static Web Apps, which integrates CI/CD pipelines from GitHub and includes a global CDN and serverless APIs at no initial cost.
AI and OpenAI Access: The program provides qualifying startups with credits and access to OpenAI models, including GPT-4, through the Azure OpenAI Service.


=== Pegasus Program ===
For high-growth, market-ready startups, Microsoft offers an invitation-only tier called the Pegasus Program. This program provides dedicated support to help startups scale, including go-to-market resources and co-selling opportunities with Microsoft's enterprise sales teams.


== Comparison with Other Programs ==
Microsoft for Startups competes with several other major technology company programs that support startups:

AWS Activate: As the primary competitor, AWS Activate offers startups up to $100,000 in AWS credits, along with technical support and training. Like the Founders Hub, it has an open-access tier for unfunded startups, as well as separate tiers for those backed by venture capital.
Google for Startups Cloud Program: Google's program also provides cloud credits and technical support. However, its top tier, which offers up to $200,000 in credits, is primarily aimed at startups that have already received venture capital funding.
Nvidia Inception: This program is focused on startups working in AI and data science. It does not primarily offer cloud credits but instead provides access to GPU technology, deep learning expertise, and co-marketing support. Like the Founders Hub, it is open to startups at any stage, regardless of funding.
Meta Accelerators: Meta Platforms runs various accelerator programs, often in partnership with incubators like Plug and Play. While these programs provide deep mentorship, they are typically run in time-limited cohorts and are often geographically restricted, such as to the United States.
