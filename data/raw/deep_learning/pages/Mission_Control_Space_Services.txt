== History ==
2015 - Mission Control won its first contract with the Canadian Space Agency to develop ASAS: the Autonomous Soil Assessment System.
2018/2019 - Mission Control secured funding from the Canadian Space Agency through their Lunar Exploration Accelerator Program (LEAP) for the development of an operations and autonomy framework for upcoming lunar exploration missions. Mission Control's Spacefarer software was prepared to help guide the Rashid Lunar Rover, a component of the Emirates Lunar Mission, scheduled to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2022.
2023 - M1 of the Emirates Lunar Mission did not successfully land. Although this was upsetting for the Mission Control team, the company is now the first organization in the world to deploy deep-learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) in lunar orbit.
