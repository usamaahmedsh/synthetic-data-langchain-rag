Gu and Zheng used AI in combination with off-the-shelf cameras. Gu said to create a platform that both retrofitted and newly-built stores could use to turn automated and provide checkout-free experience for customers. Gu's company launched autonomous stores in the US, UK, France, Dubai, Poland and China with brands including Carrefour, Majid al Futtaim, Morrisons, Verizon and Zabka. 
Before founding AiFi, Gu worked on the Google Glass at Google X in Advanced R&D, Rapid Technology Evaluation, as well as a research scientist at Apple on Force Touch and haptic technology.
