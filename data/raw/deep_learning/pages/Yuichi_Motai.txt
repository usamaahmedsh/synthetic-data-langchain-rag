== Research ==
Motai's papers address fundamental and applied problems of sensory intelligence, which relate to specific application domains such as medical imaging, pattern recognition, computer vision, sensory-based robotic and biomedical applications.  The majority of his 39 papers were published in IEEE Transactions, in 1) sensory Intelligence, focused on 2) adaptive prediction and 3) online classification methodologies:

Sensory Intelligence: Fundamentals of robotic vision and data-intensive computing.
Adaptive Prediction: Kalman filter bank, Optimized prediction, Time sequences signals.
Online Classification: Kernel feature analysis, Neural networks, Deep learning.
Radiation Oncology: Medical imaging, 4D Cone beam computed tomography, 4D MRI.
Radiology: Computer-Aided Diagnosis, Distributed Database Network, Virtual colonoscopy.
Specific applications such as Radiation Oncology and Radiology were chosen based on his collaborator's expertise.
