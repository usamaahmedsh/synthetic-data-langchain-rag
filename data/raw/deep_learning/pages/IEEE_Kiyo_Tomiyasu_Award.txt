The IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award is a Technical Field Award established by the IEEE Board of Directors in 2001. It is an institute level award, not a society level award. It is presented for outstanding early to mid-career contributions to technologies holding the promise of innovative applications. The prize is sponsored by Dr. Kiyo Tomiyasu, the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society, and the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT).
This award may be presented to an individual, multiple recipients or team of up to three people. Candidates must have graduated within the last fifteen years and must be no more than forty-five years old when nominated. Recipients of this award receive a bronze medal, certificate, and honorarium.
