== Controversies ==
In October 2013, two female students were suspended after they helped organize an online opinion survey of female VIT students, focusing on issues of safety and inequality. Commenting on the issue, VIT vice president Sekar Viswanathan said: "The students started a campaign based on the misplaced notion that the university discriminates against women, which is false. They were taken home by their parents". An American professor who was working at the institute at the time was reportedly fired for supporting the two dismissed students via a Change.org petition. Reports citing students, rules require male and female students at VIT to live in strictly segregated facilities, in addition to imposing restrictions upon the women that the men are not burdened by."
In March 2024, VIT organized an athletic event to promote gender equality. However, there was a social media outrage because the college initially asked men to run 10 kilometers and women to run 5 kilometers. The event poster was later redesigned.
