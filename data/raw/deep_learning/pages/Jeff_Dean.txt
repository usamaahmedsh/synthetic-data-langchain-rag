Jeffrey Adgate Dean (born July 23, 1968) is an American computer scientist and software engineer. Since 2018, he has been the lead of Google AI. He was appointed Google's chief scientist in 2023 after the merger of DeepMind and Google Brain into Google DeepMind.


== Early life and education ==
Jeff Dean was born to a family of a tropical disease researcher and a medical anthropologist, who moved the family frequently. However, from the fifth to tenth grade, Dean attended schools in the Twin Cities.
Dean received a B.S., summa cum laude, from the University of Minnesota in computer science and economics in 1990. His undergraduate thesis was on neural networks in C programming, advised by Vipin Kumar. During freshman year, Dean met his future wife, Heidi Hopper, who graduated from the same university in 1990.
He received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Washington in 1996, working under Craig Chambers on compilers and whole-program optimization techniques for object-oriented programming languages.


== Career ==


=== Early career ===
Before graduate school, Dean worked at the World Health Organization's Global Programme on AIDS, developing software for statistical modeling and forecasting of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
After graduate school, Dean worked at DEC/Compaq's Western Research Laboratory, on profiling tools, microprocessor architecture and information retrieval. Much of his work was completed in close collaboration with Sanjay Ghemawat. In early 1999 he briefly worked at comparison-shopping startup mySimon as a senior member of technical staff, designing and implementing a distributed system for web crawling, caching, and full-text indexing of product information to improve the scalability of its shopping search service, before leaving later that year to join Google.


=== Career at Google ===
Dean joined Google in mid-1999. He was Google's 30th employee. As of 2018, Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat are the only two employees at Google to hold the title of Senior Fellow, the highest technical level at the company. 


==== Systems design ====
Dean designed and implemented large portions of Google's advertising, crawling, indexing and query serving systems, along with various pieces of the distributed computing infrastructure that underlies most of Google's products. At various times, he has also worked on improving search quality, statistical machine translation  (Google translate) and internal software development tools and has had significant involvement in the engineering hiring process.
Company systems Dean has worked on with Sanjay Ghemawat include:

Original design of Protocol Buffers, an open-source data interchange format
Spanner, a scalable, multi-version, globally distributed, and synchronously replicated database
Bigtable, a large-scale semi-structured storage system
MapReduce, a system for large-scale data processing applications
LevelDB, an open-source on-disk key-value store


==== Artificial intelligence ====
Dean joined Google X in 2011 to investigate deep neural networks, which had just resurged in popularity. This ended with "the cat neuron paper", a deep belief network trained by unsupervised learning on YouTube videos. This project morphed into Google Brain,  a team that studies large-scale artificial neural networks, also formed in 2011. Jeff Dean became its leader in 2012. 
Dean worked on DistBelief, a proprietary machine-learning system for distributed training of deep neural networks, whose name reflects the possibility to train deep belief networks.​ DistBelief was eventually refactored into TensorFlow, an open-source machine-learning software library, for which he was among the designers and implementers of the initial release.​ The DistBelief system was used to train the network in "the cat neuron paper". TensorFlow initially dominated the machine-learning research landscape, but 
by 2023 accounted for only 8% of exclusive models on Hugging Face compared to 92% for PyTorch, which was also used in 80% of academic papers utilizing deep learning frameworks. 
Dean also worked on Pathways, an asynchronous distributed dataflow system for neural networks. It was used in PaLM.

In April 2018, Dean was appointed the head of Google's artificial intelligence division, after John Giannandrea left to lead Apple's AI projects.
In December 2020, Google’s Ethical AI team co-lead Timnit Gebru and the company disagreed over a draft paper she co-authored on the risks and ethical implications of large language models. Google declined to reopen the review or share reviewer identities, and Gebru’s employment subsequently ended under terms both parties described as a resignation. In the aftermath, Dean canceled a scheduled AI ethics team all-hands meeting and acknowledged that the episode had “surfaced large, important issues” around research culture, bias, and inclusion within Google’s AI organization. In an open letter, critics demanded that members of Google's senior leadership, including Dean, "explain the process by which the paper was unilaterally rejected by leadership." Google's CEO subsequently issued an apology. In February 2021, Google fired Margaret Mitchell, the other co‑lead and founder of the Ethical AI team. Mitchell had publicly criticized the company’s handling of Gebru’s exit, while Google said she violated its code of conduct. Media coverage described both departures as damaging to Google’s reputation in the AI research community and to Dean’s leadership of the division.
In 2023, DeepMind was merged with Google Brain to form a unified AI research unit, Google DeepMind, headed by Demis Hassabis. As part of this reorganization, Dean became Google's chief scientist. Dean proposed the name Gemini for the chatbot developed by Google DeepMind, "because it's like twins coming together".


=== Beyond Google ===
In 2025, Dean joined the board of Laude Institute, steering the organization with David Patterson, Joelle Pineau, and Andy Konwinski.


== Philanthropy ==
Dean and his wife, Heidi Hopper, started the Hopper-Dean Foundation and began making philanthropic grants in 2011. In 2016, the foundation gave $2 million each to UC Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Washington, Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University to support programs that promote diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The Menlo Park-based foundation gave $22.1 million to a variety of universities and non-profits in 2023 and ended the year with $54.4 million in assets, according to its Form 990.


== Awards and honors ==
Dean was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2009, which recognized his work on "the science and engineering of large-scale distributed computer systems".
Additional awards

Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (2009)
ACM-Infosys Foundation Award (2012)
ACM SIGOPS Mark Weiser Award (2007)
Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2016)
Recipient of the IEEE John von Neumann Medal in 2021

== Personal life ==
Dean is married and has two daughters.

He is the subject of an Internet meme for "Jeff Dean facts". Similar to Chuck Norris facts, the Jeff Dean facts exaggerate his programming powers. For example:Once, in early 2002, when the index servers went down, Jeff Dean answered user queries manually for two hours. Evals showed a quality improvement of 5 points.


=== Interviews ===
Dean was interviewed for the 2018 book Architects of Intelligence: The Truth About AI from the People Building it by the American futurist Martin Ford.
