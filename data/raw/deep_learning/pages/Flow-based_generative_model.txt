A flow-based generative model is a generative model used in machine learning that explicitly models a probability distribution by leveraging normalizing flow, which is a statistical method using the change-of-variable law of probabilities to transform a simple distribution into a complex one.
The direct modeling of likelihood provides many advantages. For example, the negative log-likelihood can be directly computed and minimized as the loss function. Additionally, novel samples can be generated by sampling from the initial distribution, and applying the flow transformation.
In contrast, many alternative generative modeling methods such as variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network do not explicitly represent the likelihood function.

Learning probability distributions by differentiating such log Jacobians originated in the Infomax (maximum likelihood) approach to ICA, which forms a single-layer (K=1) flow-based model. Relatedly, the single layer precursor of conditional generative flows appeared in.
To efficiently compute the log likelihood, the functions 
  
    
      
        
          f

    {\displaystyle f_{1},...,f_{K}}
  
 should be easily invertible, and the determinants of their Jacobians should be simple to compute. In practice, the functions 
  
    
      
        
          f

    {\displaystyle f_{1},...,f_{K}}
  
 are modeled using deep neural networks, and are trained to minimize the negative log-likelihood of data samples from the target distribution. These architectures are usually designed such that only the forward pass of the neural network is required in both the inverse and the Jacobian determinant calculations. Examples of such architectures include NICE, RealNVP, and Glow.

== Training method ==
As is generally done when training a deep learning model, the goal with normalizing flows is to minimize the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the model's likelihood and the target distribution to be estimated. Denoting 
  
    
      
        
          p

 the target distribution to learn, the (forward) KL-divergence is:

The second term on the right-hand side of the equation corresponds to the entropy of the target distribution and is independent of the parameter 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  
 we want the model to learn, which only leaves the expectation of the negative log-likelihood to minimize under the target distribution. This intractable term can be approximated with a Monte-Carlo method by importance sampling. Indeed, if we have a dataset 
  
    
      
        {
        
          x
          
            i

            i
            =
            1
          
          
            N
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}}
  
 of samples each independently drawn from the target distribution 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p^{*}(x)}
  
, then this term can be estimated as:

In other words, minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the model's likelihood and the target distribution is equivalent to maximizing the model likelihood under observed samples of the target distribution.

 has no closed-form solution in general.
The Jacobian is

For it to be invertible everywhere, it must be nonzero everywhere. For example, 
  
    
      
        h
        =
        tanh
      
    
    {\displaystyle h=\tanh }
  
 and 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        u
        ,
        w
        ⟩
        >
        −
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle u,w\rangle >-1}
  
 satisfies the requirement.

The autoregressive model is recovered by setting 
  
    
      
        z
        ∼
        N
        (
        0
        ,
        
          I
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle z\sim N(0,I_{n})}
  
.
The forward mapping is slow (because it's sequential), but the backward mapping is fast (because it's parallel).
The Jacobian matrix is lower-diagonal, so the Jacobian is 
  
    
      
        
          σ

        )
        ⋯

            :
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{1}\sigma _{2}(x_{1})\cdots \sigma _{n}(x_{1:n-1})}
  
.
Reversing the two maps 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            θ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\theta }}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            θ

            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\theta }^{-1}}
  
 of MAF results in Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF), which has fast forward mapping and slow backward mapping.


=== Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) ===
Instead of constructing flow by function composition, another approach is to formulate the flow as a continuous-time dynamic. Let 
  
    
      
        
          z
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z_{0}}
  
 be the latent variable with distribution 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        
          z
          
            0
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(z_{0})}
  
. Map this latent variable to data space with the following flow function:

  
    
      
        x
        =
        F
        (
        
          z
          
            0
          
        
        )
        =
        
          z
          
            T
          
        
        =
        
          z
          
            0
          
        
        +
        
          ∫
          
            0
          
          
            T
          
        
        f
        (
        
          z
          
            t
          
        
        ,
        t
        )
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=F(z_{0})=z_{T}=z_{0}+\int _{0}^{T}f(z_{t},t)dt}
  

where 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 is an arbitrary function and can be modeled with e.g. neural networks.
The inverse function is then naturally:

  
    
      
        
          z
          
            0
          
        
        =
        
          F
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          z
          
            T
          
        
        +
        
          ∫
          
            T
          
          
            0
          
        
        f
        (
        
          z
          
            t
          
        
        ,
        t
        )
        d
        t
        =
        
          z
          
            T
          
        
        −
        
          ∫
          
            0
          
          
            T
          
        
        f
        (
        
          z
          
            t
          
        
        ,
        t
        )
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle z_{0}=F^{-1}(x)=z_{T}+\int _{T}^{0}f(z_{t},t)dt=z_{T}-\int _{0}^{T}f(z_{t},t)dt}
  

And the log-likelihood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
 can be found as:

  
    
      
        log
        ⁡
        (
        p
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        log
        ⁡
        (
        p
        (
        
          z
          
            0
          
        
        )
        )
        −
        
          ∫
          
            0
          
          
            T
          
        
        
          Tr
        
        
          [
          
            
              
                ∂
                f
              
              
                ∂
                
                  z
                  
                    t
                  
                
              
            
          
          ]
        
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle \log(p(x))=\log(p(z_{0}))-\int _{0}^{T}{\text{Tr}}\left[{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z_{t}}}\right]dt}
  

Since the trace depends only on the diagonal of the Jacobian 
  
    
      
        
          ∂
          
            
              z
              
                t
              
            
          
        
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle \partial _{z_{t}}f}
  
, this allows "free-form" Jacobian. Here, "free-form" means that there is no restriction on the Jacobian's form. It is contrasted with previous discrete models of normalizing flow, where the Jacobian is carefully designed to be only upper- or lower-diagonal, so that the Jacobian can be evaluated efficiently.

The trace can be estimated by "Hutchinson's trick":Given any matrix 
  
    
      
        W
        ∈

    {\displaystyle u\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}

        E

        ]
        =
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle E[uu^{T}]=I}
  
, we have 
  
    
      
        E
        [
        
          u

    {\displaystyle E[u^{T}Wu]=tr(W)}
  
. (Proof: expand the expectation directly.)Usually, the random vector is sampled from 
  
    
      
        N
        (
        0
        ,

When 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 is implemented as a neural network, neural ODE methods would be needed. Indeed, CNF was first proposed in the same paper that proposed neural ODE.
There are two main deficiencies of CNF, one is that a continuous flow must be a homeomorphism, thus preserve orientation and ambient isotopy (for example, it's impossible to flip a left-hand to a right-hand by continuous deforming of space, and it's impossible to turn a sphere inside out, or undo a knot), and the other is that the learned flow 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 might be ill-behaved, due to degeneracy (that is, there are an infinite number of possible 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 that all solve the same problem).
By adding extra dimensions, the CNF gains enough freedom to reverse orientation and go beyond ambient isotopy (just like how one can pick up a polygon from a desk and flip it around in 3-space, or unknot a knot in 4-space), yielding the "augmented neural ODE".
Any homeomorphism of 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
  
 can be approximated by a neural ODE operating on 
  
    
      
        
          
            R

            n

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2n+1}}
  
, proved by combining Whitney embedding theorem for manifolds and the universal approximation theorem for neural networks.

, one can impose regularization losses. The paper  proposed the following regularization loss based on optimal transport theory:
  
    
      
        
          λ

 are hyperparameters. The first term punishes the model for oscillating the flow field over time, and the second term punishes it for oscillating the flow field over space. Both terms together guide the model into a flow that is smooth (not "bumpy") over space and time.

where volume (for very small regions) is given by Lebesgue measure in 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  
-dimensional tangent space. By making the regions infinitessimally small, the factor relating the two densities is the ratio of volumes, which we term the differential volume ratio.
To obtain concrete formulas for volume on the 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  
-dimensional manifold, we construct 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
  
 by mapping an 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  
-dimensional rectangle in (local) coordinate space to the manifold via a smooth embedding function: 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            m
          
        
        →

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
  
. At very small scale, the embedding function becomes essentially linear so that 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
  
 is a parallelotope (multidimensional generalization of a parallelogram). Similarly, the flow transform, 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 becomes linear, so that the image, 
  
    
      
        V
        =
        f
        (
        U
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle V=f(U)}
  
 is also a parallelotope. In 
  
    
      
        
          
            R

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}}
  
, we can represent an 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  
-dimensional parallelotope with an 
  
    
      
        m

    {\displaystyle m{\text{-by-}}m}
  
 matrix whose column-vectors are a set of edges (meeting at a common vertex) that span the paralellotope. The volume is given by the absolute value of the determinant of this matrix. If more generally (as is the case here), an 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  
-dimensional paralellotope is embedded in 
  
    
      
        
          
            R

    {\displaystyle n{\text{-by-}}m}
  
 matrix, say 
  
    
      
        
          V
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {V} }
  
. Denoting the parallelotope as 
  
    
      
        
          /
        
        
          V
        
        
        
          /
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle /\mathbf {V} \!/}
  
, its volume is then given by the square root of the Gram determinant: 

  
    
      
        volume
        ⁡
        
          /

                ⁡
                (
                
                  
                    V
                  
                  ′

    {\displaystyle \operatorname {volume} /\mathbf {V} \!/={\sqrt {\left|\operatorname {det} (\mathbf {V} '\mathbf {V} )\right|}}}
  

In the sections below, we show various ways to use this volume formula to derive the differential volume ratio.

    {\displaystyle \left|\operatorname {det} \mathbf {D} )\right|}
  
 cancels in the volume ratio, which can now already be numerically evaluated. It can however be rewritten in a sometimes more convenient form by also introducing the representation function, 
  
    
      
        r
        :
        
          p
        
        ↦
        
          
            
              
                p
              
              ~
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r:\mathbf {p} \mapsto {\tilde {\mathbf {p} }}}
  
, which simply extracts the first 
  
    
      
        (
        n
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (n-1)}
  
 components. The Jacobian is 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
        =
        
          
            [
            
              
                
                  
                    
                      I
                    
                    
                      n
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    0

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ={\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf {I} _{n}&{\boldsymbol {0}}\end{bmatrix}}}
  
. Observe that, since 
  
    
      
        e
        ∘
        r
        ∘
        f
        =
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle e\circ r\circ f=f}
  
, the chain rule for function composition gives: 
  
    
      
        
          E
          R
          
            F
            
              p
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            F
            
              p
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {ERF_{p}} =\mathbf {F_{p}} }
  
. By plugging this expansion into the above Gram determinant and then refactoring it as a product of determinants of square matrices, we can extract the factor 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              |

                (
                
                  
                    E
                  
                  ′
                
                
                  E
                
                )
              
              |
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\left|\operatorname {det} (\mathbf {E} '\mathbf {E} )\right|}}={\sqrt {n}}}
  
, which now also cancels in the ratio, which finally simpifies to the determinant of the Jacobian of the "sandwiched" flow transformation,

        ∘
        f
        ∘

This formula is valid only because the simplex is flat and the Jacobian, 
  
    
      
        
          E
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} }
  
 is constant. The more general case for curved manifolds is discussed below, after we present two concrete examples of simplex flow transforms.

        ⟺

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} =f_{\text{cal}}(\mathbf {p} ;a,\mathbf {c} )=\operatorname {softmax} (a^{-1}\log \mathbf {p} +\mathbf {c} )\;\iff \;\mathbf {p} =f_{\text{cal}}^{-1}(\mathbf {q} ;a,\mathbf {c} )=\operatorname {softmax} (a\log \mathbf {q} -a\mathbf {c} )}
  

where the log is applied elementwise. After some algebra the differential volume ratio can be expressed as:

  
    
      
        
          R
          
            cal

        (
        
          p
        
        ;
        a
        ,
        
          c
        
        )
        =
        
          |
          
            det
            ⁡
            (
            
              R
              
                F
                
                  p
                
              
              E
            
            )
          
          |
        
        =
        
          
            |
            a
            |
          
          
            1
            −
            n
          
        
        
          ∏
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          
            
              q
              
                i
              
            
            
              p
              
                i
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{\text{cal}}^{\Delta }(\mathbf {p} ;a,\mathbf {c} )=\left|\operatorname {det} (\mathbf {RF_{p}E} )\right|=\left|a\right|^{1-n}\prod _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {q_{i}}{p_{i}}}}
  

This result can also be obtained by factoring the density of the SGB distribution, which is obtained by sending Dirichlet variates through 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            cal
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\text{cal}}}
  
.
While calibration transforms are most often trained as discriminative models, the reinterpretation here as a probabilistic flow allows also the design of generative calibration models based on this transform. When used for calibration, the restriction 
  
    
      
        a
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle a>0}
  
 can be imposed to prevent direction reversal in log-probability space. With the additional restriction 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        =
        
          0
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} ={\boldsymbol {0}}}
  
, this transform (with discriminative training) is known in machine learning as temperature scaling.

In fact, the set of 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            gcal
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\text{gcal}}}
  
 transformations form a group under function composition. The set of 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            cal
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\text{cal}}}
  
 transformations form a subgroup.
Also see: Dirichlet calibration, which generalizes 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            gcal
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\text{gcal}}}
  
, by not placing any restriction on the matrix, 
  
    
      
        
          A
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }
  
, so that invertibility is not guaranteed. While Dirichlet calibration is trained as a discriminative model, 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            gcal
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\text{gcal}}}
  
 can also be trained as part of a generative calibration model.


=== Differential volume ratio for curved manifolds ===
Consider a flow, 
  
    
      
        
          y
        
        =
        f
        (
        
          x
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} =f(\mathbf {x} )}
  
 on a curved manifold, for example 
  
    
      
        
          
            S
          
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{n-1}}
  
 which we equip with the embedding function, 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
  
 that maps a set of 
  
    
      
        (
        n
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (n-1)}
  
 angular spherical coordinates to 
  
    
      
        
          
            S
          
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{n-1}}
  
. The Jacobian of 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
  
 is non-constant and we have to evaluate it at both input (
  
    
      
        
          
            E
            
              x
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {E_{x}} }
  
) and output (
  
    
      
        
          
            E
            
              y
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {E_{y}} }
  
). The same applies to 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  
, the representation function that recovers spherical coordinates from points on 
  
    
      
        
          
            S
          
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{n-1}}
  
, for which we need the Jacobian at the output (
  
    
      
        
          
            R
            
              y
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {R_{y}} }
  
). The differential volume ratio now generalizes to:

            S

, where the spherical coordinates are co-latitude, 
  
    
      
        θ
        ∈
        [
        0
        ,
        π
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta \in [0,\pi ]}
  
 and longitude, 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        ∈
        [
        0
        ,

. At 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
        =
        e
        (
        θ

        ϕ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =e(\theta ,\phi )}
  
, we get 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              |
              
                det
                ⁡
                (
                
                  
                    E

                )
              
              |

, which gives the radius of the circle at that latitude (compare e.g. polar circle to equator). The differential volume (surface area on the sphere) is: 
  
    
      
        sin
        ⁡
        θ

    {\displaystyle \sin \theta \,d\theta \,d\phi }
  
.
The above derivation for 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{f}}
  
 is fragile in the sense that when using fixed functions 
  
    
      
        e
        ,
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle e,r}
  
, there may be places where they are not well-defined, for example at the poles of the 2-sphere where longitude is arbitrary. This problem is sidestepped (using standard manifold machinery) by generalizing to local coordinates (charts), where in the vicinities of 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
        ,
        
          y
        
        ∈
        
          
            M
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \in {\mathcal {M}}}
  
, we map  from local 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  
-dimensional coordinates to 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
  
 and back using the respective function pairs 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            
              x
            
          
        
        ,
        
          r
          
            
              x
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{\mathbf {x} },r_{\mathbf {x} }}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            
              y
            
          
        
        ,
        
          r
          
            
              y
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{\mathbf {y} },r_{\mathbf {y} }}
  
. We continue to use the same notation for the Jacobians of these functions (
  
    
      
        
          
            E
            
              x
            
          
        
        ,
        
          
            E
            
              y
            
          
        
        ,
        
          
            R
            
              y
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {E_{x}} ,\mathbf {E_{y}} ,\mathbf {R_{y}} }
  
), so that the above formula for 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{f}}
  
 remains valid.
We can however, choose our local coordinate system in a way that simplifies the expression for 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{f}}
  
 and indeed also its practical implementation. Let 
  
    
      
        π
        :
        
          
            P

        =
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi \circ \pi =\pi }
  
) from the projectible set, 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
        
        ⊆

==== Practical implementation ====
For learning the parameters of a manifold flow transformation, we need access to the differential volume ratio, 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{f}}
  
, or at least to its gradient w.r.t. the parameters. Moreover, for some inference tasks, we need access to 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{f}}
  
 itself. Practical solutions include:

Sorrenson et al.(2023) give a solution for computationally efficient stochastic parameter gradient approximation for 
  
    
      
        log
        ⁡
        
          R

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \log R_{f}.}
  

For some hand-designed flow transforms, 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{f}}
  
 can be analytically derived in closed form, for example the above-mentioned simplex calibration transforms. Further examples are given below in the section on simple spherical flows.

                    y

    {\displaystyle R_{f}(\mathbf {x} )=\left|\operatorname {det} (\mathbf {T_{y}} '\mathbf {F_{x}T_{x}} )\right|}
  
 can be automatically evaluated, given access to only 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
        ,
        f
        ,
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ,f,\pi }
  
. But this is expensive for high-dimensional data, with at least 
  
    
      
        
          
            O

          n
          
            3
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(n^{3})}
  
 computational costs. Even then, the slow automatic solution can be invaluable as a tool for numerically verifying hand-designed closed-form solutions.


=== Simple spherical flows ===
In machine learning literature, various complex spherical flows formed by deep neural network architectures may be found. In contrast, this section compiles from statistics literature the details of three very simple spherical flow transforms, with simple closed-form expressions for inverses and differential volume ratios. These flows can be used individually, or chained, to generalize distributions on the unitsphere, 
  
    
      
        
          
            S
          
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{n-1}}
  
. All three flows are compositions of an invertible affine transform in 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
  
, followed by radial projection back onto the sphere. The flavours we consider for the affine transform are: pure translation, pure linear and general affine. To make these flows fully functional for learning, inference and sampling, the tasks are:

To derive the inverse transform, with suitable restrictions on the parameters to ensure invertibility.
To derive in simple closed form the differential volume ratio, 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{f}}
  
.
An interesting property of these simple spherical flows is that they don't make use of any non-linearities apart from the radial projection. Even the simplest of them, the normalized translation flow, can be chained to form perhaps surprisingly flexible distributions.

The inverse function may be derived by considering, for

 and then using

from which we see that we need

 to keep 
  
    
      
        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
  
 real and positive for all 
  
    
      
        
          y
        
        ∈
        
          
            S

            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} \in \mathbb {S} ^{n-1}}
  
. The differential volume ratio is given (without derivation) by Boulerice & Ducharme(1994) as:

  
    
      
        
          R
          
            trans
          
        
        (
        
          x
        
        ;
        
          c
        
        )
        =
        
          
            
              1
              +
              
                
                  x
                
                ′
              
              
                c
              
            
            
              ‖
              
                x
              
              +
              
                c
              
              
                ‖
                
                  n
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{\text{trans}}(\mathbf {x} ;\mathbf {c} )={\frac {1+\mathbf {x} '\mathbf {c} }{\lVert \mathbf {x} +\mathbf {c} \rVert ^{n}}}}
  

This can indeed be verified analytically:

By a laborious manipulation of 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            f
          
        
        (
        
          x
        
        )
        =
        
          |
          
            det
            ⁡
            (
            
              
                
                  T
                  
                    y
                  
                
              
              ′
            
            
              
                F
                
                  x
                
              
              
                T
                
                  x
                
              
            
            )
          
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{f}(\mathbf {x} )=\left|\operatorname {det} (\mathbf {T_{y}} '\mathbf {F_{x}T_{x}} )\right|}
  
.
By setting 
  
    
      
        
          M
        
        =
        
          
            I
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {M} =\mathbf {I} _{n}}
  
 in 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            aff
          
        
        (
        
          x
        
        ;
        
          M
        
        ,
        
          c
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{\text{aff}}(\mathbf {x} ;\mathbf {M} ,\mathbf {c} )}
  
, which is given below.
Finally, it is worth noting that 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            trans
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\text{trans}}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            trans
          
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\text{trans}}^{-1}}
  
 do not have the same functional form.

This result can be derived indirectly via the Angular central Gaussian distribution (ACG), which can be obtained via normalized linear transform of either Gaussian, or uniform spherical variates. The first relationship can be used to derive the ACG density by a marginalization integral over the radius; after which the second relationship can be used to factor out the differential volume ratio. For details, see ACG distribution.

== Downsides ==
Despite normalizing flows success in estimating high-dimensional densities, some downsides still exist in their designs. First of all, their latent space where input data is projected onto is not a lower-dimensional space and therefore, flow-based models do not allow for compression of data by default and require a lot of computation. However, it is still possible to perform image compression with them.
Flow-based models are also notorious for failing in estimating the likelihood of out-of-distribution samples (i.e.: samples that were not drawn from the same distribution as the training set). Some hypotheses were formulated to explain this phenomenon, among which the typical set hypothesis, estimation issues when training models, or fundamental issues due to the entropy of the data distributions.
One of the most interesting properties of normalizing flows is the invertibility of their learned bijective map. This property is given by constraints in the design of the models (cf.: RealNVP, Glow) which guarantee theoretical invertibility. The integrity of the inverse is important in order to ensure the applicability of the change-of-variable theorem, the computation of the Jacobian of the map as well as sampling with the model. However, in practice this invertibility is violated and the inverse map explodes because of numerical imprecision.


== Applications ==
Flow-based generative models have been applied on a variety of modeling tasks, including:

Audio generation
Image generation
Molecular graph generation
Point-cloud modeling
Video generation
Lossy image compression
Anomaly detection
