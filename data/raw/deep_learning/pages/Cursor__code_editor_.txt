Cursor uses large language models to manipulate text with autocomplete and chat query function. It is a fork of Visual Studio Code. 
Several media outlets have described Cursor as a vibe coding app.
Cursor allows developers to write code using natural language instructions. Users can generate or update parts of their code by providing prompts. It can also index the codebase, which can be queried in natural language. The editor offers "smart rewrite" capabilities, allowing users to change multiple lines of code simultaneously. The editor attempts to predict subsequent code edits and user can jump and apply them using tabs. 
Cursor offers a "Privacy Mode" where the user's code is not stored remotely.
In April 2025, Cursor experienced a bug preventing the use of the software on multiple devices at once. A Cursor customer support email using AI-generated responses falsely cited a policy prohibiting a single subscription license from being used on multiple devices for security reasons, and falsely stated that a separate subscription had to be purchased for each device. Amid criticism of the new "policy" on Reddit, an Anysphere spokesperson issued a retraction clarifying that no such policy existed, and that it was an erroneous response from a "front-line AI support bot".
