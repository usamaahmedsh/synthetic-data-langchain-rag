Balanced ternary is a ternary numeral system (i.e. base 3 with three digits) that uses a balanced signed-digit representation of the integers in which the digits have the values −1, 0, and 1. This stands in contrast to the standard (unbalanced) ternary system, in which digits have values 0, 1 and 2. 
The balanced ternary system can represent all integers without using a separate minus sign; the value of the leading non-zero digit of a number has the sign of the number itself. The balanced ternary system is an example of a non-standard positional numeral system. It was used in some early computers and has also been used to solve balance puzzles.
Different sources use different glyphs to represent the three digits in balanced ternary. In this article, T (which resembles a ligature of the minus sign and 1) represents −1, while 0 and 1 represent themselves. Other conventions include using '−' and '+' to represent −1 and 1 respectively, or using Greek letter theta (Θ), which resembles a minus sign in a circle, to represent −1. In publications about the Setun computer, −1 is represented as overturned 1: "1".
Balanced ternary makes an early appearance in Michael Stifel's book Arithmetica Integra (1544). It also occurs in the works of Johannes Kepler and Léon Lalanne. Related signed-digit schemes in other bases have been discussed by John Colson, John Leslie, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and possibly even the ancient Indian Vedas.

where the right hand sides are integers with their usual values. This function, 
  
    
      
        
          f
          

          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{},}
  
 is what rigorously and formally establishes how integer values are assigned to the symbols/glyphs in 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              D
            
          
          
            3
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}_{3}.}
  
 One benefit of this formalism is that the definition of "the integers" (however they may be defined) is not conflated with any particular system for writing/representing them; in this way, these two distinct (albeit closely related) concepts are kept separate.
The set 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              D
            
          
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}_{3}}
  
 together with the function 
  
    
      
        
          f
          

          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{}}
  
 forms a balanced signed-digit representation called the balanced ternary system. 
It can be used to represent integers and real numbers.

which shows that 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
  
 satisfies a sort of recurrence relation. This recurrence relation has the initial condition

  
    
      
        v
        
          (
          ε
          )
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle v\left(\varepsilon \right)=0}
  
 
where 
  
    
      
        ε
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon }
  
 is the empty string.
This implies that for every string 
  
    
      
        
          d
          
            n

            +
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d_{n}\ldots d_{0}\in {\mathcal {D}}_{3}^{+},}
  

  
    
      
        v

            …
            
              d
              
                0
              
            
          
          )
        
        =
        v
        
          (

              d
              
                0

    {\displaystyle v\left(0d_{n}\ldots d_{0}\right)=v\left(d_{n}\ldots d_{0}\right)}
  

which in words says that leading 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
  
 symbols (to the left in a string with 2 or more symbols) do not affect the resulting value.
The following examples illustrate how some values of 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
  
 can be computed, where (as before) all integer are written in decimal (base 10) and all elements of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              D

            +
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}_{3}^{+}}

== Conversions to/from other representations ==


=== Conversion to decimal ===
In the balanced ternary system the value of a digit n places left of the radix point is the product of the digit and 3n. This is useful when converting between decimal and balanced ternary. In the following the strings denoting balanced ternary carry the suffix, bal3. For instance,

10bal3 = 1 × 31 + 0 × 30 = 3dec
10𝖳bal3 = 1 × 32 + 0 × 31 + (−1) × 30 = 8dec
−9dec = −1 × 32 + 0 × 31 + 0 × 30 = 𝖳00bal3
8dec = 1 × 32 + 0 × 31 + (−1) × 30 = 10𝖳bal3
Similarly, the first place to the right of the radix point holds 3−1 = ⁠1/3⁠, the second place holds 3−2 = ⁠1/9⁠, and so on. For instance,

−⁠2/3⁠dec = −1 + ⁠1/3⁠ = −1 × 30 + 1 × 3−1 = 𝖳.1bal3.

An integer is divisible by three if and only if the digit in the units place is zero.
We may check the parity of a balanced ternary integer by checking the parity of the sum of all trits. This sum has the same parity as the integer itself.
Balanced ternary can also be extended to fractional numbers similar to how decimal numbers are written to the right of the radix point.

In decimal or binary, integer values and terminating fractions have multiple representations. For example, ⁠1/10⁠ = 0.1 = 0.10 = 0.09. And, ⁠1/2⁠ = 0.12 = 0.102 = 0.012. Some balanced ternary fractions have multiple representations too. For example, ⁠1/6⁠ = 0.1𝖳bal3 = 0.01bal3. Certainly, in the decimal and binary, we may omit the rightmost trailing infinite 0s after the radix point and gain a representations of integer or terminating fraction. But, in balanced ternary, we can't omit the rightmost trailing infinite −1s after the radix point in order to gain a representations of integer or terminating fraction.
Donald Knuth has pointed out that truncation and rounding are the same operation in balanced ternary—they produce exactly the same result (a property shared with other balanced numeral systems). The number ⁠1/2⁠ is not exceptional; it has two equally valid representations, and two equally valid truncations: 0.1 (round to 0, and truncate to 0) and 1.𝖳 (round to 1, and truncate to 1). With an odd radix, double rounding is also equivalent to directly rounding to the final precision, unlike with an even radix.
The basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—are done as in regular ternary. Multiplication by two can be done by adding a number to itself, or subtracting itself after a-trit-left-shifting.
An arithmetic shift left of a balanced ternary number is the equivalent of multiplication by a (positive, integral) power of 3; and an arithmetic shift right of a balanced ternary number is the equivalent of division by a (positive, integral) power of 3.


=== Conversion to and from a fraction ===

The conversion of a repeating balanced ternary number to a fraction is analogous to converting a repeating decimal. For example (because of 111111bal3 = (⁠36 − 1/3 − 1⁠)dec):

=== Conversion from unbalanced ternary ===
Unbalanced ternary can be converted to balanced ternary notation in two ways: 

Add 1 trit-by-trit from the first non-zero trit with carry, and then subtract 1 trit-by-trit from the same trit without borrow. For example,
0213 + 113 = 1023, 1023 − 113 = 1T1bal3 = 7dec.
If a 2 is present in ternary, turn it into 1T. For example,
02123 = 0010bal3 + 1T00bal3 + 001Tbal3 = 10TTbal3 = 23dec

If the three values of ternary logic are false, unknown and true, and these are mapped to balanced ternary as T, 0 and 1 and to conventional unsigned ternary values as 0, 1 and 2, then balanced ternary can be viewed as a biased number system analogous to the offset binary system.
If the ternary number has n trits, then the bias b is

  
    
      
        b
        =
        
          ⌊
          
            
              
                3
                
                  n
                
              
              2
            
          
          ⌋
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle b=\left\lfloor {\frac {3^{n}}{2}}\right\rfloor }
  

which is represented as all ones in either conventional or biased form.
As a result, if these two representations are used for balanced and unsigned ternary numbers, an unsigned n-trit positive ternary value can be converted to balanced form by adding the bias b and a positive balanced number can be converted to unsigned form by subtracting the bias b.  Furthermore, if x and y are balanced numbers, their balanced sum is x + y − b when computed using conventional unsigned ternary arithmetic. Similarly, if x and y are conventional unsigned ternary numbers, their sum is x + y + b when computed using balanced ternary arithmetic.


=== Conversion from any integer base to balanced ternary ===
We may convert to balanced ternary with the following formula:

  
    
      
        
          
            (

where,

anan−1...a1a0.c1c2c3... is the original representation in the original numeral system.
b is the original radix. b is 10 if converting from decimal.
ak and ck are the digits k places to the left and right of the radix point respectively.
For instance,

 −25.4dec = −(1T×1011 + 1TT×1010 + 11×101−1)
          = −(1T×1011 + 1TT×1010 + 11×101T)

          = −(1T×101 + 1TT + 11×0.010T)

          = −(1T1T + 1TT + 0.11TT)

          = −10T1.11TT

          =  T01T.TT11

 1010.12 = 1T10 + 1T1 + 1T−1
         = 1T10 + 1T1 + 1TT

         = 10T + 1T + 0.1

         = 101.1


== Addition, subtraction and multiplication and division ==
The single-trit addition, subtraction, multiplication and division tables are shown below. For subtraction and division, which are not commutative, the first operand is given to the left of the table, while the second is given at the top. For instance, the answer to 1 − T = 1T is found in the bottom left corner of the subtraction table.


=== Multi-trit addition and subtraction ===
Multi-trit addition and subtraction is analogous to that of binary and decimal. Add and subtract trit by trit, and add the carry appropriately.

=== Multi-trit division ===
Balanced ternary division is analogous to that of binary and decimal.
However, 0.5dec = 0.1111...bal3 or 1.TTTT...bal3. If the dividend is over the plus or minus half divisor, the trit of the quotient must be 1 or T. If the dividend is between the plus and minus of half the divisor, the trit of the quotient is 0. The magnitude of the dividend must be compared with that of half the divisor before setting the quotient trit. For example,

In balanced ternary, there is a simpler division method that does not require comparing the remainders and operates directly according to the rules. This method originated from Donald Knuth trial quotient method, but this method is not perfect. Later, it was improved by other scholars, completely abandoning the judgment of semi-closed intervals and instead using the condition of whether the highest bit of the remainder of each round of division is 0 to determine whether the round of division is over, and named it the double trial quotient method: the core logic is to split the dividend into two vectors (p and s), where the number of digits of p is at most the same as the divisor q, and s is the vector of the remaining digits; then according to the rule (double positive or double negative gives a positive quotient, one positive and one negative gives a negative quotient, and the others are 0), the quotient is subtracted at most once or twice in each round of division. If the highest bit of the remainder p is still not 0 after subtraction once, it needs to be subtracted again. If the highest bit of the remainder p is 0, the round of division is over, and the bit is the double quotient. The value is doubled and the result is given to register r; then the remainder p Shift left one bit, discard the highest bit of the previous round's divisor (already 0), pull one bit of s to supplement it, and get the new remainder p to carry on to the next round. The result r (3 times magnified) is shifted right one bit and supplemented with 0. Then, when s is exhausted, the result r and the dividend p constitute the final quotient and remainder.

== Irrational numbers ==
As in any other integer base, algebraic irrationals and transcendental numbers do not terminate or repeat. For example: 

The balanced ternary expansions of 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
  
 is given in OEIS as A331313, that of 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
  
 in A331990.


== Applications ==


=== In computer design ===

In the early days of computing, a few experimental Soviet computers were built with balanced ternary instead of binary, the most famous being the Setun, built by Nikolay Brusentsov and Sergei Sobolev. The notation has a number of computational advantages over traditional binary and ternary. Particularly, the plus–minus consistency cuts down the carry rate in multi-digit multiplication, and the rounding–truncation equivalence cuts down the carry rate in rounding on fractions. In balanced ternary, the one-digit multiplication table remains one-digit and has no carry and the addition table has only two carries out of nine entries, compared to unbalanced ternary with one and three respectively. Knuth wrote that "Perhaps the symmetric properties and simple arithmetic of this number system will prove to be quite important some day," noting that,

The complexity of arithmetic circuitry for balanced ternary arithmetic is not much greater than it is for the binary system, and a given number requires only

 as many digit positions for its representation."
More recently, balanced ternary numbers have been proposed for some highly-efficient low-resolution implementations of artificial neural networks. In deep learning, neural nets usually use continuous (floating-point) values, but there are many works investigating quantisation and binarisation to create neural nets that can run with much lower power and/or lower memory requirements. Balanced ternary numbers are proposed to be used for the network parameters, because they are extremely compact, but can naturally represent excitatory/inhibitory/null activation patterns.
Balanced ternary may also provide a more natural representation for the qutrit and quantum computing systems that use it.


=== Other applications ===
The theorem that every integer has a unique representation in balanced ternary was used by Leonhard Euler to justify the identity of formal power series

Balanced ternary has other applications besides computing. For example, a classical two-pan balance, with one weight for each power of 3, can weigh relatively heavy objects accurately with a small number of weights, by moving weights between the two pans and the table. For example, with weights for each power of 3 through 81, a 60-gram object (60dec = 1T1T0bal3) will be balanced perfectly with an 81 gram weight in the other pan, the 27 gram weight in its own pan, the 9 gram weight in the other pan, the 3 gram weight in its own pan, and the 1 gram weight set aside.
Similarly, consider a currency system with coins worth 1¤, 3¤, 9¤, 27¤, 81¤. If the buyer and the seller each have only one of each kind of coin, any transaction up to 121¤ is possible. For example, if the price is 7¤ (7dec = 1T1bal3), the buyer pays 1¤ + 9¤ and receives 3¤ in change.
