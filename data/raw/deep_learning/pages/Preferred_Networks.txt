Preferred Networks Inc. is a Japanese startup focused on the research and development of deep learning for IoT applications. The company was spun off from Preferred Infrastructure (PFI), founded by Toru Nishikawa, Daisuke Okanohara, and others on March 26, 2014.


== Overview ==
The company advocates for "Edge Heavy Computing," which involves the distributed, collaborative processing of massive data generated by devices at the edge of the network. It aims to achieve innovation in various fields, focusing on three major business areas: transportation systems, manufacturing, and bio-healthcare. Through the development of the open-source deep learning framework Chainer (development ceased in December 2019), it promotes advanced initiatives in collaboration with organizations such as Toyota Motor Corporation, FANUC, and National Cancer Center Japan.
