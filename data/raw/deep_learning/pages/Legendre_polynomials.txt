In mathematics, Legendre polynomials, named after Adrien-Marie Legendre (1782), are a system of complete and orthogonal polynomials with a wide number of mathematical properties and numerous applications. They can be defined in many ways, and the various definitions highlight different aspects as well as suggest generalizations and connections to different mathematical structures and physical and numerical applications.
Closely related to the Legendre polynomials are associated Legendre polynomials, Legendre functions, Legendre functions of the second kind, big q-Legendre polynomials, and associated Legendre functions.

=== Definition by construction as an orthogonal system ===
In this approach, the polynomials are defined as an orthogonal system with respect to the weight function 
  
    
      
        w
        (
        x
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle w(x)=1}
  
 over the interval 
  
    
      
        [
        −
        1
        ,
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [-1,1]}
  
. That is, 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{n}(x)}
  
 is a polynomial of degree 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
, such that

  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            −
            1
          
          
            1
          
        
        
          P
          
            m
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
        d
        x
        =
        0
        
        
          if 
        
        n
        ≠
        m
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int _{-1}^{1}P_{m}(x)P_{n}(x)\,dx=0\quad {\text{if }}n\neq m.}
  

With the additional standardization condition 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        1
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{n}(1)=1}
  
, all the polynomials can be uniquely determined. We then start the construction process: 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            0
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{0}(x)=1}
  
 is the only correctly standardized polynomial of degree 0. 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{1}(x)}
  
 must be orthogonal to 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{0}}
  
, leading to 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{1}(x)=x}
  
, and 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            2
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{2}(x)}
  
 is determined by demanding orthogonality to 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{0}}
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{1}}
  
, and so on. 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{n}}
  
 is fixed by demanding orthogonality to all 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{m}}
  
 with 
  
    
      
        m
        <
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle m<n}
  
. This gives 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
 conditions, which, along with the standardization 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        1
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{n}(1)=1}
  
 fixes all 
  
    
      
        n
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle n+1}
  
 coefficients in 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{n}(x)}
  
. With work, all the coefficients of every polynomial can be systematically determined, leading to the explicit representation in powers of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
 given below.
This definition of the 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{n}}
  
's is the simplest one. It does not appeal to the theory of differential equations. Second, the completeness of the polynomials follows immediately from the completeness of the powers 1, 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            3
          
        
        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,x^{2},x^{3},\ldots }
  
. Finally, by defining them via orthogonality with respect to the Lebesgue measure on 
  
    
      
        [
        −
        1
        ,
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [-1,1]}
  
, it sets up the Legendre polynomials as one of the three classical orthogonal polynomial systems. The other two are the Laguerre polynomials, which are orthogonal over the half line 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        ∞
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,\infty )}
  
 with the weight 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            −
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{-x}}
  
, and the Hermite polynomials, orthogonal over the full line 
  
    
      
        (
        −
        ∞
        ,
        ∞
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-\infty ,\infty )}
  
 with weight 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            −
            
              x
              
                2
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{-x^{2}}}
  
.


=== Definition via generating function ===
The Legendre polynomials can also be defined as the coefficients in a formal expansion in powers of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  
 of the generating function

The coefficient of 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t^{n}}
  
 is a polynomial in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  
 of degree 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
 with 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        x
        
          |
        
        ≤
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle |x|\leq 1}
  
. Expanding up to 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t^{1}}
  
 gives

  
    
      
        
          P
          
            0
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        1
        
        ,
        
        
          P
          
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{0}(x)=1\,,\quad P_{1}(x)=x.}
  

Expansion to higher orders gets increasingly cumbersome, but is possible to do systematically, and again leads to one of the explicit forms given below.
It is possible to obtain the higher 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{n}}
  
's without resorting to direct expansion of the Taylor series, however. Equation 2 is differentiated with respect to t on both sides and rearranged to obtain

  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              −
              t
            
            
              1
              −
              2
              x
              t
              +
              
                t
                
                  2
                
              
            
          
        
        =
        
          (
          
            1
            −
            2
            x
            t
            +
            
              t
              
                2
              
            
          
          )
        
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        n
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
          t
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {x-t}{\sqrt {1-2xt+t^{2}}}}=\left(1-2xt+t^{2}\right)\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }nP_{n}(x)t^{n-1}\,.}
  

Replacing the quotient of the square root with its definition in Eq. 2, and equating the coefficients of powers of t in the resulting expansion gives Bonnet's recursion formula

  
    
      
        (
        n
        +
        1
        )
        
          P
          
            n
            +
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        (
        2
        n
        +
        1
        )
        x
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        −
        n
        
          P
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (n+1)P_{n+1}(x)=(2n+1)xP_{n}(x)-nP_{n-1}(x)\,.}
  

This relation, along with the first two polynomials P0 and P1, allows all the rest to be generated recursively.
The generating function approach is directly connected to the multipole expansion in electrostatics, as explained below, and is how the polynomials were first defined by Legendre in 1782.


=== Definition via differential equation ===
A third definition is in terms of solutions to Legendre's differential equation:

This differential equation has regular singular points at x = ±1 so if a solution is sought using the standard Frobenius or power series method, a series about the origin will only converge for |x| < 1 in general. When n is an integer, the solution Pn(x) that is regular at x = 1 is also regular at x = −1, and the series for this solution terminates (i.e. it is a polynomial). The orthogonality and completeness of these solutions is best seen from the viewpoint of Sturm–Liouville theory. We rewrite the differential equation as an eigenvalue problem,

  
    
      
        
          
            d
            
              d

          (
          
            
              (
              
                1
                −
                
                  x
                  
                    2
                  
                
              
              )
            
            
              
                d
                
                  d
                  x
                
              
            
            P
            (
            x
            )
          
          )
        
        =
        −
        λ
        P
        (
        x
        )
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left(\left(1-x^{2}\right){\frac {d}{dx}}P(x)\right)=-\lambda P(x)\,,}
  

with the eigenvalue 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
  
 in lieu of

. This is a Sturm–Liouville equation with

, the differential operator on the left is Hermitian. The eigenvalues are found to be of the form
n(n + 1), with

A two-parameter generalization of (Eq. 1) is called Legendre's general differential equation, solved by the Associated Legendre polynomials. Legendre functions are solutions of Legendre's differential equation (generalized or not) with non-integer parameters.
In physical settings, Legendre's differential equation arises naturally whenever one solves Laplace's equation (and related partial differential equations) by separation of variables in spherical coordinates. From this standpoint, the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the Laplacian operator are the spherical harmonics, of which the Legendre polynomials are (up to a multiplicative constant) the subset that is left invariant by rotations about the polar axis. The polynomials appear as 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{n}(\cos \theta )}
  
 where 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  
 is the polar angle. This approach to the Legendre polynomials provides a deep connection to rotational symmetry. Many of their properties which are found laboriously through the methods of analysis — for example the addition theorem — are more easily found using the methods of symmetry and group theory, and acquire profound physical and geometrical meaning.

=== Orthogonality and normalization ===
The standardization 
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        1
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{n}(1)=1}
  
 fixes the normalization of the Legendre polynomials (with respect to the L2 norm on the interval −1 ≤ x ≤ 1). Rodrigues' formula may be employed to give the normalization integral

  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            −
            1
          
          
            1
          
        
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        
          )
          
            2
          
        
        
        d
        x
        =
        
          
            2
            
              2
              n
              +
              1
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int _{-1}^{1}P_{n}(x)^{2}\,dx={\frac {2}{2n+1}}.}
  

The statements of normalization and orthogonality can then be compactly written in a single equation:

  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            −
            1

        (
        x
        )
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
        d
        x
        =
        
          
            2
            
              2

              +
              1

            m
            n
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int _{-1}^{1}P_{m}(x)P_{n}(x)\,dx={\frac {2}{2n+1}}\delta _{mn},}
  

where δmn denotes the Kronecker delta.


=== Completeness ===
That the polynomials are complete means the following. Given any piecewise continuous function

        (
        x
        )

    {\displaystyle f_{n}(x)=\sum _{\ell =0}^{n}a_{\ell }P_{\ell }(x)}
  

converges in the mean to 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)}
  
 as 
  
    
      
        n
        →
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\to \infty }
  
, provided we take

    {\displaystyle a_{\ell }={\frac {2\ell +1}{2}}\int _{-1}^{1}f(x)P_{\ell }(x)\,dx.}
  

This completeness property underlies all the expansions discussed in this article, and is often stated in the form

  
    
      
        
          ∑

where r and r′ are the lengths of the vectors x and x′ respectively and γ is the angle between those two vectors. The series converges when r > r′. The expression gives the gravitational potential associated to a point mass or the Coulomb potential associated to a point charge. The expansion using Legendre polynomials might be useful, for instance, when integrating this expression over a continuous mass or charge distribution.
Legendre polynomials occur in the solution of Laplace's equation of the static potential, ∇2 Φ(x) = 0, in a charge-free region of space, using the method of separation of variables, where the boundary conditions have axial symmetry (no dependence on an azimuthal angle). Where ẑ is the axis of symmetry and θ is the angle between the position of the observer and the ẑ axis (the zenith angle), the solution for the potential will be

Al and Bl are to be determined according to the boundary condition of each problem.
They also appear when solving the Schrödinger equation in three dimensions for a central force.


=== In multipole expansions ===

Legendre polynomials are also useful in expanding functions of the form (this is the same as before, written a little differently):

  
    
      
        
          
            1
            
              1
              +
              
                η
                
                  2
                
              
              −
              2
              η
              x
            
          
        
        =
        
          ∑
          
            k
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          η
          
            k
          
        
        
          P
          
            k
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {1+\eta ^{2}-2\eta x}}}=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }\eta ^{k}P_{k}(x),}
  

which arise naturally in multipole expansions.  The left-hand side of the equation is the generating function for the Legendre polynomials.
As an example, the electric potential Φ(r,θ) (in spherical coordinates) due to a point charge located on the z-axis at z = a (see diagram right) varies as

  
    
      
        Φ
        (
        r
        ,
        θ
        )
        ∝
        
          
            1
            R
          
        
        =
        
          
            1
            
              
                r
                
                  2
                
              
              +
              
                a
                
                  2
                
              
              −
              2
              a
              r
              cos
              ⁡
              θ
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Phi (r,\theta )\propto {\frac {1}{R}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {r^{2}+a^{2}-2ar\cos \theta }}}.}
  

If the radius r of the observation point P is greater than a, the potential may be expanded in the Legendre polynomials

  
    
      
        Φ
        (
        r
        ,
        θ
        )
        ∝
        
          
            1
            r
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            k
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          
            (
            
              
                a
                r
              
            
            )
          
          
            k
          
        
        
          P
          
            k
          
        
        (
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Phi (r,\theta )\propto {\frac {1}{r}}\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }\left({\frac {a}{r}}\right)^{k}P_{k}(\cos \theta ),}
  

where we have defined η = ⁠a/r⁠ < 1 and x = cos θ. This expansion is used to develop the normal multipole expansion.
Conversely, if the radius r of the observation point P is smaller than a, the potential may still be expanded in the Legendre polynomials as above, but with a and r exchanged. This expansion is the basis of interior multipole expansion.


=== In trigonometry ===
The trigonometric functions cos nθ, also denoted as the Chebyshev polynomials Tn(cos θ) ≡ cos nθ, can also be multipole expanded by the Legendre polynomials Pn(cos θ). The first several orders are as follows:

=== Shifted Legendre polynomials ===
The shifted Legendre polynomials are defined as

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                P
                ~
              
            
          
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        (
        2
        x
        −
        1
        )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widetilde {P}}_{n}(x)=P_{n}(2x-1)\,.}
  

Here the "shifting" function x ↦ 2x − 1 is an affine transformation that bijectively maps the interval [0, 1] to the interval [−1, 1], implying that the polynomials P̃n(x) are orthogonal on [0, 1]:

                ~
              
            
          
          
            n

        x
        )
        
        d
        x
        =
        
          
            1
            
              2

    {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{1}{\widetilde {P}}_{m}(x){\widetilde {P}}_{n}(x)\,dx={\frac {1}{2n+1}}\delta _{mn}\,.}
  

An explicit expression for the shifted Legendre polynomials is given by

The analogue of Rodrigues' formula for the shifted Legendre polynomials is

The first few shifted Legendre polynomials are:


=== Legendre rational functions ===

The Legendre rational functions are a sequence of orthogonal functions on [0, ∞). They are obtained by composing the Cayley transform with Legendre polynomials.
A rational Legendre function of degree n is defined as:

  
    
      
        
          R
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            
              2
            
            
              x
              +
              1
            
          
        
        
        
          P
          
            n
          
        
        
          (
          
            
              
                x
                −
                1

                1
              
            
          
          )

    {\displaystyle R_{n}(x)={\frac {\sqrt {2}}{x+1}}\,P_{n}\left({\frac {x-1}{x+1}}\right)\,.}
  

They are eigenfunctions of the singular Sturm–Liouville problem:

  
    
      
        
          (
          
            x

                    1
                  
                  )
                
                v
                (
                x
                )
