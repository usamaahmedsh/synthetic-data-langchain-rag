The Nikon Z6III is a mid-range full-frame mirrorless camera produced by Nikon. The camera was announced on June 17, 2024. It is the successor to the Nikon Z6II released in 2020, becoming the ninth full-frame Z-mount body and the twelfth Z-mount camera body.


== Features ==


=== Image sensor ===
The Z6III features a 24.5-megapixel, partially stacked CMOS sensor, which enables the camera to match the 120fps burst (DX format, 10MP only) capability of the Nikon Z8 and Z9 cameras with fully stacked CMOS sensors. Due to this, Z6III has the fastest readout speed in its class as of June 2024.


=== Image processor ===
The Z6III uses the EXPEED 7 image processor, which is also used in the Nikon Z9, Z8, Zf, Z50II, Z5II, and ZR.


=== Lenses ===
The Z6III uses the Nikon Z-mount, developed by Nikon for its mirrorless digital cameras.
Nikon F-mount lenses can be used, with various degrees of compatibility, via the Nikon FTZ (F-to-Z) and FTZ II mount adapters.


=== Video capability ===
For videographers, the Z6III supports 6K video recording at 60 frames per second. Additionally, it offers 4K recording at 120 frames per second and Full HD at 240 frames per second. The camera includes features such as focus peaking, zebra patterns, and customizable picture profiles to aid in achieving professional-grade video quality.
For streaming applications, the Z6III directly supports both UVC and UAC streaming using its USB-C port.


=== Autofocus and subject detection ===
The Z6III's autofocus system utilizes deep learning AI to improve subject detection and tracking. This makes it highly effective in recognizing and focusing on a variety of subjects, including faces, birds, animals, and moving objects. The eye-detection AF ensures sharp focus on human eyes, which is particularly beneficial for portrait photography.
With FW 2.0, added the auto-capture functionally, allowing the photographer to establish a set of criteria, with the camera automatically taking a picture(s) when those conditions are met.


=== In-body image stabilization ===
The Nikon Z6III includes a robust five-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS) system that can reduce vibration up to 8 stops. The IBIS also uses the same Focus Point Vibration Reduction system first introduced in Nikon Zf, in which the IBIS works at the focus point of the camera rather than the center of the image like the conventional IBIS.


=== Connectivity and smart features ===
The Z6III is equipped with advanced connectivity options, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, facilitating seamless integration with smart devices. This allows for remote camera control and instant sharing of images over a smartphone. The camera also supports USB-C for faster data transfer and charging. Integration with Nikon's Imaging Cloud further enhances workflow efficiency by enabling easy image transfer, storage, and sharing.


=== New Picture Control feature ===
The Z6III has the Flexible Color Picture Control feature within its Picture Control, and allows users to create Picture Control profile with HSL and color grading on top of previously tweak-able Picture Control settings. The Flexible Color Picture Control, or normal Picture Control, can now be made through Nikon's NX Studio software instead of its Picture Control Utility 2.


=== C2PA image authentication ===
FW 2.0 added the ability to do C2PA image authentication. This allows for more secure identification and credibility of content using exif data, following the C2PA standards.
This was temporarily suspended on 5 Sept 2025 due to an issue.
