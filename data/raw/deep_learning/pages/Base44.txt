Base44 is an artificial intelligence-powered platform that enables the creation of web applications and mobile apps through a natural language conversational interface, with no-code development capabilities. The platform was developed by the Israeli startup Base44, founded in January 2025 by entrepreneur Maor Shlomo, a co-founder of Explorium.
In June 2025, Base44 was acquired by web development company Wix.com for approximately $80 million, with plans to integrate its technology into Wix's product suite.


== History ==
The initial version of Base44 launched in October 2024, as part of a broader trend known as vibe coding - AI-assisted software development using natural language.
Shlomo developed the platform independently, without employees or outside funding, following a bootstrap model. He openly shared the development journey on social media – strategies, challenges, and user metrics –a marketing approach known as Build in public. As of March 2025, the company began assembling a small team for support and continued development. By June 2025, Base44 had six employees, all hired in May 2025.


=== Acquisition by Wix ===
On 18 June 2025, Wix.com announced its acquisition of Base44 with the intention of integrating its AI and natural language interface into Wix's website and app builder. The acquisition involved an initial payment of approximately $80 million, plus future earn-out payments through 2029 contingent on meeting business milestones.
The deal occurred less than six months after Base44's founding. Until that point, the company had been entirely self-funded and solely owned by Shlomo. According to the announcement, Base44 will continue to operate as an independent product and business, preserving its identity while leveraging Wix's infrastructure and global reach for accelerated growth.


== Product and technology ==
Base44 provides a no-code development environment based on a conversational chat interface. Users describe their desired application or features via chat, and the system automatically generates all components of the app (both front-end and back-end) including databases, server logic, file storage, and supporting infrastructure. It also handles technical tasks like user permissions, authentication, and deployment transparently in the background.
A unique aspect of Base44 is its "Batteries Included" philosophy: all necessary components for developing and deploying the app are built into the platform, eliminating the need for manual integration of external services. Competing platforms often require users to connect third-party services for databases, file storage, email systems, analytics, and user management. In contrast, Base44 offers these features natively, simplifying the development process and reducing friction for users.
The user experience resembles that of interacting with an AI chatbot like ChatGPT, allowing users to request changes or refinements to the app and see results immediately. The platform supports development in multiple languages, including Hebrew, enabling Israeli users to work in their native language. Base44's core service is free, with paid subscription tiers (ranging from $20 to $200/month) for higher usage and advanced features. Applications can be deployed instantly through Base44's cloud infrastructure, which includes built-in tools for security and code quality management.
