Georgios P. Georgiou is a Greek Cypriot linguist, academic, and author. He is an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the University of Nicosia. He is the Associate Head of the Department of Languages and Literature and Director of the Phonetic Lab. He has been awarded the Cyprus Research Award – Young Researcher 2023 in the field of Humanities and Social Sciences by the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation. In 2024, he was elected Fellow of the Young Academy of Europe.
Georgiou's work concentrates on speech acquisition, language acquisition, speech-language disorders, machine learning, and AI. He authors and coauthors research articles in journals such as Scientific Reports, Attention, Perception and Psychophysics, Applied Acoustics, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders as well as edited volumes including Advances in Second/Foreign Language Acquisition by Palgrave Macmillan, and books such as An Introduction to Issues in General Linguistics.


== Education ==
He obtained a BA in Greek Philology (2007–2011), an MA in Education (2011–2013), and a PhD in Linguistics (2014–2018) from the University of Cyprus.


== Career ==
Georgiou began his academic career in 2018 as a Postdoctoral Researcher and Assistant Lecturer of Linguistics at the Department of General and Russian Linguistics of RUDN University. In 2020, he returned to Cyprus to work as an Associate Lecturer of Linguistics at the University of Central Lancashire. The following year, he served as a Postdoctoral Researcher of Speech-Language Disorders at the Department of Rehabilitation Science of the Cyprus University of Technology. Between 2019 and 2021, he was an Adjunct Lecturer at the Department of Languages and Literature of the University of Nicosia. In 2022, he was elected Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the University of Nicosia.
In 2023, he founded the Phonetic Lab at the University of Nicosia and has been serving as its Director since then.


== Research ==
Georgiou uses statistical modeling and AI methods, including machine learning and deep learning, to study speech and language acquisition and to identify biomarkers for neurological conditions. He aims to optimize second language learning outcomes and to develop prognostic and diagnostic tools leveraging speech and language features to improve clinical research and practice.
Georgiou has developed the Universal Perceptual Model (UPM), which supports a universal capacity to learn nonnative sounds across the lifespan and accounts for the difficulties of learners/listeners in the acquisition of nonnative speech sounds. The model creates predictions based on the acoustic and perceptual similarities of sounds and relies on the overlapping degrees of nonnative speech sounds in relation to native ones (complete overlapping, partial overlapping, nonoverlapping) to determine the discrimination of the former sounds.
Georgiou has contributed to the area of developmental language disorder (DLD) by investigating the language abilities of children across perception and production, using experimental protocols, standardized assessments, and data-driven analyses. Moreover, he identified reliable behavioral markers of DLD (such as deficits in phonological discrimination, timing, and morphosyntactic accuracy). His work on atypical populations also includes speech acoustics in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (grant awarded by the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation; 2024–2026).
He applied AI methods in speech and language, using machine learning – from classical models to deep networks – to model crosslanguage speech perception, build automated screening for language disorders, and detect learning gains after phonetic training. He also developed linguistic-feature methods to distinguish human from AI-generated text, compare AI and human abilities in language processes, and apply speech- and language-based machine learning to clinical diagnosis.


== Honors and awards ==
Georgiou received the Cyprus Research Award – Young Researcher 2023 in the field of Humanities and Social Sciences by the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation. The rationale behind this accolade was, according to the review committee, his consistent production of high-quality research, which is recognized both nationally and internationally, and the excellence of his inter- and intra-disciplinary research, which effectively integrates emerging technologies into his area of expertise, facilitating their application in similar fields. Furthermore, the committee highlighted that the number of his publications in internationally recognized journals exceeds the world average in his field and that the launch of the Phonetic Lab indicates his insight and effective leadership skills.
In 2024, he was unanimously elected Fellow of the Young Academy of Europe as a recognition of his "outstanding scientific achievements", according to the rationale provided by the committee of the organization.
