Replit (), former Repl.it, is an American technology company. Founded in 2016, Replit developed an online integrated development environment (IDE) also named Replit that supports various programming languages. In September 2024, it released the first version of Replit Agent, an AI agent for automating software development, with which users can interact in natural language.


== History ==
In 2009, having seen significant advancements in browser and web technologies, Masad imagined a development environment built on the same premise as Google Docs; that is, allowing the user to write and share code all in a web browser. In 2011, he produced an early open-source version of this concept, called "JSRepl". Because Masad then spent a few years working at various companies, including Udacity and Codecademy, JSRepl was used for the in-browser tutorials of Udacity and Codecademy.
Replit was founded in 2016 by the Jordanian programmers Amjad Masad, Faris Masad, and designer Haya Odeh. It was incorporated in San Mateo. Its name comes from the acronym REPL, which stands for "read–evaluate–print loop". Initially a collaborative coding platform, Replit became with Agent an AI-powered software creation ecosystem centered around the ability to build complete applications by describing them in natural language.
In July 2025, Replit announced a partnership with Microsoft to integrate its development platform with Microsoft’s enterprise tools, including the Azure cloud infrastructure, making Replit’s services available through the Azure Marketplace. That same month, Replit's AI agent went "rogue" and deleted a client company's entire database during a code freeze, against the prompter's wishes. This incident earned a nomination in the 2025 AI Darwin Awards.
