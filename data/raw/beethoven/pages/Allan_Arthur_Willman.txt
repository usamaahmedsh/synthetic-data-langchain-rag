Allan Arthur Willman (variant spellings Alan & Wilman; né Allan Arthur Simpkins; 11 May 1909 Hinckley, Illinois 7 May 1989 Cheyenne, Wyoming) was an American classical pianist, composer, music pedagog at the collegiate level, and longtime chairman of the Department of Music at the University of Wyoming.  Willman was a vanguard creator and influential exponent of twentieth-century contemporary music.  As chairman of the music department at the University of Wyoming, he is credited with rapidly expanding music arts within the institution.  He led the development of a more comprehensive Music Department for aspiring academicians and professionals in performance, composition, education, and musicology.  Between 1940 and 1950, enrollment in the Music Department quadrupled.  Willman was founder of the Wyoming Music Teachers Association; and—with Wyoming businessman and composer George William Hufsmith, Jr. (1924–2002), and Casper conductor Ernest Gilbert Hagen (1913–2000)—Willman was co-founder of the Grand Teton Music Festival in 1962.

Willman earned a Bachelor of Music degree from Knox College Conservatory of Music in 1928 (age 19) under his original name, Allan Arthur Simpkins.  He went on to earn a Master of Music degree from Chicago Musical College in 1930, where he studied with Maurice Aronson (1869–1946), Alexander Raab, and Lillian Powers (1886–1973), who was an associate teacher with Raab and a former pupil of Theodor Leschetizky and Giuseppe Ferrata (1865–1928), who in turn was a certified pupil of Franz Liszt.  Willman then studied in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and Thomas de Hartmann.  Willman had been recommended to Boulanger by Paderewski.  After World War II, while serving as Chairman of the Department of Music at Wyoming, Willman took leave during the 1947–48 school year to study in Lausanne and Paris—Robert R. Becker (1909–1997), a virtuoso violinist and violist who began teaching at Wyoming in 1941, served as Acting Chairman during Willman's sabbatical.


=== Performance career ===
As a concert pianist, Willman performed throughout the United States and in Europe.  During the summer of 1953, Willman made a European concert tour with Rudolf Kolisch, artist-in-residence at the University of Wyoming and leader of the Pro Arte Quartet  They performed in cities that included Vienna and Berlin and over numerous radio networks.  In particular, they performed Arnold Schoenberg's "Fantasie for Violin and Piano," Op. 47, composed in 1949 and published by Edition Peters in 1952.  They also performed works of Ernst Krenek, Edward Kilenyi, Beethoven, Schubert, and Kolisch.
Kolisch was Arnold Schoenberg's pupil and brother-in-law by way of his sister, Gertrud.  Kolisch and Willman performed four times at the Arnold Schoenberg Chamber Music Festival sponsored by the International Summer School for New Music at Darmstadt and Frankfurt, July 16–30, 1952.


=== Artistic residency ===
Nominated by composer A. Albert Noelte (1885–1946) of Northwestern University, Willman was accepted as a fellow of the MacDowell Colony in the summer of 1940  Willman worked there from August 4 to September 7, 1940, and composed "Where the Lilac Blows" for voice and piano.  He also befriended other composers, including Mabel Wheeler Daniels and Normand Lockwood.  Daniels kept in touch with Willman, writing on a least one occasion seeking advice on a composition.  Lockwood composed in Laramie between 1955 and 1957.


=== Teaching career, professorship, and music department head ===

After graduating from the Chicago Musical College in 1930, Willman began teaching at the Boguslawsky School of Music in Chicago—Moissaye Boguslawski had been a piano teacher at the Chicago Musical College.

After returning from Paris in 1936 Willman began teaching music at University of Wyoming, where he remained until retirement in 1974.  From the school years 1941–1942 to 1973–1974, he was head of the Department of Music.  Willman was a proficient recruiter of visiting professors that included:

Allan Willman

Regina Willman

=== Family ===
Willman was the third of five children born to the marriage of Arthur Burton Simpkins, DDS (1872–1937), and Lulu (née Louis Catherine Willman; 1872–1961).  His brother and three sisters all predeceased him:

Thomas Hughes Simpkins (1903–1934)
Sylvia Hope Ann Simpkins (1901–1986), married to Arthur Leslie Decker (1898–1981)
Eudora Mary Simpkins (1900–1986), married to Merle Robb Gallup (1889–1965)
Isabel Burton Simpkins (1912–1939)
In 1942, Willman married Regina Kastberg Hansen (1914–1965), also a composer. In 1956, after suffering from cancer for 8 years, Regina left Allan, and soon thereafter, they divorced.  But they remained in close contact until she died in 1965, after 17 years of cancer.  Regina and Allan never had any children and Allan never remarried.
Willman's original manuscripts, letters from prominent musicians, 26 various musical instruments including Willman's piano, art work and some of Willman's personal library were devised under the will of his estate to his nephew, Gordon Alban Gallup, PhD (born 1927), a retired professor (physics/astronomy) at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.
