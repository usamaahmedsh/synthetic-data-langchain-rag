ʻAbd al-Nūr (ALA-LC romanization of Arabic: عبد النور) is a male given name and, in modern usage, surname. The name is used by Muslims and also by Coptic and Orthodox Christians in the Middle East. It is built from the Arabic words ʻabd and al-Nūr, one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names. It means "servant of the Light".
Because the letter n is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Nur, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd an-Noor. Alternative transliterations include Abdennour and others, all subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.
