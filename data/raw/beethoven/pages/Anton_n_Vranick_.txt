Antonín Vranický, Germanized as Anton Wranitzky, and also seen as Wranizky (13 June 1761 – 6 August 1820), was a Czech violinist and composer of the 18th century. He was the half brother of Pavel Vranický.


== Training and career ==
Born in Nová Říše, he first studied philosophy in Olomouc and then law and music in Brno from 1778 to 1782.
He was a pupil of Mozart, Haydn and Albrechtsberger, as mentioned in a letter from Pavel Vranický to the music publisher André. Then, he returned to the service of Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz of Bohemia, the future patron of Beethoven, and became Lobkowitz's chapel master in 1797. In 1799, he participated in the first performance of Haydn's The Creation.
In June 1804, he performed the first performance of Beethoven's Triple Concerto. In 1807 he was Orchestra director of the Theater am Kärntnertor (the Vienna Court Theater). In 1814, he became director of the Theater an der Wien. He died in Vienna.
