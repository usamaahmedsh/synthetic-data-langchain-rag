== Montreal Chamber Music Festival ==
Brott is the founder and artistic director of the Montreal Chamber Music Festival.
In 1990, Brott moved back to Montreal, with plans to make classical music more accessible to the public by developing an international chamber music festival. His idea gained the approval of then mayor of Montreal, Pierre Bourque. It was decided to hold the Festival at The Chalet de la Montagne situated atop Mont Royal.
In 1995, the first Montreal Chamber Music Festival was held at The Chalet de la Montagne, with Brott as its founder and artistic director. The festival organizers sought out historic locations for the performances and planned concerts by internationally known chamber musicians and chamber ensembles. The aim was to allow promising young chamber musicians to perform with established musicians thereby acquire experience essential to the development of their careers, promote exchanges between Canadian and foreign chamber music artists and enhance the stature of Montreal as a cultural hub for chamber music activity.
In 2006, the Festival participated in the rejuvenation of downtown Montreal known as the "Quartier des festivals". The festival moved to the historic St. James United Church.
The Montreal Chamber Music Festival performs annually in the salle Bourgie at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.
In 2020, due to COVID-19 restrictions prohibiting in-person, live performance, the Festival became a Festival Reimagined. Over an 18-month period it produced over 21 videos when live concerts were prohibited.
Since the fall of 2021, the Festival is back to presenting live concerts.


== Personal life ==
In mid-March 2020, Brott contracted one of the first gravely serious cases of COVID-19 in Canada and was placed in an induced coma intubated in intensive care in Montreal's CHUM Hospital for over 32 days. He has made a complete recovery.
