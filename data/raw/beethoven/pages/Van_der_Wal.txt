Van der Wal (or van de Wal, Vander Wal, Vanderwal, van de Wall, VanderWaal) is a toponymic surname of Dutch origin. The name most likely means someone who lived in the vicinity of the Waal (river) in the Netherlands, a branch of the Rhine. A less likely explanation is the original bearer of the name may have lived or worked at or near a "wal": a river embankment, quay, or rampart. In 2007, Van de(r) Wal was the 47th most common surname in the Netherlands (15,646 people). In Belgium, the form Van de Walle is more abundant.
