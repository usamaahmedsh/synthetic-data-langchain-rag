Mok is a surname in various cultures. It may be a transcription of several Chinese surnames in their Cantonese or Teochew pronunciations, a Dutch surname, a Hungarian surname, or a Korean surname.


== Origins ==

Mok may transcribe the pronunciation, in different varieties of Chinese, of some Chinese surnames spelled as Mo or Mu in Pinyin (which reflects the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation), including:

Mò (莫), spelled Mok based on its pronunciation in Cantonese (Jyutping: Mok6; Cantonese Yale: Mohk; IPA: /mɔːk̚²/) or Teochew (Peng'im: Mog8; IPA: /mok̚⁴/).
Mù (穆), homophonous with the first surname above in Teochew. According to Patrick Hanks, some Cantonese speakers in the United Kingdom and the United States also spell this name as Mok, though Muk is probably a more common transcription of the Cantonese pronunciation (Jyutping: Muk6; Cantonese Yale: Muhk; IPA: /mʊk̚²/).
Mù (牧), homophonous with the first surname above in Teochew.
Mù (睦), homophonous with the first surname above in Teochew.
The Dutch surname Mok is a variant spelling of Mock. The surname Mock might have originated from Moch, a clipping of Mochel (mohel).
The Hungarian surname Mók was originally a given name. That given name might be a hypocorism of Mózes, which is the Hungarian form of the given names Moises or Moses.
There is only one hanja used to write the modern Korean surname Mok: Hwamokhal Mok (睦; 화목할 목), meaning 'harmonious'. The bearers of this surname are almost all members of the Sacheon Mok clan. That clan is so named for its bon-gwan (clan hometown) of Sacheon, South Gyeongsang Province, a city which became part of South Korea after the division of the Korean peninsula. Its members claim descent from Mok Hyo-gi, an official under Gojong of Goryeo. Historically, another hanja meaning 'tree' (木; 나무 목; Namu Mok) had also been used as a surname by the Mok clan of Baekje, but this surname is no longer extant in the Korean peninsula.
