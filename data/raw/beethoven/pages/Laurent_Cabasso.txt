Beethoven: selected in Le Monde among the best records of the year
Diapason d’or for his recording dedicated to Liszt with organist Olivier Vernet.
His latest recording of Beethoven's "Diabelli Variations" and Schubert's "Wanderer-Fantasy", which appeared at the end of 2011 at Naïve records, was unanimously hailed by the press. The record was selected  by France Musique and Télérama where Gilles Macassar wrote: "His recording imposes itself from the start with such a strong evidence, such an impression of "that's it", that one is certain to hold an interpretation that will be a landmark. A reference version? Better: a commitment sovereignly personal, both fully free and scrupulously exact!".
