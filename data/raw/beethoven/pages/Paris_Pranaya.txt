The film released on 18 April 2003 alongside Kutumba (2003). Viggy wrote "Nagathihalli excels once again in Paris Pranaya through sharp dialogs, sober comedy apart from introducing two new talents to Kannada film industry in the form of Raghu Mukherjee and Minal Patil". Chitraloka.com wrote Paris Pranaya "is a panoramic view of Europe besides being palatable, paradigm, pragmatic and praiseworthy. All because of the passionate and diligent director Nagathihalli Chandrasekhar and his team". Despite releasing to positive reviews, the film was a box office failure.
