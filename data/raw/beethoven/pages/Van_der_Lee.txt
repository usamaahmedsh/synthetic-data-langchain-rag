Van der Lee is a Dutch toponymic surname meaning "from the Lee". De Lee / Lede / Lei was a common name for a canal, derived from the verb leiden ("to lead") and the city of Leiden ultimately derives its name from such a canal as well. Families with this name have perhaps six different places of origin in the Netherlands. Variants include Van der Lei(j), Van der Leede and Van der Lede(n).  The Brazilian family name Vanderlei and Wanderley, now also used as given names, was introduced in Brazil in 1637 by the Dutch cavalry captain Gaspar/Caspar van Niehof van der Leij, who may have been born in Gummersbach.
