Homan is a surname with a variety of origins. As a Dutch surname it appears to have originated as an assimilation (fm->m) of Ho(o)fman, making it cognate to names like Hoffman and Van 't Hof, indicating either an occupational (court servant; steward; or farmer) or toponymic origin (man at the homestead, court or farm). The oldest attestation is in the 14th century in Drenthe. In North America, it may be an Americanized spelling of the German names Homann or Hohmann. Homan also exists since the 17th century in Ireland, while in England it may be a variant of Holman. Notable people with the surname include:
