Abramov (male) and Abramova (female) (the form Abramoff is also used among emigrants) are old Russian surnames originating around the 16th century. Variations of the former calendar name Avraam. The surname was common among all social estates and covered the whole territory of the Russian Empire. Sometimes it derived from patronymic.
It was also adopted by Jews following the Partitions of Poland and usually meant "the son of Abram". As it is not allowed to share the same name as a living father, a son whose father was named Abraham would be called Abram as a stand-in for Abraham.
