Van Beuren (pronounced [vɑm ˈbøːrə(n)]) is a Dutch surname. The word van is equivalent to the English "of" and the German von, hence it usually is not capitalized in names. The similar name, Buren, is a city or estate in the Netherlands which was ruled by the Egmond family. Dutch nobles were commonly named after their possessions. Literally translated, the Dutch word buren means "neighbours". The surname van Buren that sometimes is used by the Dutch royal house, is related.
