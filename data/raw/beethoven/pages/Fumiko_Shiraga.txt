Fumiko Shiraga (白神 典子, Shiraga Fumiko; July 5, 1967 – January 13, 2017) was a Japanese-German pianist, a revelation in her country in the late 1990s. She was well known in classical music through both CD recordings and public performances, particularly for her interpretations of piano concertos in disguise and transcriptions of well-known masterpieces for chamber ensemble.


== Biography ==
She began studying piano in her native Tokyo before the age of four, and when she was six, her family moved to Germany. She studied in Essen, Detmold and Hannover. Although born Japanese and well-versed in Japanese culture, she described herself as European and considered Germany her homeland.
In her training, she studied piano with Detlef Kraus (Folkwang Hochschule), Friedrich Wilhelm Schnurr (Hochschule für Musik Detmold) and Vladimir Krainev (Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hannover) graduating in 1995 with the highest honors. She achieved the highest distinction in her soloist examinations. Additional training came from international masterclasses with Nikita Magaloff, Yara Bernette, Jeremy Menuhin, Paul Badura-Skoda and Edith Picht-Axenfeld and from the Polish pedagogue Malgorzata Botor-Schreiber.
Fumiko Shiraga performed as a solo artist and with orchestras, as well as with chamber music ensembles. She was instrumental in reviving transcriptions (for flute, violin, violoncello and piano), by Johann Nepomuk Hummel, of some Mozart piano concertos. She recorded the two Piano Concertos by Chopin in a piano and string quintet transcription (1997) and then, in 2001 and in a similar arrangement, she recorded Beethoven's First and Second piano concertos, as well as piano music by Bruckner, including a piano arrangement of his seventh symphony.
For the last twenty years, she lived in Hamburg, where she died of breast cancer after a long battle with the disease in January 2017, just about four weeks after her last concert.
