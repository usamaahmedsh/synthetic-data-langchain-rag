Deroy or De Roy is a given name and French surname of Norman origin. 

In France, this family name originated from the Normans, the descendants of Norse Vikings who migrated to Amigny, a commune in Manche, Normandy. The derivation is from de meaning "of" and the Old French roy, roi (French pronunciation: [ʁwa]), meaning "king", which was a byname used before the Norman Conquest and a personal name in the Middle Ages.
