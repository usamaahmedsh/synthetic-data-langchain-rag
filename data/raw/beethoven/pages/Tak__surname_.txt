Tak is a Dutch, English, Indian, and Korean surname.


== Origins ==
The Dutch surname Tak originated both from the Dutch-language word tak "tree branch", and as a diminutive of the Germanic given name Theuderic.
The Indian surname Tak/Taak belongs to gotra/clan of Hindu Bagri Kumhars (Khapmaru). It is said that they were descents of Raja Sain Pal, a Rajput ruler. Tak/Taunk is also name of a Rajput clan of India.
As an English surname, Tak is a historical spelling of Tagg, which originated in a variety of ways, including as a diminutive of various Germanic names starting with Dag- (e.g. Dagobert), and as a nickname possibly from Middle English tagge "tatter" (referring to a person wearing tattered clothes) or from Old French tache "belt buckle". One early record of a person with a surname spelled Tak is Hugo Tak of Rushden, Northamptonshire, in the Poll Tax of 1379.
The Korean surname spelled Tak (Korean: 탁) in the Revised Romanization of Korean is written with the hanja nopeul tak (높을 탁; 卓), meaning "lofty" or "outstanding". The same character is used to write the Chinese surname now pronounced Zhuó in Mandarin Chinese. The major bon-gwan (clan hometown) for people with this surname is Gwangsan, Gwangju. See Gwangsan Tak clan.
