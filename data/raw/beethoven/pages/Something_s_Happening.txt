Something's Happening (or SH) is a long-format radio program airing four nights a week on Pacifica Radio-owned KPFK 90.7 FM in Los Angeles, California.  Roy Tuckman (aka "Roy of Hollywood") created it in early 1977 and has hosted, produced, and engineered it ever since.  Each night has a characteristic theme or subject, and all shows typically broadcast from midnight until 6:00 AM, Pacific Time.  Most of the content consists of pre-recorded tapes of lectures, interviews, and rebroadcasts from other audio sources.  There is the occasional live guest, usually at the very start or ending of the show.  One segment, Radio Alchymy, is specifically produced for Something's Happening.
Something's Happening reflects some of the daytime topics of host station KPFK (especially politics), but is able to explore those subjects in greater depth due to more-relaxed time constraints.
