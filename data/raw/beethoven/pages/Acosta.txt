Acosta is a Spanish and Portuguese surname. Originally it was used to refer to a person who lived by the seashore or was from the mountains (encostas). It comes from the Portuguese da Costa (cognate of English "coast", literally translates as "of the coast"), which in Spanish became de Acosta; the exact Spanish counterpart of da Costa is "de la Costa".
