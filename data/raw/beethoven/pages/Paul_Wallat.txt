Paul Wallat was the son of the shoemaker Gustav Wallat and brother of the sculptor Gustav Wallat.  He graduated from a painter's apprenticeship in Rostock and from 1899 to 1902 studied painting at the School of Applied Arts Hamburg.

In 1905 and 1906 Paul Wallat undertook a world tour on the MS "Charlotte" ("by the grace of the Wilhelm II, German Emperor"), later he often was in Holland and Belgium.  On December 29, 1906, he received the award of the Ginsberg Foundation of the Berlin Academy.
