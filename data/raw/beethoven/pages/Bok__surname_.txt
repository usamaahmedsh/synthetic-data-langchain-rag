Bok is a surname of several origins.


== Origins ==
As a Chinese surname, Bok transcribes the Hokkien pronunciations of various surnames spelled in Mandarin Pinyin as Mu (e.g. 牧 'herder'; 穆 'elegant') or Mo (莫). Hokkien spellings of Chinese surnames are often found in Malaysia and Singapore, where many descendants of Chinese migrants can trace their roots to the Fujian province of China.
The Dutch surname Bok comes from the Dutch word for billy goat, bok. Similarly, the Jewish surname Bok, a variant spelling of Bock, originated from the German word for billy goat, Bock.
Bok is the spelling in Revised Romanization of one Korean surname meaning 'divination' (Hanja: 卜; referred to in Korean as 점 복; Jeom Bok or 무 복; Mu Bok). The character used to write this surname, Radical 25, is also used for the Chinese surname now pronounced Bǔ in Standard Mandarin. The largest Korean clan bearing this surname, the Myeoncheon Bok clan, claims common descent from Bok Ji-gyeom, one of the four generals who overthrew Gung Ye of the state of Taebong in 918 and installed King Taejo in his place as the first king of the Goryeo dynasty.
As a Swedish surname, Bok originated as an ornamental surname, from bok 'beech'.
