Adashev (Russian: Ада́шев; masculine) or Adasheva (Ада́шева; feminine) is a Russian last name.
There are three theories regarding the origins of this last name. The most plausible one relates it to a Turkic word adaš, meaning namesake, comrade, friend. It is also possible that this last name derives from nickname "Адаш" (Adash), itself derived from a Vologda and Yaroslavl dialectal word "адать" (adat), meaning to cry, to yell. Finally, it could have developed from the diminutive forms of the Christian first names Adrian and Adam.
