Saturday Stayback was a late-night comedy show that was aired for six episodes from 22 January until 26 February 1983 by Central Television, starring Chris Tarrant. It was performed entirely in a public house.
It was a sequel to O.T.T., itself a spin-off from Tiswas.  From these previous shows were regulars Bob Carolgees and Helen Atkinson-Wood, as well as newcomer to television Tony Slattery. Guest appearances included Frank Carson and, making his TV debut, impressionist Phil Cool.
O.T.T. had been a critical disaster for Central, and had angered the Independent Broadcasting Authority (the commercial television watchdog), so instead of automatically granting a second series, they decided to slash the budget and insisted on pre-recording instead of the show going out live. This decision so enraged producer/presenter Chris Tarrant, who had been largely responsible for the success of Central's Tiswas, that after the meeting with management, he slammed the door so hard that the glass shattered.
Due to the low budget circumstances and keen to keep a laddish air about the format, the decision was made to film from a local pub, and portray it as though they were in an illegal after-hours drinking session. This gave the show the name 'Stayback', which was included in the opening titles and break bumpers, but by the time Central were ready to transmit it, it was decided to be referred to as 'Saturday Stayback', despite this name never being used in the programme.
Tarrant's friend from Tiswas and O.T.T., John Gorman, was used on this show for writing, keeping himself off-screen. Ex-Tiswas presenter Sally James (another friend of Tarrant) was a guest in one show.  Kevin Seisay wrote and performed some of the comedy songs.
Musical guests included Roy Wood, who also contributed the theme tune, heavy rockers Gillan and two appearances by Thin Lizzy.
The show ended after its initial six episode run.
