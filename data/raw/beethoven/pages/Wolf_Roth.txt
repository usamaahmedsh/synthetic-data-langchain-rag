Wolf Roth  (born August 30, 1944) is a German theatre and television actor.


== Early life and education ==
Roth was born in Torgau, Germany, where his family had fled during World War II. He was raised and educated in Bremen. In 1961 he moved to the United States and graduated from the Edsel Ford High School in Detroit, Michigan. He spent the next months travelling through the Midwest of the U.S.


== Career ==
Having returned to Germany, he graduated in Bremen and went on to the Free University of Berlin. He took courses in sociology and economics, but found his vocation when he was taken by friends to the entrance examinations of the famous Max Reinhardt Seminar for actors. He was discovered by the actress Hilde Körber, and while still in the seminar, he was seen and engaged by Boleslaw Barlog. He made his theatrical debut in the play Squaring the Circle by Valentin Kataev in 1967. Subsequently he joined the theatre in Oberhausen, where he portrayed several roles. He left Oberhausen in 1969 to continue his career in Berlin, where he played in the Berliner Theater and the Schaubühne. During this time, he started to work in television and the movies, where his main work has been since then. Films include Goldene Zeiten (2006) (as the character Jürgen Matthies).

=== Piano concerts ===
In his youth Wolf Roth studied to become a professional pianist. At the age of 12 he gave his first concert with Mozart, at the age of 14 he played his first Beethoven concert and at the age of 16, when in the U.S., he played the Warsaw Concerto by Richard Addinsell and the Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin before audiences. As Franz Moor in The Robbers he had to play the piano on stage (it was a modern dress production) and was so good, that it was almost impossible to convince the critics and the audience, that they were watching a 'live performance' and not listening to an audio recording.
