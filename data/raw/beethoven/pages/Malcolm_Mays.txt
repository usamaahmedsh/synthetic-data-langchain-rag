Both the songs and the videos were received with rave reviews by critics. After released of the second track, "Ruthless". Hip-Hop blog This Song Slaps, cited "Malcolm Mays is one of the most under-appreciated hip hop artists around today. He possesses a flow unmatched, dense lyrical content, and a sense of melody that’s truly uncommon within the world of hip hop music."
Mass Appeal stated of the Mays production of the film for the song "Dichotomy, "The video opens with a scene reminiscent of a biblical baptism before cutting to a ballet-esque twerk session. Throughout the video, Malcolm pauses to reflect on his past, but keeps getting distracted by matters of a more physical nature... Don't get too distracted while watching the video, or you might miss out on depth of Malcolm Mays’ lyrical content. Lines like, “I'm trying to live like you, but the truth is, Lord, you had some daddy issues too,” show that Mays talents extend outside of the world of film." Will.i.am said of the video and song, "its crazy fresh... LOS ANGELES coolness".
