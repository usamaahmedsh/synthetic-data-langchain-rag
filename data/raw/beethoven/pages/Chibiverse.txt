Chibiverse is an American animated television series developed by Gino Guzzardo, produced by Disney Television Animation and premiered on Disney Channel on July 30, 2022. The series is based on the studio's Chibi Tiny Tales short series and features and stars chibi versions of various Disney Channel stars and cartoon characters.


== Premise ==
The series centers on the adventures of "chibi" versions of Disney Channel characters as they live in their own universe. The episodes feature several Chibi Tiny Tales shorts, hosted by specific characters who, unlike the shorts, actually speak. As the hosts introduce themselves and announce the next short, a plot is intertwined throughout these snippets until the episode's conclusion.
The first season premiered on July 30, 2022 and concluded on March 4, 2023.
The second season premiered on September 23, 2023 and concluded on August 3, 2024. In the second season, the series switches to a faux game show format, though the season finale is a comedy roast.
The third season premiered on January 18, 2025 and concluded on April 26, 2025. In the third season, each episode of the series is split into 3 segments each, replacing the anthology shorts format.
The fourth season is set to premiere in 2026. In the fourth season, the series will add StuGo characters and have more episodes than before.
