Hugo Hagen (1818 – 14 April 1871) was a German sculptor.


== Life ==

Hagen was born in 1818.
He was a student of Ludwig Wilhelm Wichmann. From 1842 to 1857, he was an assistant in the studios of Christian Daniel Rauch, where he contributed to creating the statues of Frederick the Great on the Unter den Linden, Albrecht Thaer at Humboldt University and Immanuel Kant in Königsberg. In 1865, he became the Director of the "Rauch-Museum". After the early death of Hermann Schievelbein, he helped complete the monument to Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein. He also assisted Rudolf Siemering to complete Johann Gottfried Schadow's "Münzfrieses" (Coin Friezes) on the Old Berlin Mint.

Hagen died 14 April 1871 in Berlin, Germany. Many of his own works were left incomplete when he died.
