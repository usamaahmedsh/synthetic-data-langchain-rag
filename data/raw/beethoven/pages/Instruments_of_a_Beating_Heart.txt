The documentary follows Ayame, a soon to be second grade school girl eager to participate in a group performance of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" to welcome new first graders. Encouraged by the teacher to think beyond herself, Ayame wins the cymbal role in the audition. However, a lack of dedication to her task leads to mistakes during rehearsals, prompting the teacher to emphasize the importance of harmony and diligence.
