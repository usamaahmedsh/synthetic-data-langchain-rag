== Surname ==


=== Origins ===
As a Chinese surname, Kam may be a spelling of the pronunciation in different varieties of Chinese of the following surnames, listed based on their Pinyin spelling (which reflects the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation):

Gān (Chinese: 甘), spelled Kam based on its Cantonese (Jyutping: Gam1; Cantonese Yale: Gām; IPA: /kɐm⁵⁵/), Hakka (Hagfa Pinyim: Gam¹; IPA: /kam²⁴/), and Hokkien (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Kam; IPA: /kam⁴⁴/) pronunciations
Jīn (Chinese: 金), homophonous with the above surname in Cantonese, though not in other varieties of Chinese
Qín (Chinese: 琴), spelled Kam based on its Cantonese pronunciation (Jyutping: Kam4; Cantonese Yale: Kàhm; IPA: /kʰɐm²¹/)
The Dutch surname Kam originated in multiple ways. As an occupational surname, it came from both Dutch kam meaning "comb" (referring metonymically to comb makers, wool combers, or fullers), or from Middle Dutch kamme meaning "brewery". As a toponymic surname, it is a reduced form of Van Kam, referring to Chaam (formerly spelled Kam) in North Brabant, near Breda.
The Jewish surname Kam (Yiddish and Hebrew: קם), also spelled Kamm, originated from various German words, including Middle High German kâm "mould" or kam "comb".
As a Korean surname, Kam is the McCune–Reischauer and Yale Romanization spelling of the surname transcribed in the Revised Romanization of Korean as Gam (Korean: 감; Hanja: 甘); it is written using the same character as for the Chinese surname Gān mentioned above. The bearers of this surname in Korea identify with a number of bon-gwan (hometowns of a clan lineage), including Changwon, Masan, Geochang, Buryeong, Changnyeong, Chungju, and Happo, but all of these are branches of the Hoesan Gam (Kam) clan, and claim common descent from Gam Gyu, a Chinese civil official who came to Goryeo in the retinue of Princess Noguk for her marriage to King Gongmin. It was one of eighteen Korean clans founded by Yuan Dynasty officials who accompanied princesses to Korea.
