Herkenhoff is a surname. Its geographic origin may be the region on the current border area between Germany and the Netherlands. The origin and meaning of the name is uncertain. It could be explained through Dutch, German or dialectic words. The second part of the name surely means "yard". The first part could mean Herke [a goddess], Herken [German dialect, meaning "little lord"] or even "herkennen" [Dutch: "to get to know"].
