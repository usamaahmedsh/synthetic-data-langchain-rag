Viljoen is an Afrikaans surname, derived from the French Villion. It was brought to South Africa in 1671 by French Huguenots who subsequently intermarried with the local Dutch population.
The progenitors of the extended Viljoen clan are François Villion (born in Clermont, France) and Cornelia Campenaar (born in Middelburg, Netherlands). Married in the Cape of Good Hope, they later farmed for a living near Stellenbosch.
