The Afrīdī (Pashto: اپريدی Aprīdai, plur. اپريدي Aprīdī; Urdu: آفریدی) are a Pashtun tribe present mostly in tribal areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
The Afridis are most dominant in the Spin Ghar range west of Peshawar in Tribal areas of modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, covering most of the Khyber Pass and Maidan in Tirah which is their Native Tribal Territory. They are the closest to Orakzai in their language, culture and geographic areas.


== Etymology and origins ==


=== Etymology ===
Herodotus, in his Histories, mentions an Indian tribe named Aparytai (Ἀπαρύται) inhabiting the Achaemenid satrapy of Arachosia. Thomas Holdich and Olaf Caroe have linked them with the Afridi tribe:

The Sattagydae, Gandarii, Dadicae, and Aparytae (Ἀπαρύται) paid together a hundred and seventy talents; this was the seventh province


=== Origins ===
The origin of the Afridis is uncertain. Among the Afridi six Ḵaybar clans are generally distinguished: the Kūkī Ḵēl, Kambar Ḵēl, Kamar Ḵēl, Malek-dīn Ḵēl, Sepāh, and Zakkā Ḵēl (or Zəḵā Ḵēl), in the Khyber pass region. In addition, there are two "assimilated clans" not recognized by the first six, the Akā Ḵēl, settled south of the Bārā river in contact with the Ōrakzī, and the Ādam Ḵēl, occupying a mountainous region between Peshawar and Kohat. This complex clan structure,  perhaps reflects the diversity of the origins of the different ethnic groups forming this great tribe.


== History ==


=== Resistance against the Mughals ===
The Afridis and their allies Khalils were first mentioned in the memoirs of Mughal Emperor Babar as violent tribes in need of subduing. The Afridi tribes controlled the Khyber Pass, which has served as a corridor connecting the Indian subcontinent with Afghanistan and Central Asia. Its strategic value was not lost on the Mughals to whom the Afridis were implacably hostile.
Over the course of Mughal rule, Emperors Akbar and Jahangir both dispatched punitive expeditions to suppress the Afridis, with little success.
Under the leadership of Darya Khan Afridi, they engaged in protracted warfare against the Mughal army in the 1670s. The Afridis once destroyed two large Mughal armies of Emperor Aurangzeb: in 1672, in a surprise attack between Peshawar and Kabul, and in the winter of 1673, in an ambush in the mountain passes. The emperor sent his Rajput general Rai Tulsidas with reinforcements into the mountains to suffocate the revolt and liberate the mountain. Allegedly, only five Mughal soldiers made it out of the battle alive and the rest of the Mughals were brutally slaughtered.


=== British Raj ===
During the First, Second, and Third Anglo-Afghan Wars, Afridis fought against the British; these skirmishes comprised some of the fiercest fighting of the Anglo-Afghan Wars. Ajab Khan Afridi was a well-known independence activist against the British Raj.
The British colonial administration regarded the Pashtun Afridi tribesmen as "martial tribe" under the martial races theory. Different Afridi clans also cooperated with the British in exchange for subsidies, and some even served with the Khyber Rifles, an auxiliary force of the British Indian Army.


=== First Kashmir War ===
Shortly after the Partition of India and the creation of Pakistan, Afridi tribesmen were among the ranks of the Pashtun militias that invaded the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir in October 1947, sparking the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948 and the ongoing Kashmir conflict. Today, Afridis make use of their dominant positions along the Durand Line in areas of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province by controlling transport and various businesses, including trade in armaments, munitions and goods. Beside commercial activities, the Afridis also occupy substantial representation among Pakistan Armed Forces and paramilitary forces such as Khyber Rifles.


== Clans ==

The Afridi Tribe is subclassified into eight sub-tribes (Ḵels), which reflect the different ethnic groups which joined to make the Afrīdīs:

Kūkī Ḵēl
Ali Khel
Kambar Ḵēl
Zakkā/Zəḵā Ḵēl
Kamar/Kamraʾī Ḵēl
Malek-dīn Ḵēl
Sepāh
Akā Ḵēl
Ādam Ḵēl


== Religion ==
Afridis follow the Sunni sect of Islam. Their conversion to Islam is attributed to Sultan (Emperor) Mahmud of Ghazni by Denzil Ibbetson and Haroon Rashid.

== Afridis of Farrukhabad & Malihabad ==
The Afridis of Farrukhabad & Malihabad are descendants of the Afridi Pashtun tribe of the Ali Khel branch, originally from the Khyber Pass region (present-day Pakistan). The community is primarily settled in Farrukhabad and Malihabad (in the Lucknow district of Uttar Pradesh), where they played significant military, political, and literary roles during the 18th and 19th centuries.


=== History ===
The first known ancestor to settle in India was Jahan Khan Afridi, who migrated from Khyber along with his tribe and settled in Farrukhabad. He served as Commander-in-Chief under Muhammad Khan Bangash, the *Bawan Hazari* of the Bangash principality.
Jahan Khan Afridi had eight sons, whose descendants remain in Farrukhabad. One of them, Muhammad Khan Afridi, became the Deputy and Prime Minister of the Farrukhabad State. The ruler Qaim Khan later entrusted the administration of the state to him and retired from governance to focus on religious devotion.
Jahan Khan’s cousin, Yar Beg Khan Afridi, was invited to India along with his five brothers. Initially, they settled in Farrukhabad, but due to political disputes, they later joined Safdar Jang of Awadh. These brothers became known across North India as the “Paanch Bhaiye” (Five Brothers), each commanding his own military regiment (*risala*).
Eventually, the family settled in Qawalhar, a locality of Malihabad, which was inhabited by the Amanzai Pathans. Some members later returned to Farrukhabad and the Khyber region, while others remained in Malihabad, where their descendants became prominent figures in culture, administration, and literature.


=== Notable Figures ===

He was also a distinguished Urdu poet and prose writer, known for his refined literary style and influence in the courts of North India.


==== Josh Malihabadi ====
Shabbir Hasan Khan "Josh Malihabadi", great-grandson of Nawab Goya, became one of the most celebrated poets of Urdu literature. Known as the "Shair-e-Inquilab" (Poet of Revolution), he was honoured with the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India for his literary contributions.


==== Ghaus Mohammad Khan ====
Ghaus Mohammad Khan (Padma Shri), also from the same Afridi lineage, is regarded as India’s first international tennis player and one of the country’s earliest sports pioneers.


==== Dr. Zakir Husain ====
Dr. Zakir Husain (1897–1969), the third President of India, was a descendant of the Afridi family of Farrukhabad. He was an eminent educationist, co-founder of Jamia Millia Islamia, and the first Muslim to hold the office of President of India. His lineage connects to the same Afridi Pathan families that migrated from Farrukhabad to other parts of Uttar Pradesh.


==== Salman Khurshid ====
Salman Khurshid, a senior Indian National Congress politician, lawyer, and former Minister of External Affairs, also traces his ancestry to the Afridi Pathans of Farrukhabad. He is the grandson of Dr. Zakir Husain and continues the family’s legacy of public service and education.


=== Cultural and Historical Legacy ===
The Afridi families of Malihabad remain one of the most influential Pathan lineages in Uttar Pradesh. Their heritage is closely linked to the region’s history, culture, and poetry. The family produced several poets, freedom fighters, and scholars who contributed to India’s cultural and political landscape during the colonial and post-independence periods.
The Afridis of Malihabad are also credited with developing and expanding the region’s mango orchards. Under the patronage and landholdings of the Afridi Pathan families, Malihabad became the center of mango cultivation in Asia.
