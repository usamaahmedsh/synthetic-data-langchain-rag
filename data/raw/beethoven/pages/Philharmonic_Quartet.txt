The Philharmonic Quartet was an English string quartet musical ensemble founded during the period of the First World War and remaining active until the early 1940s, by which time none of the original members were present in the group.

== Early history ==
The quartet championed works by British composers, giving the first performances of works by Arnold Bax, Cyril Rootham and Arthur Bliss. They also performed several works by Eugene Aynsley Goossens, including his String Quartet op.14, which dedicated each of its movements to a member of the group. In addition to performances of standard repertoire by Beethoven and Mozart, the quartet played contemporary works by Ravel, Stravinsky and Debussy.
Some of the players were conscripted into active service during the First World War. When the quartet reappeared in 1918, Goossens had been replaced by 'F. Holding'. The following year, Arthur Beckwith was replaced by 'Mr Peatfield'. Cedric Sharpe was later to found the Virtuoso Quartet in 1924 and was joined by Raymond Jeremy.
