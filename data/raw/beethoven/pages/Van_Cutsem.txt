The Van Cutsem family is an old and notable Dutch family originating in the Flemish Brabant. The family belongs to the Belgian nobility, said to have descended from an illegitimate son of Henry II, Duke of Brabant, who was given a knighthood and an estate, called Cuetssem Velde, near Sint-Pieters-Leeuw. One branch of the family, established in Great Britain, is closely associated with the British royal family.
