Katherine Thomas (born June 6, 1966), best known by her stage name The Great Kat, is an American guitarist and singer best known for her thrash metal interpretations of well-known pieces of classical music. Most feature her using the electric guitar, but on some she uses the violin. Thomas is a classically trained violinist, graduating from the Juilliard School and touring for a time playing conventional classical music before crossing over to metal.  
Her classical background, technical skills and self-promotion are sometimes compared to Yngwie Malmsteen  . In an interview in metallian.com she claimed to be the reincarnation of Beethoven. 
Her public persona, as portrayed in her publicity photos and videos, is mainly compared to that of a dominatrix, albeit in an over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek manner. 
In 1990, Swiss black metal band Mordor recorded for their first demo tape "Odes" a tribute song for Thomas, titled "The Great Kat Is God".
