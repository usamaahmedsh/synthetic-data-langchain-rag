The Miss Montana competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the U.S. state of Montana in the Miss America pageant.
Unlike most state pageants in the Miss America system, Montana does not use preliminary local pageants to limit entrants to the state-level competition. They accept at large contestants after an application and interview process.
Haley Joy Tate of Missoula was crowned Miss Montana 2025 on June 21, 2025, at the Motherlode Theatre in Butte, MT.
