Abdul Hakim (Arabic: عبد الحكيم, romanized: ʻAbd al-Ḥakīm) is a Muslim male given name, and in modern usage, first name or surname. It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Hakim. The name means "servant of the All-wise", Al-Hakīm being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.
The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by e. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part may appear as Hakim, Hakeem, or in other ways. The whole name is subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.
