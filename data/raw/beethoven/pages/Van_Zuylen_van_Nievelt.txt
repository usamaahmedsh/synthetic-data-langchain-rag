Van Zuylen van Nievelt (Dutch pronunciation: [vɑn ˈzœylə(ɱ) vɑ ˈnivɛlt]) is an old noble Dutch family originating from Utrecht. 


== History ==


=== Utrecht ===
The family was already noble from earliest times ("Uradel"). The first known ancestor is the knight Steven van Zulen, who early in the 13th century settled in Utrecht. His descendants married into leading families and built the castle called Zuylen. They later joined Nievelt to their family name, being the name of an estate and castle Nijeveld ("new field") they had acquired. Their main fortune was a result of their activities in impoldering morasses.
From the 19th century to the present, the name of the family was written as Van Zuylen van Nievelt. Members received recognition of nobility in 1814 and the title of baron was confirmed in 1822. Several members of the family lived in Barneveld where they built a castle named Schaffelaar. The Dutch branch of the family became extinct in 1947.
A family Van Zuylen van Nijevelt, originating from Rotterdam, must not be confused with this family.


=== Belgium ===
In the 17th century, Pieter-Frederic van Zuylen (1604–1691) was the first of the family to settle in the catholic southern parts of the Netherlands, nowadays Belgium.. He was an officer in the Spanish army and married Olympio Sindico and Gertrude van Voorst.
This Belgian branch continues under the name van Zuylen van Nyevelt and has many members, until today.

=== Van Zuylen van Nyevelt in Belgium ===
Pieter-Andries van Zuylen (Oudenaarde 1649 - Bruges 1708), a son out of the first marriage of Pieter-Frederic, became the ancestor of the catholic van Zuylens. He was first an officer in the Spanish army and then in the service of prince Eugène de Tour et Taxis. He was appointed by him as postmaster general for Bruges and its surrounding province. He married Caroline Le Febure (1658–1723).
Their son, Jacques-Rodolphe van Zuylen van Nyevelt (Bruges 1691–1752) was also general postmaster. He married Marie-Anne van Steelant (1693–1722) and they had seven children. Amongst them:
Jacques-Antoine van Zuylen van Nyevelt de Gaesebeke (Bruges 1719–1779) married with Claire de la Coste (1724–1804). His descendants omitted to ask for confirmation of their noble status, after 1814.
Jean-Bernard van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1721–1791), general postmaster, married with Isabelle du Bois (1730–1804). They are the ancestors of all van Zuylen van Nyevelts in the Southern Netherlands, later Belgium.


=== Confirmation of nobility ===
Under the United of Kingdom of the Netherlands several children of Jean-Bernard asked for confirmation of their noble status and of their title of baron. This was granted as follows:

1816: Jean-Jacques van Zuylen van Nyevelt van de Haar (he had inherited the estate of de Haar, from a childless member of the Dutch van Zuylens).
1827: Jean-Baptiste van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1755–1837)
1827: Marie-Dominique van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1769–1846)
1828: the sons of Joseph van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1761–1824): Jean-Joseph (1802–1883), Guy (1809–1852), the godfather of Guido Gezelle and Frederic (1814–1881).
1855: the sons of André-Patrice van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1772–1849): Jean-Jacques (1801–1875) and André (1805–1882).
Of the eight sons of Jean-Bernard van Zuylen, only Jean-Jacques (who had thirteen children) has male descendants up to this day. The eldest branch inherited the De Haar estate near Utrecht. They are the branch known as van Zuylen van Nijevelt van de Haar. The last male heir died in 2011.
One of the sons of Jean-Bernard, François van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1764–1835) was accepted within the Bavarian nobility and married Countess Octavia von Jenison-Walworth (a daughter of Count Francis Jenison). This branch became extinct for the males in 1906 with the death of François-Ghislain van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1836–1906) and in 1953 the last female member of the family died, Linda van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1874–1953).
