His paternal grandfather was the illustrious Professor Don Aurelio Ortega y Placeres, considered one of the most brilliant educators of public instruction the state of Veracuz, Mexico produced.  His father was the renowned poet and educator, Professor Don Aurelio Ortega Castañeda, who baptized the city of Orizaba with the title of "Nuestra Señora de los Puentes"("Our Lady of the bridges").


== Early life ==
Armando Manuel Aurelio Ortega Carrillo was born into one of the great families of Spain and the New World. He was a brilliant, very cultured and educated man. From a young age he exhibited enormous artistic and musical talent. At the age of 14 he was already known for his music ability and compositions.  As his talents became known, he went to study with the Jesuit Fathers in nearby Puebla and then at a boarding school in San Luis Potosí, and then in Mexico City with the Marist Fathers. Part of his formation also included studying under Ramón Noble and Uberto Zanolli. He wrote some of the most beautiful poems on the valley of Orizaba, and was often sought out to compose some for important events and ceremonies.{{country data {{{1}}}

== Career ==
He was a brilliant, very cultured and educated man.  More than this, he was an artist.  To his students he imparted his gift and knowledge of music and would explain in great detail the significance of the symphonies of Beethoven and Mozart.
A large collection of his works have been donated to the City of Orizaba and are housed in the Archives of the city's Cultural Center.  Some of his great works include sacred music: Agnus Dei, Pater Noster, Salve Regina, Sanctus, Gloria, Aleluya, the musicals: El Establo, Madrigal Nupcial; his opera/ballet: Esperanza (La Quinceañera), the opera Eugenia Op.3; his ballet: the birth of Venus, the musical comedy: La Portera; Balada de las Violetas y baladas de los Jazmines to name of few.
Many of his works were performed by the stars of his age: the tenor Raphael J. Sevilla, the first ballet dancer Luis Mauricio Caracas, the singer Betty Fabila, Maestro Ramón Noble, the Baritone Fernando Vivanco Barceló, and performances from the Maestro himself, who had a wonderful voice too.
Maestro Armando Aurelio was also known for his drawings and paintings of his beloved Orizaba, Veracruz.  His father, the distinguished poet and teacher Don Aurelio Ortega Castañeda was an obvious influence on Maestro Armando.
