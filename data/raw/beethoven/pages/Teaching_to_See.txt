== Critical reception ==
In 2012 Matthew Carter wrote about the film: "This film is about patient and dedicated teaching, about learning to look and visualize in order to design, about the importance of drawing. There are simple phrases that give insights into complex matters, for example that letterforms are 'memories of motion'."
FastCompany writer Kyle Vanhemert claimed "the film opens the eyes to the design details around you." In her article "Learn to See Like an Artist" at Lifehacker Melanie Pinola called it a "beautifully made film." She wrote "Whether you're an aspiring artist or not, the video can teach you how to really look, notice and appreciate design details, and become more critical and curious in the process." Sean Blanda at Behance 99U wrote "watch the first five minutes and you’ll be hooked."
