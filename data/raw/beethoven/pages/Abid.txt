Abid (Arabic: عابد ‘Ābid), also Abed, literally meaning worshipper, adorer, devout is an Arabic name. It may be either a surname or given name.
In the Russian language, "Аби́д" (Abid), or its form "Ави́д" (Avid), is an old and uncommon male given name. Included into various, often handwritten, church calendars throughout the 17th–19th centuries, it was omitted from the official Synodal Menologium at the end of the 19th century. Its origins are either Arabic (where it means desired) or Aramaic (where it means work, labor). The diminutive of "Avid" is Avidka (Ави́дка). The patronymics derived from "Avid" are "Ави́дович" (Avidovich; masculine) and "Ави́довна" (Avidovna; feminine).
