The Paris Choral Society (or PCS) is an auditioned amateur choir based at the American Cathedral in Paris, France.
The PCS is incorporated as a voluntary association under French law as an Association loi de 1901, and is made up of around 95 singers of different nationalities dedicated to the performance of choral masterpieces. Three concerts are performed every season accompanied by professional orchestras and soloists.


== History ==
Founded in 1994 by a group of non-professional singers under the direction of Edward J. Tipton, the PCS quickly became known for its high standard of performance and its annual Sing-along of Handel’s Messiah which has been held every December since the inception of the choir. The current Interim Music Director is Lewis Hammond.
