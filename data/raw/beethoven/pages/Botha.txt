Botha (pronounced  in non-rhotic dialects of English, Afrikaans pronunciation: [ˈbuəta]) is a common Afrikaans surname, derived from the East Frisian Low Saxon Both. It was brought to South Africa in 1678 by Frederich Botha.
The progenitors of the extended clan were Maria Kickers, her first partner Ferdinandùs Appel, and her later husband Frederich Botha.
