The Pacific Symphony Youth Orchestra (PSYO) is a premier and widely recognized youth symphony orchestra based in Orange County, California, affiliated with the professional Pacific Symphony. Founded in 1993, PSYO was the first educational initiative of Pacific Symphony and is regarded as the preeminent youth orchestra in the Orange County and greater Los Angeles region, known for its high artistic standards and competitive auditions.
PSYO is one of four ensembles within the Pacific Symphony Youth Ensembles (PSYE) program and provides advanced symphonic training to highly talented student musicians in grades 9–12. The orchestra offers its members opportunities to rehearse with Pacific Symphony musicians, receive professional orchestral coaching, and perform full symphonic repertoire. PSYO presents its concert series in the Renée and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts.


== History ==
The Pacific Symphony Youth Orchestra was established in 1993 by the leadership of Pacific Symphony as an effort to cultivate the next generation of orchestral musicians in Southern California. Initially consisting of fewer than 50 musicians, the orchestra grew steadily in size and artistic capability throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, the PSYE umbrella organization was formed, adding additional youth ensembles and solidifying PSYO as the flagship full symphony orchestra of the program.
Over the years, PSYO has expanded its educational initiatives, including sectional coaching, master classes, peer mentoring, leadership opportunities within the ensemble, and direct interaction with composers and conductors. The orchestra has premiered new works, engaged in community performances, and established itself as one of the most competitive youth orchestras on the West Coast.

The orchestra typically consists of approximately 90–100 musicians, representing diverse high schools and educational backgrounds across Southern California. Many members also participate in regional honor ensembles, All-State groups, chamber music programs, and competitive solo festivals.

PSYO emphasizes professional-level discipline and artistic growth. The educational model includes:

weekly rehearsals at the Pacific Symphony artistic facility
sectionals led by Pacific Symphony members
seminars in orchestral professionalism, leadership, and audition preparation
exposure to the symphonic masterworks and contemporary compositions
coaching in ensemble communication and orchestral technique
The orchestra fosters both musical development and interpersonal collaboration, aiming to prepare students not only as musicians but also as disciplined and creative contributors to cultural life.


== Collaborations and performances ==
PSYO regularly collaborates with Pacific Symphony artists, guest soloists, and occasionally with other youth ensembles within PSYE. Major annual performances are held at the Renée and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall, with additional outreach or community performances occasionally taking place at schools, civic venues, or regional arts festivals. Selected performances have included multimedia programming and educational outreach aligned with Pacific Symphony’s artistic initiatives.
