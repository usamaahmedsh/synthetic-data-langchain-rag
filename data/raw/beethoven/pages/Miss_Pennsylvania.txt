The Miss Pennsylvania competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Pennsylvania in the Miss America pageant. Pennsylvania, including early years' city representatives, has won the Miss America crown on five occasions.
Originally held in Hershey, the pageant moved to West Chester where pageants were held during the 1950s. The pageant was held in Altoona from 1974. In 1994, Easton was chosen as the new venue of the pageant and the date was shifted from June to May. In November 2008, the pageant was moved to the Pittsburgh area. In 2019, the competition moved to York, Pennsylvania.
In the fall of 2018, the Miss America Organization terminated the Miss Pennsylvania organization's license as well as licenses from Florida, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, and West Virginia.
Page Weinstein of Pittsburgh was crowned Miss Pennsylvania 2024 on June 15, 2024, at The Appell Center for Performing Arts in York. She will compete for the title of Miss America 2025.
