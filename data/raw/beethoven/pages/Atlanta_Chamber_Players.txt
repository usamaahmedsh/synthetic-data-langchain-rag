Founded in 1976 by pianist Paula Peace, the Atlanta Chamber Players (ACP) is a mixed ensemble of strings, winds, and piano, and has performed in more than 250 cities throughout the United States, Europe, and Mexico. In 2014, Paula Peace retired and pianist Elizabeth Pridgen took her place as the artistic director of the group.
The ACP's repertoire includes traditional classical masterpieces (Beethoven, Brahms) as well as contemporary works (George Crumb, Olivier Messiaen). ACP also has a long-standing commitment to performing the music of living American composers. The ensemble has premiered almost 125 works to Atlanta, Georgia audiences, including world premieres commissioned from composers such as Michael Gandolfi, David Amram, Anne LeBaron, three works from Pulitzer-Prize-winner John Harbison, and a 2014 commission from Adam Schoenberg.
The ensemble has appeared in numerous artistic, educational, and outreach concerts, as well as touring residencies and television and radio broadcasts. As Affiliate Artists at Georgia State University’s School of Music 1990–2006, ACP presented concerts, lectures and master classes. The group was in residence at Kennesaw State University from 1996–2003 and was the Candler Ensemble in Residence at Emory University from 1982–1987. In 1979, ACP was among the first ensembles nationally to participate in Chamber Music America’s prestigious Paul Residency Program.
To promote new chamber compositions in the Southeast, the Antinori Foundation and the ACP launched “Rapido! A 14-day Composition Contest” in 2009. Rapido! has expanded by adding partner ensembles in the Northeast, Midwest, Southwest, and West Coast, promoting up to 500 entries by composers of all ages and resulting in premiere performances in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco, as well as Atlanta. Robert Spano and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra joined the Rapido team in 2012 by adding an ASO orchestral commission to the prize.
