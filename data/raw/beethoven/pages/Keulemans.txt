Keulemans or Ceulemans (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈkøːləmɑns]) is a Dutch surname. It may be of topographic origin, indicating an origin from Cologne (Dutch Keulen) or from a Keule (a Limburgish dialectical form of kuil, "hollow" / "depression"). Alternatively, it may be patronymic, stemming from Cole, an archaic short form of Nicolaas.
