Youra Guller (14 May 1895 – 31 December 1980) was a French classical pianist.


== Biography ==
Guller was born in Marseille as Rose-Georgette Guller, of Russian-Romanian heritage. She began her studies at the age of five. She performed in recitals and at the age of nine enrolled at the Paris Conservatory, where she worked with Isidor Philipp. In the 1930s, on the occasion of a concert tour planned for just 10 days, she stayed in China for eight years, returning to France on the verge of the Second World War and the invasion of German troops. As a Jew, she was forced to restrict her activities and to hide. After the war in the 1950s this prominent pianist performed only occasionally due to illness. She made her New York debut in 1971.
Youra Guller died in Munich at 85.
