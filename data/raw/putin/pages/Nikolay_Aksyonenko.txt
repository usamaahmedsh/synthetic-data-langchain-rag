==== Rumored successor of Yeltsin ====
On 19 May 1999 Aksyonenko was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the Government within the Sergei Stepashin's Cabinet. Previously he was considered by Boris Yeltsin as a candidate for prime minister.

Aksyonenko was actively lobbied by Tatyana Dyachenko, Roman Abramovich and Alexander Mamut. There was a moment when Yeltsin called Gennady Seleznyov (17 May 1999) and said that Aksyonenko's candidacy was being proposed to the Duma, and the speaker announced it at a plenary session. Everyone then made a noise, because Stepashin had already been nominated for the prime minister.Circumstances did not allow Aksyonenko to become president: the Chubais group seriously opposed him. Yeltsin could not allow a split in the government, and therefore found a compromise figure in the person of Putin.
On 16 September 1999, Aksyonenko was re-appointed Minister of Railways in the Vladimir Putin's First Cabinet, retaining the post of First Deputy Prime Minister. He chaired the Government during Putin's trip to New Zealand. On 10 January 2000, Aksyonenko left the post of deputy premier, remaining minister of railways.
