== History ==


=== Background ===

The Crimean Peninsula, historically part of Imperial Russia and later an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, was ceded in 1954 to Ukraine, which administered it until its annexation by Russia in 2014.


=== Ukrainian President of Crimea ===

Under Ukrainian rule, an equivalent post, named President of the Republic of Crimea (Russian: Президент Республики Крым, romanized: Prezident Respubliki Krym), was provided by the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Crimea (de facto a special statute), with jurisdiction over the autonomous city of Sevastopol too. The first presidential elections took place in 1994, won by the pro-Russian separatist Yuriy Meshkov (leader of a coalition named "Russia"), but on 17 March 1995 the Ukrainian parliament, as part of a wider process of reduction of the Crimean autonomy, unilaterally abolished both the statute and the post of President of Crimea.


=== From Ukraine to the Russian Federation ===

In the immediate aftermath of the revolution of Dignity, on 27 February 2014, Russian special forces without insignia stormed the Crimean parliament. A few hours later, pro-Russian deputy Sergey Aksyonov came into the parliament, and asked some of the other deputies to come as well. After the deputies summoned by Aksyonov were let in by the Russian soldiers guarding the parliament building, two votes were held. The first one appointed Aksyonov as the new Prime Minister of Crimea, and the second called for a referendum on Crimea's secession from Ukraine. The results for both of these votes were unanimous. One week later, Aksyonov and other deputies held another vote, resulting in an appeal for Russia to annex Crimea.
On 16 March, a referendum on Crimea's status was held, with the results being overwhelmingly in favor of joining Russia. The next day, 17 March 2014, Crimea's newly installed authorities declared independence and requested to join Russia.
On the same day, Russia recognized the Republic of Crimea as a sovereign state.

On 18 March, the Crimean authorities signed the accession treaty to the Russian Federation, thus forming the Crimean Federal District, subsequently merged into the Southern Federal District.
On 11 April, the State Council of the Republic of Crimea consequently ratified a new constitution, providing for the post of Head of the Republic of Crimea, effective from 14 April of the same year.


== Eligibility and authorities ==

Formally a head of state, the head of the republic is actually a governor, subordinate to the president of the Russian Federation; he oversees the executive, and has the right to legislative initiative in the State Council, which he can also convene exceptionally.
