The first reports of the incident were controversial. During the shooting, the attacker was shot dead by a sniper. One FSB officer died on the spot, another died the next day and a few more people were injured. One bystander was slightly injured. After the incident, security officials displayed aggression to the reporters covering the event. 
The attack took place on the eve of the security services day, when President Putin was at a festive concert dedicated to this day, and the shooting also came hours after Putin's annual press conference. According to preliminary data, the attacker was alone, and his name was Yevgeny Manyurov (Russian: Евгений Манюров), 39, who was from a small town near Moscow. Due to the inconsistency of the special services, the shooting continued after Manyurov was killed; this may have led to additional casualties. 
Soon after the shooting, there was report that the attacker "was shouting slogans typical of Islamic State", but in his apartment, insignia of the NOD movement, known for its provocations against the opposition, was found, along with indications that he was a member of a Neo-Nazi group called the Ethnic National Union. The shooter also possessed propaganda books printed by Atomwaffen Division. The Investigative Committee of Russia opened a criminal investigation into an attempt on the life of a law enforcement officer.
