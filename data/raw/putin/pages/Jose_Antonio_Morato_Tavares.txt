== Early life and education ==
Tavares was born in Balibo on 16 September 1960. His father, João da Costa Tavares, worked at the government. He was the first child of nine siblings. When Carnation Revolution occurred, he was a high school student in Dili. In 1975, a civil war broke out in East Timor, prompting him and his family to seek refuge in Atambua.
As Tavares and his family arrived in Atambua, they stayed in their relative's house and depended on the generous people for their survival. From 1975 to 1976, he did not go to school because he could not speak Indonesian. Afterwards, he moved to Bandung to continue his high school. During his high school years in Bandung, his friend bullied him because of his name and unusual Indonesian accent. Nevertheless, he managed to graduate from high school.

Later, he studied at Murdoch University after obtaining an Australian government scholarship from 1990 to 1992. He studied development studies (1990-1991) and he studied M.A. public policy (1991-1992). While in Australia, he recalled that he studied up to 16 hours every day, even in the toilet. 
Apart from formal education, Tavares also participated in courses such as summer school on the European Union's Foreign and Security Policy in 1996, UNITAR Fellowship Programme in Peacemaking and Preventive Diplomacy in Vienna in 1998, and WIPO's training in Intellectual Property Rights in 2009.
