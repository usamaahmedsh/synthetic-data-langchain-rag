In 1980 together with Jørn Christensen and Ola Snortheim he founded his most prominent project, De Press.
Later he was also involved in an experimental group called Holy Toy.
Apart from being a skilled musician Andrzej is also a painter and an experimental performer.
He exhibits his art in his own gallery in Oslo, and occasionally also in Germany and Poland.
