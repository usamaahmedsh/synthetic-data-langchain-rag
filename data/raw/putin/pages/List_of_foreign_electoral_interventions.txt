Below is a list of foreign electoral interventions by country.


== Albania ==


=== 1991 election (by United States) ===

During the 1991 election campaign, politicians of the center-right Democratic Party of Albania claimed that the US government would provide financial assistance to the country. The US government confirmed these claims in a meeting with Democratic Party members.


=== 1992 election (by United States and Italy) ===

The United States Agency for International Development, National Democrat Institute and the International Republican Institute provided anti-socialist political groups with aid, training, media support and funding. The US embassy also publicly supported the Democratic Party of Albania. The Los Angeles Times also reported that the US government provided advisors and vehicles to the campaign of the Democratic Party of Albania, and threatened to withhold foreign aid to Albania if the Socialist Party of Albania was victorious in the elections.
Italy supported the Socialist Party of Albania, with Italian former prime minister Bettino Craxi accepting honorary membership in the party to give them legitimacy. Italy also gave more aid to Albania than any other country.


== Argentina ==


=== 2007 election (by Venezuela) ===

In August 2007, Venezuelan-American businessman Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson arrived in Argentina on a private flight carrying US$790,550 in undeclared cash. The money was discovered by customs authorities, sparking the Suitcase Scandal (Valijagate). The incident led to speculation that the funds were intended to finance the presidential campaign of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. However, no conclusive evidence was presented to confirm this claim, and the case was closed in 2015 due to the statute of limitations.
In 2021, former Venezuelan intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal alleged that Hugo Chávez’s government had sent funds to Argentina, mentioning Néstor Kirchner specifically. These claims reignited debates over possible illicit financing, but no direct evidence has emerged linking Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to receiving money from Chávez.


=== 2025 election (by United States and Russia) ===

In October 2025, US president Donald Trump announced that he might cut off financial aid to Argentina if Javier Milei lost a crucial legislative election later that month. Milei would later win the legislative election.
The Milei government accused a “non-institutional intelligence operation” of illegally recording and leaking private audio conversations (including those of Karina Milei) to destabilize the electoral process. The government alleged foreign influence, citing “patterns similar to operations attributed to Russian and chavista interests.” Russia formally denied the accusations.


== Australia ==


=== 2019 election (by China) ===

In late 2019, media outlets around the world have reported on alleged efforts by the People's Republic of China to infiltrate the Parliament of Australia by recruiting a spy to run in a constituency during the 2019 Australian federal election.


=== 2022 election (by China) ===

In February 2022, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation revealed a failed attempt by the Chinese government to use a proxy to finance federal Labor candidates in New South Wales.


=== 2025 election (by Russia and China) ===

Australia’s 2025 federal election was subject to significant foreign-interference activity attributed to Russia and China. The campaigns involved coordinated online disinformation — including efforts to “poison” AI chatbots with propaganda via a pro-Russian network, foreign espionage, unlawful intelligence-gathering, and misuse of diaspora community surveillance. Authorities disrupted dozens of espionage and interference operations in the years preceding the election, and in 2025 publicly charged at least one individual linked to China under foreign-interference laws. While there is no public evidence that the vote count was altered, the case illustrates a modern hybrid interference approach: using cyber-espionage, disinformation, AI manipulation and clandestine influence operations.


== Austria ==


=== 1949 election (by Soviet Union) ===
The Soviet part of the Allied Commission for Austria (SČSKA) supported the legalization of the Federation of Independents and the Democratic Union hoping to weaken the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and they forced the Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ) to form a coalition with the Left Socialists.

The SČSKA supported the campaign of the Austrian People's Opposition, a coalition consisting of the KPÖ, Left Socialists (meant to replace the Socialist Party of Austria) and the Democratic Union (meant to replace the ÖVP).


== Bangladesh ==


=== 1973 election (by Soviet Union) ===

According to details from the Mitrokhin Archive, the Soviet Union covertly supported the Awami League in Bangladesh.


== Bolivia ==


=== 1964 election (by United States) ===

According to documents provided by the State Department Office of the Historian, the CIA covertly financed media, political groups, trade unions, student groups and youth groups in order to break the influence of communists and alleged Cuban operatives in Bolivia, as well as to create a stable government that was pro-USA. Over $1,150,000 was dedicated to this task across 3 years. Starting in August 1964, the US government began to covertly fund the MNR (then the largest political party in Bolivia) during the elections. Following the 1964 military coup by General René Barrientos the US government covertly funded him and propaganda supporting his government.


=== 1966 election (by United States) ===

According to documents provided by the State Department Office of the Historian, the CIA covertly funded groups supporting General Barrientos during the 1966 elections and his rivals in order to ensure they'd accept the legitimacy of the elections. With CIA assistance, Barrientos forces killed Che Guevara the next year.


=== 2002 election (by United States) ===

In the Bolivian elections of 2002, the U.S., which had been financing the eradication of coca farms, instructed Ambassador Manuel Rocha to warn Bolivians against voting for socialist candidate Evo Morales, stating that doing so could "jeopardize American assistance and investment." USAID also created the "political party reform project" in Bolivia in 2002, whose aim was to "help build moderate, pro-democracy political parties that can serve as a counterweight to the radical MAS or its successors". The move largely backfired, increasing support for Morales, who finished second in the election. Morales would ultimately be elected president of Bolivia in 2006.


== Brazil ==


=== 1955 election (by United States) ===

Fearing a rise of João Goulart, who the US considered to be a communist demagogue, the United States Information Service increased its budget to educate Brazilians on the alleged dangers of communism and communist front groups, as well as drawing links between the Brazilian Communist Party and the Soviet Union. The US also gave grants to the conservative National Democratic Union. According to documents provided by the State Department Office of the Historian, the USA also provided an increase in credit to the ruling administration to help them win the 1955 elections.


=== 1962 election (by United States) ===

According to Tim Weiner's book Legacy of Ashes, the first use of the brand-new state-of-the-art taping system ordered by John F. Kennedy in the White House in 1962 was to discuss plans to subvert the Brazilian government of João Goulart. Kennedy and his ambassador to Brazil Lincoln Gordon discussed spending $8 million to swing the next elections and to prepare for a military coup against Goulart due to fears Brazil could become a "second Cuba". The CIA and AFL-CIO pushed money into Brazilian political life to people who opposed Goulart. Electoral interference by the US failed to oust Goulart, and the CIA supported a coup that deposed him in 1964, leading to Brazil being ruled by a military dictatorship until 1985.


== Bulgaria ==


=== 2017 election (by Turkey) ===

The Turkish ambassador to Bulgaria appeared in a party election broadcast of Democrats for Responsibility, Solidarity and Tolerance. Prime Minister Boyko Borisov called the involvement "unacceptable" and the leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party Korneliya Ninova categorically denounced any involvement of foreign governments.


=== 2024 election (by Russia) ===

In the October 2024 parliamentary elections, allegations of Russian interference surfaced as pro-Russian parties, such as the ultranationalist Vazrazhdane (Revival), gained significant electoral traction. Analysts estimated that parties with Russian ties could secure around 25% of the vote, raising concerns about Moscow’s influence in Bulgarian politics. The election occurred amid political instability, with seven elections held in four years. Observers from the European Union and the United States expressed doubts over potential external manipulation, while the Kremlin denied any involvement.


== Canada ==


=== 1962 and 1963 (by United States) ===
Canadian prime minister John Diefenbaker (a Conservative) had famously bad relations with U.S. president John F. Kennedy.  Kennedy is widely seen as having publicly intervened in Canadian affairs by inviting the then-opposition leader Lester B. Pearson (a Liberal) to the White House for a banquet with Nobel Prize winners just before the official start of 1962 campaign, failing to rescind the offer when the election was formally called, holding a private meeting with Pearson in the White House, and mentioning only Pearson in his remarks to the Nobel laureates. In the aftermath of the Cuban Missile crisis, Diefenbaker's policy was attacked by the U.S. State department in a statement which McGeorge Bundy bragged had "toppled" the Diefenbaker government.  The U.S. embassy in Ottawa leaked anti-Diefenbaker stories to the media covering the campaign and the Kennedy-friendly Newsweek magazine ran cover story attacking Diefenbaker.  Besides these public interventions, Kennedy secretly sent his personal pollster Lou Harris to work for Pearson's Liberals under an assumed name, despite refusing to allow Harris to work for the British Labour Party under Harold Wilson.  "One of the highlights of my life,” Mr. Harris told The Canadian Press, “was helping Pearson defeat Diefenbaker."


=== 2019 election (by China) ===

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) warned Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau that Chinese Communist Party-affiliated proxies had covertly funded at least 11 federal candidates in the 2019 election. Four months after the 2019 Canadian federal election, the Privy Council Office warned that election interference by China was "likely to be more persistent and pervasive in future elections." In February 2023, CSIS concluded that the Chinese government interfered in the 2019 election.


=== 2021 election (by China) ===

The Rapid Response Mechanism Canada reported that it detected Chinese Communist Party (CCP) disinformation operations to dissuade voters from supporting the Conservative Party of Canada during the 2021 federal election. Kenny Chiu, an outspoken critic of Chinese government's crackdown on dissent and protest in Hong Kong, was a key target of this disinformation campaign. CSIS also produced reports on the Chinese government's strategy to interfere in Canada's 2021 federal election. As a result of a 2021 CSIS report documenting threats to Michael Chong and his family, Chinese diplomat Zhao Wei was expelled from Canada in 2023. In February 2023, CSIS concluded that the Chinese government interfered in the 2021 elections.


=== 2022 election (by China) ===

According to The Globe and Mail, CSIS determined that China's consul-general in Vancouver, Tong Xiaoling, mentored pro-Beijing candidates to run in the 2022 Vancouver municipal election.


=== 2022 leadership election (by India) ===
In March 2025, The Globe and Mail reported that the CSIS believed that agents affiliated with government of India assisted Pierre Poilievre's leadership bid in 2022 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election by fundraising and organizing support for Poilievre.


=== 2025 election (by United States, China, Russia, India and Pakistan) ===

For the federal elections of April 28, 2025, Canadian intelligence agencies warned that China, India, Russia, and Pakistan posed a concrete threat of interference through AI, disinformation, bots, espionage, and hack-and-leak operations. Furthermore, U.S. president Donald J. Trump waged a campaign of diplomatic pressure and rhetoric—proposing the annexation of Canada as the “51st state,” imposing tariffs, and undermining Canadian sovereignty—which many analysts interpreted as an attempt to politically influence the electorate. Trump even commented on election day that voters should vote for “the candidate who will make us the 51st state.”


== Chile ==


=== 1964 election (by United States and Soviet Union) ===

Between 1960 and 1969, the Soviet government funded the Communist Party of Chile at a rate of between $50,000 and $400,000 annually. In the 1964 Chilean elections the U.S. government supplied $2.6 million in funding for candidate Eduardo Frei Montalva, whose opponent, Salvador Allende was a prominent Marxist, as well as additional funding with the intention of harming Allende's reputation. As Kristian Gustafson phrased the situation:

It was clear the Soviet Union was operating in Chile to ensure Marxist success, and from the contemporary American point of view, the United States was required to thwart this enemy influence: Soviet money and influence were clearly going into Chile to undermine its democracy, so U.S. funding would have to go into Chile to frustrate that pernicious influence.The U.S. involvement was later revealed by the Church Committee in 1975.


=== 1970 election (by United States and Soviet Union) ===

According to information released as part of the findings of the Church Committee, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency supported the kidnapping of the Chilean Army Commander-in-Chief General René Schneider in an attempt to prevent the congressional confirmation of Salvador Allende. The attempt failed and Schneider was shot in the process. He died three days later from his wounds. Thereafter, the U.S. continued a vigorous overt and covert campaign to undermine Allende's Presidency, which may have created the conditions for Allende's overthrow in a violent coup, although the U.S. was not directly implicated in the coup. American official Henry Kissinger was quoted by Newsweek in 1974 saying this about Chile: "I don't see why we have to let a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people".
According to details from the Mitrokhin Archive, the Soviet Union covertly supported Salvador Allende.


== Colombia ==


=== 2022 election (by Venezuela) ===

During Colombia's 2022 presidential election, concerns were raised about potential interference from Venezuela, Russia, and Cuba. U.S. ambassador to Colombia, Philip Goldberg, warned that these countries could attempt to influence the election through disinformation campaigns and online propaganda. However, no concrete evidence of direct foreign interference was presented.
Additionally, reports emerged of electoral disruptions along the Colombia-Venezuela border. Complaints were made regarding barriers set up by Venezuelan authorities near the Simón Bolívar International Bridge, which allegedly restricted access for Colombian voters living in Venezuela. Venezuelan officials defended these measures as efforts to maintain order, but critics viewed them as a potential form of interference.


== Congo-Kinshasa ==


=== 1960 election (by Soviet Union, 1960) ===

There was also common speculation in Costa Rica that the National Unification Party (PUN) was being funded by outside forces, notably the Somoza family in Nicaragua. The US government offered to use contacts in the AFL-CIO to assist the PLN in their election campaign. Walter and Victor Reuther provided assistance to the campaign by collecting funds in Detroit. The US government preferred a PLN victory, but acknowledged both candidates were pro-USA and anti-communist.


=== 1970 election (by Soviet Union) ===

The KGB quietly aided the presidential campaign of José Figueres Ferrer by providing his campaign a loan of $300,000 via the Marxist-Leninist People's Vanguard Party in return for a promise of diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union. Once reinstalled as President, Figueres kept his promise.

== Czechoslovakia ==


=== 1990 election (by United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium) ===

The NED provided $400,000 in grants, much of which were used to buy computers, fax machines and copiers that were helpful in the campaign. The British Conservative Party also provided 2 campaign experts, and Christian Democrat parties in Belgium and Germany sent more electronics.

The funds were reportedly transferred through a network of companies and bank accounts, with the money originating from Venezuela. These revelations suggested a form of foreign interference in Ecuador’s elections, as the Venezuelan regime was accused of supporting Correa financially to influence the electoral outcome. Although these allegations emerged after the election, they highlighted potential external influence in the political process.

In the 1948 Italian elections, the administration of Harry Truman, allied with the Roman Catholic Church, funneled millions of dollars in funding to and supplied military advisors for the Christian Democracy party and other parties through the War Powers Act of 1941 in an effort to prevent an election victory for the Popular Democratic Front (FDP), a united front comprising the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and the Italian Communist Party (PCI), both of which had played key roles in the wartime resistance movement. At the advice of Walter Dowling, the U.S. also invited Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi on an official visit and made a number of related economic concessions.
Conversely, former CIA officers involved with the operation say that the Soviet Union funneled as much as $10 million monthly to the communists and leveraged its influence on Italian companies via contracts to support organized labor. However, many of their efforts were ad hoc in comparison to the CIA's, and the Christian Democrats eventually won in a landslide.

The United States planned to hold separate elections in the south of the peninsula, a plan which was opposed by Australia, Canada and Syria as members of the commission. According to Gordenker, the commission acted:

in such a way as to affect the controlling political decisions regarding elections in Korea. Moreover, UNTCOK deliberately and directly took a hand in the conduct of the 1948 election.
Conversely the Soviet Union forbade such elections in the north of the peninsula all together. Faced with this, UNTCOK eventually recommended the election take place only in the south, but that the results would be binding on all of Korea.

The CIA covertly gave financial support to Seewoosagur Ramgoolam of the Mauritian Labour Party in the 1982 general election in an attempt to oust Anerood Jugnath and the Mauritian Militant Movement-Mauritian Socialist Party alliance. This was due to fear that the MMM would close Mauritius' ports to the United States Navy and open up Soviet Armed Forces bases, in addition to challenging US claims to Diego Garcia. The US government authorized the Mauritian government to sell off food aid given to the country via USAID for $2 million, enabling them to create 21,000 jobs to help them win the election.


== Mexico ==


=== 2024 election (by United States) ===

In 2024, Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador accused the United States of interfering in the country's presidential election by allegedly financing opposition groups.

The European Union also said that the two exercises had taken place "under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies". The United States also noted Russian attempts to "undermine Moldova's election and its European integration". The Kremlin, in response, had denounced the votes in Moldova as "unfree", casting doubt on what it said was a "hard-to-explain" increase in votes in favor of Sandu and the EU referendum, and challenged her to "present evidence" of meddling.
Four hundred Moldovan citizens were investigated for allegedly receiving money to choose the "no" option in the referendum and vote for a determined candidate in the presidential election. Those found guilty would have been fined 37,000 Moldovan lei (over 1,900 euros), but were given the option of not receiving punishment if they cooperated with the authorities.
The head of the Moldovan Police, Viorel Cernăuțeanu, stated on 24 October that since September, a total of $39 million, including 15 million that month and 24 million in October, had been transferred to over 138,000 people in Moldova through the Russian bank Promsvyazbank, which is banned in Moldova. He added that the number of people that had benefited from this system would be much greater as they would have received money not only for themselves but also for members of their family. This money transfer system was believed to have started in late spring, and was carried out through applications that people downloaded with instructions from interactive chatbots on Telegram. This allowed them to enter the system and benefit from transfers from the bank. Cernăuțeanu stated that Moldovan police had documented and stopped the activity of such bots in 97 Telegram groups.

== Poland ==


=== 1946 referendum (by Soviet Union) ===

The official results were far removed from the actual results since the vote had been seriously compromised by the communists and their supporters. The communists, who already de facto controlled much of the government and had the backing of the military (both the Polish Wojsko Ludowe and Soviet Red Army), used the police (Milicja Obywatelska) and the secret services (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa) to threaten, assault and even murder opposition activists, switch real ballots for false ones, stuff ballot boxes with false votes, consider blank ballots as "yes" votes, destroy votes not in favour of all or any of the three questions or simply falsify votes. Voting in the army was done on command and without secrecy. The falsification was overseen, just like the later 1947 Polish legislative election, by Soviet experts like Aron Palkin and Semyon Davydov, both high-ranking officers from the Soviet Ministry for State Security.


=== 1947 election (by Soviet Union) ===

Although the agreements at the Yalta Conference called for "free and unfettered" elections in Poland, the Kremlin and the Polish Workers' Party had no intention of permitting an honest election. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was well aware that if Poland held a free election, it would result in an anti-Soviet government. Electoral laws introduced before the elections allowed the government – which since its establishment in 1944 by the Polish Committee of National Liberation had been dominated by the Communists – to remove 409,326 people from the electoral rolls. The 1947 election (along with the previous 1946 referendum) was organized and closely monitored by UB (secret police) specialists, who worked closely with their Soviet counterparts like Aron Pałkin and Siemion Dawydow, both high-ranking officers from the Soviet MGB. In some regions, over 40% of the members of the electoral commissions who were supposed to monitor the voting were recruited by the UB. Bolesław Bierut, head of the provisional Polish parliament (State National Council) and acting president of Poland, asked for Soviet assistance in the election.


=== 2025 election (by Russia, Belarus, United States and Hungary) ===

In the lead-up to the presidential elections of May 18, 2025, Poland detected multiple instances of suspected foreign interference. On April 2, 2025, the prime minister Donald Tusk announced that cyberattacks of “eastern origin” had affected his party’s computer systems, a statement widely interpreted as implicating either Russia or Belarus. Two days before the vote, the websites of coalition parties were hacked, prompting the government to warn of Russian interference. The national cybersecurity agency (NASK) also reported that a number of political ads on Facebook had been funded from abroad and had spent more in the final week than any official campaign committee—ads that supported some candidates and attacked others—raising concerns about illicit election influence with foreign funding. At the same time, Belarusian state-controlled media launched a social media disinformation campaign targeting Polish voters through platforms such as TikTok, X, YouTube, and Facebook, promoting divisive narratives, undermining trust in institutions, and influencing public opinion. In addition to these technical and informational interventions, external political influence was also evident: US president Donald J. Trump and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban publicly endorsed candidate Karol Nawrocki before the election, indicating ideological and international support that many observers interpret as part of a broader sphere of influence.


== Portugal ==


=== 1975 election (by West Germany) ===

Bonn gave  economic support, political recognition and diplomatic initiatives to ensure the victory of the democratic Socialist Party over far-left forces like the Portuguese Communist Party. The Friedrich Ebert Foundation of the ruling Social Democratic Party of Germany gave direct financial support and trained the political cadre of the party.


== Romania ==


=== 2024 election (by Russia) ===

The 2024 Romanian presidential election was marred by allegations of Russian interference, raising concerns over election integrity and the potential geopolitical consequences for NATO and the European Union (EU). Multiple reports from Romanian and international authorities detailed foreign influence efforts, particularly aimed at supporting far-right, pro-Russian candidate Călin Georgescu through the illicit foreign funding of a TikTok campaign. Independent Romanian investigative journalism website snoop.ro reported on 20 December 2024, that according to confidential sources from Romania's National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF), it was Romania's own National Liberal Party that financed at least one social media campaign on TikTok. This reporting was re-published by other media outlets but has not been independently confirmed, nor reported by official government sources.


== Russia ==


=== 1996 election (by United States) ===

The first Russian president Boris Yeltsin won his second term in the 1996 presidential elections
A team of private US citizens, campaign experts organized by Felix Braynin, provided assistance to the Yeltsin campaign. The team consisted of Steven Moore, Joe Shumate, George Gorton and Richard Dresner, who worked in Russia four months and received $250,000, plus payment of all costs and unlimited budget to conduct surveys and other activities.
Simultaneously the US administration ensured a US$10.2 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia  to keep the national economy and pro-Western liberal government afloat. The loan funds were fraudulently misused by Yeltsin's inner circle, and the IMF knowingly turned a blind eye to these facts. Although the aggressive pro-Yeltsin campaign boosted his approval rate from an initial 6% to the 35% that he got during the first round of elections, and later made him win the second round against the Communist competitor, Gennady Zyuganov, with 54% to 41%, there were wide speculations that the official results were rigged.


=== 2024 election (by Ukraine) ===

Attacks on Russian electoral institutions in occupied Ukrainian areas have occurred during the 2024 elections. On 27 February, two bombs targeted United Russia party offices and a polling station in Nova Kakhovka, Kherson Oblast.

On 15 March, an IED injured five Russian soldiers at a polling station in Skadovsk, Kherson Oblast. On 16 March, a Ukrainian drone strike targeted a polling station in Zaporizhzhia and a Russian governor claimed another drone strike killed one person in Kakhovka.
On 12 March, the Sibir Battalion, an armed Russian opposition group, condemned the elections in Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts, calling the process a "fiction". The Freedom of Russia Legion also claimed involvement in the attacks. Putin condemned the incursion as an attempt to disrupt the election. Throughout the election, Belgorod was shelled by Ukraine, killing two people in an apparent effort to disrupt voting. Despite this, a 78% turnout in Belgorod Oblast indicated increased support for Putin.
On 25 March, Mediazona reported the Federal Security Service arrested three suspects in connection with an arson plot against a Putin campaign office in Barnaul, Altai Krai.

== Serbia ==


=== 2012 election (by United States) ===

In April 2012, Rudy Giuliani lobbied for Aleksandar Vučić in his candidacy for mayor of Belgrade. The US Embassy to Serbia released a statement saying that Giuliani's appearance did not represent the United States endorsing any candidate in Serbia's parliamentary upcoming election. Dragan Đilas, the incumbent mayor, responded to Giuliani's appearance, saying  "Giuliani should not speak about Belgrade's future as a man who supported the bombing of Serbia."
On 3 July 2012, the United States' deputy assistant secretary of state, Philip Reeker, conducted undisclosed discussions with Mlađan Dinkić of the URS party in his first day there. When a journalist from B92 asked him what his mission in Serbia was, he replied that he was visiting "because Belgrade is a beautiful city". Subsequently, URS joined the ruling coalition in the Serbian parliament. At the time, Blic published a series of stories from anonymous diplomatic sources, correctly predicting a coalition with URS and SNS, asserting that Reeker's meetings in Belgrade were intended to ensure that the new ruling coalition involve parties which guarantee the continuation of the Belgrade–Pristina negotiations. Additionally, Blic reported that Vučić was against SPS members leading both the BIA and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and asserted that the United States was in agreement with Vučić in disapproval of SPS controlling both state agencies.


== Singapore ==


=== 2025 election ===

In a lead-up to the election, government passed two laws, Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act 2021 in October 2021, and Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Regulations 2023 in December 2023, in order to mitigate foreign interference, and Elections Department (ELC) enacting rules to discourage such actions that are considered as "negative campaigning". Foreign interference has become a flashpoint in the election where on 25 April 2025, Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) ordered Meta Platforms, to restrict Singaporeans' access to social media posts by foreign nationals, notably those of Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) such as national treasurer Iskandar Abdul Samad, who had expressed support for Workers' Party (WP) MP Faisal Manap which was later debunked; Selangor youth chief Mohamed Sukri Omar who criticized Malay-Muslim MPs for failing to represent Muslim interests; and Zulfikar bin Mohamad Shariff, an Australian citizen who renounced his Singapore citizenship in 2020.

=== 2015 election (by India) ===

It was alleged that the Indian Research and Analysis Wing had played a role in uniting the Sri Lankan opposition, to bring about the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa. There had been growing concern in the Indian government, on the increasing influence of economic and military rival China in Sri Lankan affairs. Rajapaksa further upped the ante by allowing 2 Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy submarines to dock in 2014, without informing India, in spite of a stand still agreement to this effect between India and Sri Lanka. The growing Chinese tilt of Rajapaksa was viewed by India with unease. Further, it was alleged, that a RAW agent, helped coordination of talks within the opposition, and convincing former PM Ranil Wickremasinghe not to stand against Rajapaksa, but to choose a common opposition candidate, who had better chances of winning. The agent is also alleged to have been in touch with Chandrika Kumaratunga, who played a key role in convincing Maithripala Sirisena to be the common candidate.


== Taiwan ==


=== 1996 election (by China) ===

In the run-up to the 1996 Taiwanese presidential election, the People's Liberation Army launched ballistic missiles within Taiwan's territorial waters off the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung. This action was intended to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate from voting for presidential candidates that Beijing branded "absolutely identical in attempting to divide the motherland."


=== 2000 election (by China) ===

In the run-up to the 2000 Taiwanese presidential election, Zhu Rongji, the premier of the People's Republic of China at the time, warned that voters should "not just act on impulse at this juncture, which will decide the future course that China and Taiwan will follow" and should "shun a pro-independence candidate", further stating that "[n]o matter who comes into power in Taiwan, Taiwan will never be allowed to be independent. This is our bottom line and the will of 1.25 billion Chinese people." According to Christopher R. Hughes, emeritus professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics, the Chinese government later concluded that the statement helped to produce a counterproductive effect.


=== 2012 election (by China) ===

Prior to the 2012 Taiwanese legislative and presidential elections, an organization controlled by the Taiwan Affairs Office, the Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises on the Mainland (ATIEM), organized discounted flights to Taiwan for Taishang to vote in Taiwanese elections.

=== 2018 election (by China) ===
Taiwan's leaders, including President Tsai Ing-wen and Premier William Lai, have repeatedly accused the People's Republic of China of spreading fake news via social media to influence voters and support candidates more sympathetic to Beijing ahead of the 2018 Taiwanese local elections. Chinese defector Wang Liqiang claimed he had been instructed to interfere in Taiwan's 2018 midterm elections as well as the upcoming race. Taiwan's Ministry of Justice launched investigations into 33 cases of Chinese funding of election candidates. "The story was not as shocking in Taiwan as it was in other parts of the world,” said Lev Nachman, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine, studying social movements and focusing on Taiwan. “It is not news to Taiwanese people that China has been co-opting local organisations for political influence."


=== 2020 election (by China) ===

In the run-up to the 2020 Taiwanese general election, organizations with links to mainland China launched libel lawsuits against journalists investigating their ties and coordination with Chinese government institutions such as the Taiwan Affairs Office.


=== 2022 election (by China) ===

In the run-up to the 2022 Taiwanese local elections, Taiwanese law enforcement carried out raids under the Anti-Infiltration Act on individuals suspected of buying votes on behalf of China. In October 2022, the Chinese government's Taiwan Affairs Office warned that the 2022 Taiwanese constitutional referendum was part of a push toward Taiwanese independence. In August 2023, three individuals connected to united front organizations in Taiwan who attempted to influence the 2022 local elections were indicted for violations of the Anti-Infiltration Act.


=== 2024 election (by China) ===

In the run-up to the 2024 Taiwanese presidential and legislative elections, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council accused China of election interference by launching a trade probe. In October 2023, the head of the National Security Bureau stated that the bureau pays "special attention to the Chinese Communists cooperating with opinion poll and public relations companies for the possibility of manipulating opinion polls and issuing them to interfere in the elections." The following month, the head of the National Security Council stated that short-form video was increasingly used to spread propaganda and disinformation to sway voters. Taiwanese authorities investigated over 2,900 cases of electoral interference.

Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu accused Russia of foreign electoral intervention following an alleged sex tape of Muharrem İnce published a day before he dropped out of the race.


== Ukraine ==


=== 2004 election (by Russia) ===

The Russian government publicly attempted to influence the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. Russian president Vladimir Putin gave public support for candidate Viktor Yanukovych and made public visits to Ukraine on his behalf. According to Kempe and Solonenko, "The overall interest of the Russian elite was to keep Ukraine as a reliable neighbor and partner." This was accomplished by channeling Russian funding and expertise directly into the campaign of Yanukovych or the government of Ukraine, in an effort described as "nakedly partisan". Meanwhile, the U.S., Canada, Poland and Slovakia gave money to build political parties in Ukraine.


=== 2014 election (by Russia) ===

Pro-Russian hackers launched a series of cyberattacks over several days to disrupt the May 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, releasing hacked emails, attempting to alter vote tallies, and delaying the final result with distributed denial-of-service attacks. Malware that would have displayed a graphic declaring far-right candidate Dmytro Yarosh the electoral winner was removed from Ukraine's Central Election Commission less than an hour before polls closed. Despite this, Channel One Russia "reported that Mr. Yarosh had won and broadcast the fake graphic, citing the election commission's website, even though it had never appeared there." According to Peter Ordeshook: "These faked results were geared for a specific audience in order to feed the Russian narrative that has claimed from the start that ultra-nationalists and Nazis were behind the revolution in Ukraine."


== United Kingdom ==


=== 2014 Scottish independence referendum (by Russia) ===

A section of the Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report stated that there was 'credible open source commentary' that Russia conducted operations to influence the 2014 Scottish independence referendum in favour of the 'Yes' side. 
Ben Nimmo, a security expert for the Atlantic Council, alleged that Russian web brigades attempted to discredit the result by spreading false claims that the referendum was rigged to secure a 'No' victory. The Russian contingent of the international observers invited to oversee the referendum would also claim that the conduct of the count did not meet international standards.


=== 2016 Brexit referendum (by Russia, United States and Saudi Arabia) ===

There is ongoing investigation by the UK Electoral Commission, the UK Parliament's Culture Select Committee, and the US Senate, on alleged Russian interference in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum of 23 June 2016.
In May 2017, it was reported by the Irish Times that £425,622 had potentially been donated by sources in Saudi Arabia to the "vote leave" supporting Democratic Unionist Party for spending during the referendum.
Some British politicians accused U.S. president Barack Obama of interfering in the Brexit vote by publicly stating his support for continued United Kingdom membership of the European Union.


=== 2019 Conservative Party leadership election (by Saudi Arabia) ===

Some British Indians spoke out against what they saw as the BJP's meddling in the UK election.


== United States ==


=== 1796 election (by France) ===

The Jay Treaty between the United States and Great Britain took effect in February 1796, and the French government was very unhappy about it. The French foreign minister, Charles Delacroix, wrote that France "must raise up the [American] people and at the same time conceal the lever by which we do so…. I propose…. to send orders and instructions to our minister plenipotentiary at Philadelphia to use all means in his power to bring about a successful revolution, and [George] Washington's replacement."  The French minister (ambassador) to the United States, Pierre Adet, openly supported the Democratic-Republican Party and its presidential nominee Thomas Jefferson, while attacking the Federalist Party and its presidential nominee John Adams.
The foreign intrigue perpetrated by France was unsuccessful, as Adams won the election with an electoral vote count of 71-68.  A significant factor that helped to thwart the French efforts was George Washington's Farewell Address, in which the outgoing president condemned foreign meddling.


=== 1940 election (by Nazi Germany and the United Kingdom) ===

In October 1940, seeking to derail the reelection of incumbent U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt, Nazi Germany bribed a U.S. newspaper to publish a document that Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop hoped would convince American voters that Roosevelt was a "warmonger" and "criminal hypocrite". Leaking the captured Polish government document failed to have its intended effect, and Republican Party presidential nominee Wendell Willkie lost the election.
From 1940 until "at least 1944", the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) orchestrated what Politico's Steve Usdin described as an influence campaign "without parallel in the history of relations between allied democracies" to undermine U.S. politicians opposed to American participation in World War II—much of which was documented in a declassified history by William Stephenson, the head of the SIS front organization British Security Co-ordination (BSC). Usdin stated that "SIS ... flooded American newspapers with fake stories, leaked the results of illegal electronic surveillance and deployed October surprises against political candidates."


=== 1960 election (by Soviet Union) ===

Adlai Stevenson II had been the Democratic Party presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956, and the Soviets offered him propaganda support if he would run again for president in 1960, but Stevenson declined to run again. Instead, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev backed John F. Kennedy in that very close election, against Richard Nixon with whom Krushchev had clashed in the 1959 Kitchen Debate. On 1 July 1960 a Soviet MiG-19 shot down an American RB-47H reconnaissance aircraft in the international airspace over the Barents Sea with four of the crew being killed and two captured by the Soviets: John R. McKone and Freeman B. Olmstead. The Soviets held on to those two prisoners, in order to avoid giving Nixon (who was the incumbent vice president of the United States) an opportunity to boast about his ability to work with the Soviets, and the two United States Air Force officers were released just days after Kennedy's inauguration, on 25 January 1961. Khrushchev later bragged that Kennedy acknowledged the Soviet help: "You're right. I admit you played a role in the election and cast your vote for me...." Former Soviet ambassador to the United States Oleg Troyanovsky confirms Kennedy's acknowledgment, but also quotes Kennedy doubting whether the Soviet support made a difference: "I don't think it affected the elections in any way."


=== 1968 election (by South Vietnam) ===

In the last months of the presidential election between Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced an October surprise, intended to aid Humphrey, by declaring a cessation to the bombing in the ongoing Vietnam War and a new round of peace negotiations. In response, Humphrey's popularity grew, eventually leading Nixon by three percentage points.
However, the South Vietnamese government, in consultation with the Nixon campaign, announced three days prior to the election that they would not be participating in the talks, and Nixon went on to win the vote by less than a percentage point.


=== 1980 election (by Iran) ===

Throughout the 1980 presidential election, negotiations were ongoing between the administration of Jimmy Carter and the government of Iran regarding 52 American citizens who had been taken hostage in November 1979. Although it was recognized that negotiations were nearing a successful conclusion, the government of Iran delayed their release until after the election, potentially in retaliation for the decision of Carter to admit the deposed Iranian leader Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to the United States for cancer treatment.
Opinions differ as to the intentional nature of the delay with regard to the outcome of the election. A ten-month investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives concluded that there was "virtually no credible evidence to support the accusations." However, former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr claimed there was a deal between Reagan and Iran to delay the release in exchange for arms.
In a declassified memo from 1980, the CIA concluded "Iranian hardliners – especially Ayatollah Khomeini" were "determined to exploit the hostage issue to bring about President Carter’s defeat in the November elections."


=== 1984 election (by Soviet Union) ===

When Ronald Reagan was running for reelection as president, the Soviet Union opposed his candidacy and took active measures against it. Soviet intelligence reportedly attempted to infiltrate both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee.


=== 1996 election (by China) ===

In February 1997, officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced they had uncovered evidence that the Government of China had sought to make illegal foreign contributions to the Democratic National Committee. Despite the evidence, both the presidential administration and the Chinese government denied any wrongdoing.


=== 2012 election (by Israel) ===

In 2012, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert claimed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried to undermine President Barack Obama in favor of Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Former prime minister Ehud Barak said that the interference cost Israel aid. Netanyahu has denied that. The accusations included claims that Obama had deliberately snubbed Netanyahu, and another implied that an appearance in a television advertisement was designed by Netanyahu to give support to Romney.


=== 2016 (by multiple countries) ===
Interference in the 2016 election by entities connected to the Russian government was a scandal that dominated the news during the first half of the presidency of Donald Trump.


==== 2016 election (by China) ====
In 2023, the United States Department of Justice indicted Gal Luft for allegedly acting as an unregistered foreign agent on behalf of the Chinese government in an attempt to influence the 2016 United States elections.


==== 2016 election (by Russia) ====

In October 2016, the U.S. government accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 United States elections using a number of strategies including the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and leaking its documents to WikiLeaks, which then leaked them to the media. Russia has denied any involvement.
In response, on 29 December 2016, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and broadened sanctions on Russian entities and individuals.
In January 2017, following a British intelligence tip-off, the U.S. Intelligence Community expressed "high confidence" that Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign designed to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections, undermine confidence in the U.S. democratic process, harm Secretary Hillary Clinton's chances, and help Donald Trump win.


==== 2016 election (by Ukraine) ====
Although the Ukrainian government denied it took sides, officials of that government attempted to undermine Trump and assist Clinton.  Ukrainian antipathy for Trump, and alignment with Clinton, can be traced back to 2013 when Paul Manafort (who managed Trump’s campaign from June to August 2016) did work for Viktor Yanukovych, then the president of Ukraine allied with Russia.


==== 2016 election (by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) ====
Special counsel Robert Mueller investigated a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and an emissary for two Gulf monarchies. In August 2016, Trump Jr. had a meeting with envoy representing Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler Mohammad bin Salman and Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates. The envoy offered help to the Trump presidential campaign, although it is unclear what form of help they provided to the Trump campaign if any. The meeting included Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation, and Blackwater founder Erik Prince. Donald Trump also registered eight new businesses in Saudi Arabia during the election campaign.


==== 2016 election (by Israel) ====
According to The Times of Israel, Trump's longtime confidant Roger Stone "was in contact with one or more apparently well-connected Israelis at the height of the 2016 US presidential campaign, one of whom warned Stone that Trump was “going to be defeated unless we intervene” and promised “we have critical intell[sic].” The exchange between Stone and this Jerusalem-based contact appears in FBI documents made public".


=== 2018 election (by Russia, China and Iran) ===

U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats accused Russia, China and Iran of trying to influence the 2018 United States elections.


=== 2020 election (by Russia, China, and Iran) ===

U.S. officials have accused Russia and Iran of trying to influence the 2020 United States elections. Donald Trump has separately accused China of influencing the election.
On 13 February 2020, American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump re-elected. China and Iran were found to support the candidacy of Joe Biden though no active election interference by either country was reported. Bloomberg News reported in January 2020 that American intelligence and law enforcement were examining whether Russia was involved in promoting disinformation to undermine Joe Biden as part of a campaign to disrupt the 2020 election. On 21 February 2020, The Washington Post reported that, according to unnamed US officials, Russia was interfering in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries in an effort to support the nomination of Senator Bernie Sanders.
On October 21, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said that Iran and Russia had obtained US voter registration data and that Iran had sent intimidating emails to voters under the name "Proud Boys," a far-right group.
In March 2021 a declassified report found that Russia's electoral interference was meant to support Trump, Iran's electoral interference was meant to hurt Trump, and China did not seek to influence the outcome.


=== 2022 election (by multiple countries) ===


==== 2022 election (by China) ====
In March 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted individuals, including a Ministry of State Security officer, for surveilling and conspiring to smear and physically attack Chinese American political candidate Xiong Yan. In September 2022, Meta Platforms removed fake accounts linked to a China-based influence operation ahead of the 2022 United States elections. In October 2022, Mandiant reported that Chinese state-backed advanced persistent threat group Dragonbridge was attempting to dissuade Americans from voting in the 2022 midterm elections via fake social media accounts and falsified news articles. In early November 2022, Twitter disrupted several China-based fake account networks aimed at influencing the U.S. midterms.
In 2023, a declassified report from the Director of National Intelligence stated that "Chinese authorities tacitly approved operations to influence a handful of political races in the United States in 2022."

In the run-up to the 2024 United States elections, Microsoft stated that it detected a network of social media accounts, starting in March 2023, run by the Ministry of Public Security using generative artificial intelligence seeking to sway US voters. The Ministry of Public Security's Spamouflage influence operation was identified as having used fake social media accounts to impersonate voters in an attempt to amplify divisions in US society. In April 2024, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that Washington had seen evidence of attempts by China to interfere in the 2024 United States elections.


==== 2024 election (by Cuba) ====
According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Cuban government undertook "localized influence operations that are much more narrowly focused on opposing anti-regime candidates in the United States" during the 2024 elections.


==== 2024 election (by Russia and Iran) ====

According to Microsoft and Politico, beginning in July 2024, a group linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps targeted the Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign with an email phishing attack, which triggered an FBI investigation. It has also created fake news sites and impersonated activists in an attempt to stoke division and sway voters in swing states.


== Uruguay ==


=== 1971 election (by United States and Brazil) ===

Operation Thirty Hours was a Brazilian military plan to invade Uruguay in 1971. Brazil was under a military dictatorship, governed by Emílio Garrastazu Médici. During that time Uruguay was in an electoral process and the possibility of victory by the left-wing Frente Amplio (Broad Front) frightened both the Brazilian rulers and the Tupamaros, an Uruguayan urban guerrilla group. However, the Broad Front was defeated at the polls and the plan was cancelled.
In December 1971, US president Richard Nixon boasted to UK prime minister Edward Heath that Brazil, an ally of the USA, had rigged the election to ensure that the "leftists" lost.


== Venezuela ==


=== 1958 election (by Soviet Union) ===

The CIA covertly funded Thiệu and his political allies, as well as pressuring political parties to act in a compliant way.


== Yugoslavia ==


=== 1997 Montenegrin presidential election (by the United States) ===

Milo Đukanović's victory had enormous international implications, as Robert Gelbard explicitly stated that "the United States government supports the election of president-elect Đukanović." On 12 January 1998, Gelbard visited Montenegro, where he condemned demonstrations against Đukanović's inauguration. Gelbard claimed that Momir Bulatović (who had been backed by the Yugoslav government) promised him in person that he would recognize the election results. On 13 January 1998, Bulatović told supporters in Podgorica that he spoke with Gelbard, stating, "I had the opportunity and privilege to speak with [Gelbard], and I asked him how do they know in America what we don't know in Montenegro? From where did this idea occur to the American administration, which is highly valued and influential, that we're preparing an armed rebellion and violence?" Bulatović denied to the crowd that he had promised Gelbard to recognize the result. He ultimately rejected the election result, and asserted that the United States helped determine the outcome.

"The fact is that over two years ago we recognized that Milo Đukanović had the potential to become an effective counterweight to Milošević and his authoritarian policies. I began meeting with Đukanović regularly even before he became the President of Montenegro a year and a half ago. I was with him during his inauguration when we felt that a strong international presence, a public presence, would deter a Milošević-inspired coup."
Additionally, Bulatović claimed that US secretary of state Madeleine Albright was informed of the election result before the electoral commission made an announcement. He also claimed that the electoral judge had revealed personal details of intimidation.

"The chairman of the electoral commission, the Judge Marko Dakić (who in my mind was a fair person and an excellent lawyer) asked me to see him amongst the audience. He was on the verge of physical and mental breakdown and visibly under huge pressure as a consequence of continuous lack of sleep. He explained in a rather confused manner what was happening...that they were under intolerable pressure to announce the result. He was mentioning threats that had been directed at him and that he had a fear both for his family and himself. All in all it was clear that he had to announce that Milo was the victor."


=== 2000 election (by the United States) ===

In October 1999, the National Democratic Institute hosted a conference at the Marriott Hotel in Budapest, inviting activists from the Serbian opposition. In the conference, Douglas Schoen advised opposition activists to campaign in a united coalition. At the conference, activists were shown an opinion poll commissioned by Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, depicting Vojislav Koštunica with a greater probability of beating Slobodan Milošević in an election than that of Zoran Đinđić. Koštunica's critical stance on the United States was also significant, as he and his party, Democratic Party of Serbia, categorically rejected US financial support. In spite of this, Koštunica was an inevitable beneficiary of US support, witting or not, as other parties associated with either the DOS coalition or the Otpor! movement received a sum of $41 million in financial support from the United States from 1999 to 2000. USAID provided 5,000 spray cans for anti-Milošević graffiti and the printing of 2.5 million stickers with the message "Gotov je", or "He's finished". The United States also paid for the training of electoral monitors in Szeged, Hungary, and subsequently paid monitors $5 each after the election.
On 15 August 2000, the United States Department of State announced the opening of an office of Yugoslav affairs within the US embassy in Budapest. The Department of State added that the office "will consist of State Department and [USAID] officials and will work to support the full range of democratic forces in Serbia". The office's budget and specific role was not disclosed by diplomats at the time. Koštunica, already under attack by accusations of collaborating with foreign powers, called the office "the kiss of death".


=== 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum (by the United States and Russia) ===

According to an investigation supported by the Puffin Foundation Investigative Fund in 2008, The Nation reported that Milan Roćen authorized a contract with Davis Manafort Inc, a consulting firm founded by Rick Davis, and that the firm was paid several million dollars to help organize the independence campaign. Election finance documents did not record any exchanges with Davis Manafort, although the claims of the payments were backed by multiple American diplomats and Montenegrin government officials on the condition of anonymity.
Almost one decade later, Paul Manafort revealed during his trials that he had been hired by Oleg Deripaska to support the referendum in Montenegro. In a discussion with Radio Free Europe in 2017, Branko Lukovac, a former campaign chief for the independence bloc, claimed that he was not aware of a contract with Manafort, but acknowledged the following:

"We in America had especially strong support and a group of friends on top with former presidential candidate Bob Dole, who contributed in Congress, Senate, State Department, and further circles, we even had access to Colin Powell...to support our movement to independence."
Dole had been paid a sum of $1.38 million by the Montenegrin government for lobbying between 2001 and 2008. Lukovac denied any contract with either Manafort or Deripaska, claiming that Russian president Vladimir Putin told his campaign that "he'd prefer to for us to stay in the state union Serbia and Montenegro rather than separate, but if that is what is democratically defined by the majority of Montenegrin citizens, that they [Russia] would support that."
