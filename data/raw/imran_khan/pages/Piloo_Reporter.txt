== Biography ==
Reporter was born in Bombay on 24 September 1938.
He started his career with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. He responded to an advertisement by the then-Bombay Cricket Association calling for umpires. He failed the tests initially, but, later made it as an umpire with the association and started by officiating as an umpire in the domestic circuit. His first match as an umpire in a domestic Ranji Trophy match was at the age of 29. In 1984, he made his  international umpiring debut in both Test matches and one day internationals (ODI), standing in 14 Tests and 22 ODI's until 1994.

In 1986, Reporter and V.K. Ramaswamy became the first neutral umpires from India when they stood in a Test match featuring Pakistan and West Indies in Lahore. This was the first time neutral umpires had officiated in a Test since 1912. They were invited by the Pakistan captain, Imran Khan after allegations of bias by Pakistani umpires. Reporter was the only Indian umpire to officiate in the 1992 Cricket World Cup that was held in Australia and New Zealand.
Reporter was from the Parsi community and was known as "PD" in the cricketing fraternity. The method by which Reporter signalled a boundary had been called "Milkshake" by cricket commentator Henry Blofeld. His autobiography, An Umpire Remembers, was published by Rupa & Company in 2004.
In 1993, Reporter was allegedly paid to give his assessment of the pitch prior to a test in Calcutta to bookie Mukesh Gupta.
