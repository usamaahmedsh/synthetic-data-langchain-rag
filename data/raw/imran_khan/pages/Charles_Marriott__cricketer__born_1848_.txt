In addition to playing first-class cricket, Marriott played minor matches for Leicestershire from 1872–87, prior to their elevation to first-class status. He served as club president on three occasions. In his later years he served several times on the committee of the MCC. Outside of cricket and his legal profession, he also served in the Leicestershire Yeomanry from 1873–83, reaching the rank of captain. He died at Cotesbach in July 1918.
