Islamabad Cricket Stadium  is a state-of-the-art under-construction cricket stadium in Islamabad, Pakistan. The project was initiated on the directives of the former cricketer and Prime Minister, Imran Khan and responsibility for overseeing the construction was entrusted to Ehsan Mani, the former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

The government has started the construction of the stadium and has granted approval to the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to commence the construction process. Various potential locations have been under consideration by the CDA for the establishment of this new stadium, with particular attention given to the scenic and logistical advantages of the foothills of the Margalla Mountains. A definitive choice regarding the stadium's location will be made in due course. The CDA had previously initiated a project for building a stadium in Shakarparian, but it was discontinued due to a decision by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. However, in this new endeavor, the CDA has chosen a parcel of land near Sector D-12 as the location for the stadium's construction. Officials from the CDA have clarified that this area falls within Zone III, and in accordance with the master plan and zoning regulations of 1992, the civic agency is permitted to construct sports and entertainment facilities within this designated zone.

The stadium's design incorporates a high-performance center and is set to serve as the venue for a diverse array of both international and local tournaments and fixtures. Additionally, it will feature a five-star hotel designed to accommodate visiting international teams. This not only enhances their security but also contributes to alleviating traffic congestion throughout the entire city.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is targeting the completion of the stadium by 2025, aligning with Pakistan's role as the host for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy..However political unrest in Pakistan during recent times has led to a delay in the stadiums' completion and it is not featuring in ICC Champions Trophy 2025.
