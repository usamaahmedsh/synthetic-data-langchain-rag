Federal Tribunal Verdict:

A federal tribunal in Karachi has cancelled benami property cases worth billions of rupees against several directors of the Omni Group, ruling that the Benami Transactions Act of 2017 cannot be used for deals made before the law existed. The two-member bench also noted that applying the law to older cases was “beyond legal authority.”
The ruling covered multiple assets and companies linked to Omni Group directors Muhammad Younus Kodwai, Aslam Masood, Abdul Ghani Majid, and Khawaja Salman Younus. These included commercial plots in Karachi and shareholdings in Thatta Cement Company Limited.
