Lee played most of the 1963–64 season in the New South Wales team, scoring 253 runs at 25.30  and taking 14 wickets at 45.07. At one stage he was considered a possibility to be selected in the Australian team to tour England in 1964. He played for an Australian XI against the touring South Africans in Melbourne, but with little success. A week later, for New South Wales against the South Africans, he top scored with 68 in the New South Wales second innings total of 147.
He returned to the Lancashire League in 1964. East Lancashire finished third, Lee scoring 833 runs at 39.66 and taking 63 wickets at 11.53.
Lee was less successful in 1964–65 and 1965–66 and played irregularly for New South Wales. He returned to better form in 1966–67, finishing the season with 254 runs at 23.09 and 15 wickets at 23.60. In a low-scoring match against Queensland in mid-season he scored 45 and 8 not out and took 2 for 26 and 4 for 19. In the next match a week later, he and John Gleeson bowled South Australia out for 87, Lee taking 4 for 28. He played the first three matches of the 1967–68 Sheffield Shield season but without success.
