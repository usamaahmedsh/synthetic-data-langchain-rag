This is a list in alphabetical order of cricketers who have played for Sussex County Cricket Club in top-class matches since it was founded in 1839. Like the Sussex county teams formed by earlier organisations, including the old Brighton Cricket Club, the county club has always been classified as a top-class side. The players listed have played for the club in first-class cricket, List A cricket or Twenty20 cricket matches. 
The details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Sussex player and then his name is given as it would appear on modern match scorecards. Note that many players represented other top-class teams besides Sussex. Current players are shown as active to the latest season in which they played for the club. The list has been updated to the end of the 2021 cricket season using the data published in Playfair Cricket Annual, 2022 edition.
The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team; and players whose first team appearances were in minor matches only.
