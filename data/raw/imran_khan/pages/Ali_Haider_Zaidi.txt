Following the 2005 earthquake in Azad Kashmir, Zaidi initiated the creation of the Imran Khan Foundation to support disaster relief, as the Imran Khan Cancer Appeal Foundation, registered as a 501(c)(3) charity in the U.S., was restricted to supporting the cancer hospital. Within ten days, the new foundation raised between $600,000 and $1 million for earthquake victims and later secured its own 501(c)(3) status.
