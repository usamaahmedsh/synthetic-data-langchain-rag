NA-102 Faisalabad-VIII (این اے-102، فیصل آباد-۸) is a constituency of the National Assembly of Pakistan, located within the Faisalabad District. This constituency encompasses part of Faisalabad City.
Historically, the constituency was a stronghold of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), which secured significant victories in earlier elections. However, the political landscape shifted in favor of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in recent years. PTI secured wins in both the 2018 Pakistani general election and the 2022 Pakistan by-elections. This trend continued in the 2024 Pakistani general election, where Changaiz Ahmed Khan Kakar, supported by PTI, emerged victorious.
