Wally McGlinchey (often spelled McGlinchy) was an off-spin bowler from Newcastle, New South Wales. A tall, well-built man, he bowled off-spin at medium-pace and was a useful batsman. 
He represented Newcastle against the English team in 1882-83, and played a few matches for New South Wales. He toured New Zealand with New South Wales in 1890, playing all five first-class matches and taking 30 wickets at an average of 8.96, including 4 for 27 and 6 for 62 in the victory over Canterbury. He moved to Queensland in 1893 and played several matches for the state team in the era before they joined the Sheffield Shield competition. He toured New Zealand with Queensland in 1896-97, once again playing all five first-class matches, taking 22 wickets at an average of 17.04, including 5 for 63 and 5 for 73 in the match against New Zealand.
