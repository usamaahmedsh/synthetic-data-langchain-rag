John Hamlin Borrer (date of birth unknown – 1854) was an English cricketer.  Borrer's batting style is unknown.  Though his date of birth is unknown, it is known he was christened at Henfield, Sussex on 2 March 1817.
While studying at the University of Oxford, Borrer made his first-class debut for Oxford University against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1837.  The following season he played a second first-class match for Oxford University against the same opposition, with both matches coming at Lord's.  In that same year he made a single first-class appearance for Sussex against Kent at the Old County Ground, West Malling.  He batted at number eleven in Sussex's first-innings, scoring 1 not out, while in their second-innings he was promoted to open the batting, scoring 6 runs before he was dismissed by Alfred Mynn.  Borrer later made a first-class appearance for Petworth against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1845.  He had little success in this match, scoring 2 runs at number eleven in Petworth's first-innings, before he was stumped by William Dorrinton off the bowling of William Lillywhite, while in Petworth's second-innings ended not out on 1.
He died at the village of his christening sometime in 1854.  He was the nephew of the botanist William Borrer.
