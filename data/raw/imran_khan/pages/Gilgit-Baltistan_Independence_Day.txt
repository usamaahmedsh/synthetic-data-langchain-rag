On this day in 1947, Brigadier Ghansara Singh, the governor appointed in Gilgit by Maharaja Hari Singh of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, was arrested by the local force of Gilgit Scouts under Major William Brown through a military coup and with that, freedom was secured in Gilgit. An independent state was established here in the name of the Republic of Gilgit of which Raja Shah Rais Khan was appointed as the president and Captain Mirza Hassan Khan as the military chief. Fifteen days later, the people of Gilgit announced their accession to Pakistan on the basis of Islamic relations, and in this regard, the heads of both the states of Hunza and Nagar signed formal documents of accession with the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
