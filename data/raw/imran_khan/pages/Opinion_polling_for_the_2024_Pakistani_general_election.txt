In the run up to the 2024 Pakistani general election, various organisations have been carrying out opinion polling to gauge voting intention throughout Pakistan and the approval rating of the civilian Pakistani government, first led by Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf until 10 April 2022 and then by Shehbaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (N), with the latter government being supported by the Pakistan Democratic Movement and the Pakistan People's Party. The results of such polls are displayed in this article. The date range for these opinion polls are from the previous general election, held on 25 July 2018, to the present day.           
Opinion polling near elections by top Pakistani election surveyors namely Gallup Pakistan, Center for Public Opinion Research, Institute of Public Opinion Research (IPOR) and IRIS showed that PMLN has regained its position against its rival PTI since June 2023, mainly due to return of Nawaz Sharif from exile and Supreme court’s decision disallowing bat symbol. Center for Public Opinion Research conducted a public opinion survey of the central Punjab a week before the 2024 elections where the Majority 41% of the respondents said that they will vote for PMLN during the upcoming general elections, while 34% said PTI and 7% said they will vote for TLP in upcoming general elections.

== National Assembly Voting intention ==

The results in the tables below (excluding the column on undecided voters and non-voters) exclude survey participants who said they wouldn't vote or they didn't know who they would vote for and add up to 100%. In polls that include undecided voters or non-voters, percentages are adjusted upwards in order to make the total equal 100%. Margins of error are also adjusted upwards at the same rate to account for the increase.


=== Nationwide ===


=== Punjab ===


=== Sindh ===


=== Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ===


=== Balochistan ===


=== Islamabad Capital Territory ===


== Government approval rating ==
The results in this table show polls that surveyed whether people approved or disapproved of either the overall (not on a single issue) performance of the federal government in Islamabad or the Prime Minister's overall performance since 18 August 2018.
The same rounding restrictions that were given in the previous section do not apply here, so occasionally, results will add up to 101% or 99% due to rounding errors, and neutral respondents (when data is available for them) are counted in this table, unlike the last table.
