Albert George Cheetham (7 December 1915 – 23 May 1997) was an Australian cricketer. He played 24 first-class matches for New South Wales and the Australian Services XI between 1936 and 1946.
Cheetham was an all-rounder, a middle-order batsman and opening bowler. He made his highest first-class score and took his best bowling figures in the same match: 85 and 4 for 75, when New South Wales defeated Queensland in the opening match of the 1939–40 Sheffield Shield.
In World War Two, Cheetham served in the Australian Army's anti-tank forces from 1940 to 1945, finishing with the rank of captain. He moved to Adelaide in late 1945 to work as the manager of an insurance company. He married Marion McLeish in Adelaide in July 1946.
