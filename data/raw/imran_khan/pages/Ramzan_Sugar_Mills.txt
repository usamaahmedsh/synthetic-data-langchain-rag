== Power project ==

=== NAB Proceedings ===
In 2018, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) initiated proceedings against then Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his son, Hamza Shahbaz, on allegations that they had inflicted a loss of Rs 213 million to the public exchequer through misuse of authority. They stated that Shehbaz Sharif directed the construction of a drain in Chiniot district for the principal benefit of Ramzan Sugar Mills using public funds.
On October 17, 2024, under Shehbaz Sharif's tenure as the Prime Minister, amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 modified NAB's jurisdiction so that the case could no longer be tried by the bureau. The revised law restricted NAB from pursuing cases involving sums below Rs 500 million, while the amount in question in the Ramzan Sugar Mills reference was lower than that threshold.
On February 6, 2025, the anti-corruption court, having reserved its ruling earlier, approved the acquittal applications submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Hamza Shahbaz.


=== Bridge Construction ===
After the 2014 floods hit Jhang District, politician Imran Khan criticized the mill and an under-construction bridge in Bhawana, claiming in a speech that Sharif group were only constructing the bridge to save their mill not the people. He also claimed that the mill had only paid the farmers 70 percent of the offered price for sugarcane, and that too after one year.
