The World Governments Summit is an annual event since 2013, held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It brings together leaders in government for a global dialogue with a focus on issues of futurism, technology and innovation. The summit acts as a knowledge exchange hub between government officials, thought leaders, policy makers and private sector leaders to discuss future trends, issues and opportunities facing humanity. The summit has typically hosted approximately 90 speakers from 150 participating countries, along with some 4000 attendees.


== History ==
The World Governments Summit was formed in 2013 by a team of experts from different disciplines to bring government, business and civil society together with the goal of improving the future for the seven billion people on the planet. The chairman of the World Governments Summit is Mohammad Al Gergawi with Ohood bint Khalfan Al Roumi and Omar Al Olama serving as Vice Chairs of the organization.

In 2015, under the directive of His Highness Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum (Ruler of Dubai) and Mohammad Al Gergawi (chairman of the summit's organizing committee and minister of the UAE Cabinet Affairs & The Future) announced ten key changes to take the summit to a new global level. The changes included changing the summit's name from Government Summit to World Governments Summit, changing the entity structure and adopting the goal of providing integrated knowledge services for over 150 governments and global organizations.
In 2016, the World Governments Summit Organization adopted a new year-round membership system. Members have exclusive invitations to attend the summit, communicate directly with its top speakers and attendees, receive reports issued by the summit ahead of general public, gain exclusive access to private functions held on the sidelines of events, and have access to training workshops and executive education programs hosted by the summit in collaboration with global experts.
As of 2018, reports for the public about issues explored at the summits were typically issued by Summit members and contributors, on the World Governments Summit website, and many conferences speeches were available on the Youtube Channel for the World Governments Summit.
