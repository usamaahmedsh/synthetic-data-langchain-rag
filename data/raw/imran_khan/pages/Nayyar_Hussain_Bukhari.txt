On 29 December 2018, Bukhari was indirectly accused by Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) professor Pervez Hoodbhoy of stealing QAU land and building a personal 'palace' as well as other buildings for his relatives upon the stolen university land. In the Dawn newspaper op-ed, Hoodbhoy mentioned "The palace’s owner proudly identifies himself as former chairman of the Pakistan Senate and a member of the PPP. For a few short days during 2013, he had also been the acting president of Pakistan...Thereafter, a hitherto unnamed road running across the campus suddenly acquired a signboard — "Nayyar Bukhari Road".
On 5 January 2019, the Capital Development Authority (Islamabad) along with Islamabad Capital Territory demolished the structures that were built illegally as a part of Mr. Bukhari’s residence as a part of an anti-encroachment drive led by the two to retrieve land that belongs to the Quaid-i-Azam University.
