Frost Over the World is a television interview and news talk show, with Sir David Frost as host. The show was broadcast on Al Jazeera English. Frost, a famed English television presenter, interviewed well-known  politicians, diplomats, writers, thinkers, academics, entertainers, business leaders, scientists, humanitarians, and other newsmakers. The editor of the programme was the journalist Charlie Courtauld and producers include Richard Brock, Kate Newman, Alex Nunes and Portia Walker.
The show launched in November 2006 and Britain's then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was the first guest to appear.
The show was replaced by The Frost Interview on Al Jazeera English. Unlike Frost Over the World, which was set in a studio, The Frost Interview involved David Frost travelling around the world. Frost hosted that show until his death in 2013.
