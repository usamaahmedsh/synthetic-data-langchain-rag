His teammate Mashrafe Mortaza, who was bought in the auction by the Kolkata Knight Riders, said "I would have been a lot happier if Shakib had got a team because he truly deserved it for his sensational form with the bat and ball". Shakib had no buyers in the 2010 IPL auction as well, which was very surprising considering his stature in international cricket at the time.
For the 2011 Indian Premier League, Shakib was contracted by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) for US$425,000. He made his debut in the tournament on 15 April 2011 in a match against Rajasthan Royals.

Between 2019 Indian Premier League, BCB wanted to call Shakib back for the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup preparation camp but he skipped the camp for match practice even after playing only 1 match at that time. Shakib was hoped for some IPL matches before World Cup 2019 as Jonny Bairstow and David Warner would leave for their respective World Cup preparation camps.
Shakib was released by the Sunrisers Hyderabad ahead of the 2020 IPL auction after playing for 2 seasons.
Shakib was listed at the highest base price of INR 2 crore for the 2021 IPL auction and was subsequently bought by his former team KKR again for a price of ₹3.2 crore (US$380,000). After the suspension of the 2021 Indian Premier League, Shakib and Mustafizur Rahman returned home on 6 May 2021 via a chartered flight arranged by the BCCI with their respective franchises sharing the cost of the flight.

In September 2006, Shakib was one of three players to be granted a rookie contract with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), along with Farhad Reza and Mehrab Hossain Jr. This increased the number of players with central contracts and under the control of the BCB from 20 to 23.
Shakib was included in the 15-man squad led by Habibul Bashar for  the 2007 Cricket World Cup hosted  West Indies in March and April. Bangladesh made it to the second stage of the competition and finished seventh. Along the way the team caused an upset by beating India to help knock them out of the tournament. With Tamim Iqbal in just his fifth ODI and Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib was one of three Bangladesh batsmen in the match to score a half century to help the team reach its target of 192 to win. Later in the tournament, Shakib scored another half-century although Bangladesh were defeated by England on that very occasion. He scored 202 runs from 9 matches at an average of 28.85 with a high score of 57* and achieved 7 wickets at an average of  43.14 with an economy of 4.96.

Later that year, in May, India toured Bangladesh for two Tests and three ODIs. On 18 May, Shakib made his Test debut against India. He batted once, scoring 27 runs, and bowled 13 overs without taking a wicket as the match ended in a draw. In his 2nd match he batted twice scoring 30 and 15 runs and bowled 19 overs without taking any wickets where also wicket-kept for 8 balls till India's innings declaration, as India won by an innings and 238 runs. India won the Test series 1–0 and the ODI series 3–0. After the tour, Dav Whatmore resigned from his position as Bangladesh coach, and batsman Mohammad Ashraful replaced Habibul Bashar as captain.
In September 2007, South Africa hosted the ICC World Twenty20. Victory against West Indies in the first round was enough to ensure Bangladesh's progression to the second round, although it was the only one of their five matches they won. In the match against West Indies, Shakib took 4/34; it was the first time a Bangladesh player had taken more than three wickets in an International Twenty20 match (T20I). Shakib was part of another piece of T20I history when in a match against Australia in the tournament he became one of three victims of the first T20I hat-trick. Brett Lee took Shakib's wicket, followed by those of Mortaza's and Alok Kapali to help Australia to a nine-wicket win. In October that year, it was announced that Jamie Siddons – Australia's assistant coach – would take over the role of Bangladesh coach; Siddons asserted that the previous set-up had focused on short-term goals and that he was planning to improve Bangladesh over the long term and keep together a core squad of talented players to gain experience at international level.
In December 2007 and January 2008, Bangladesh toured New Zealand for two Tests and three ODIs. Although he did not play the first Test, Shakib was selected over Enamul Haque Jr for the second due to his better batting ability. It was Shakib's fourth Test, and until that point he had gone wicketless. His first wicket was that of New Zealand's Craig Cumming. New Zealand won by an innings and 137 runs and took the series 2–0. New Zealand also completed a clean sweep in the ODIs which preceded the Tests, winning 3–0. Shakib played in all three ODIs scoring 31 runs at an average of 10.33, and taking 3 wickets at an average of 42.33. Over February and March 2008 South Africa toured Bangladesh, playing two Tests and three ODIs. South Africa won both Tests. Shakib played in both Bangladesh's defeats, taking just one wicket while conceding 122 runs, and scoring 75 runs. South Africa won the subsequent ODI series 3–0. Shakib passed 1,000 ODI runs in the series; he passed the landmark in his 39th ODI with a batting average of 35.37.
Before New Zealand's tour of Bangladesh in October 2008, Shakib was considered more of a batsman than a bowler, despite being an all-rounder. Though he usually batted down the order at number seven in Tests, he had mostly batted in the top five in ODIs. In a departure from Shakib's usual role Jamie Siddons, the coach stated that Shakib would play the Test series against New Zealand as a specialist bowler. The move immediately paid off, and he took 7/37 in New Zealand's first innings in the opening Test which were the best bowling figures by a Bangladesh player in all their 54 Tests suppressing the previous best innings figures by a Bangladeshi bowler set by another left-armer Enamul Haque with 7–95 against Zimbabwe at Dhaka three years ago., He scored 71 for his maiden Test half-century to guide the home team to 184–8 in their second innings. Bangladesh lost the series 2–0, but Shakib finished as Bangladesh's leading wicket-taker in the series with 10 wickets at 17.80. His spell was nominated to be the Best Test Bowling Performance of 2008 by ESPNcricinfo.
Bangladesh won the opening match of the ODI series against New Zealand – securing their first ever ODI win over them – although they eventually lost the series 2–1. Shakib finished with five wickets from three matches, making him Bangladesh's second-highest wicket-taker for the series behind Mashrafe Mortaza (7); however Shakib scored just 16 runs in the series.
The following month, Bangladesh toured South Africa for two Tests, three ODIs, and a T20I. While Bangladesh lost all their matches against South Africa except for an abandoned ODI, Shakib continued to build on the good bowling form he had found against New Zealand. On the first day of the opening Test, Shakib went wicketless; on the advice of Mohammad Salauddin, Bangladesh's assistant coach, he gave the ball flight on the second day and went on to take five wickets. He took another five-wicket haul in the second Test, again as Bangladesh lost to South Africa. Along with South Africa's Makhaya Ntini, Shakib was the series' leading wicket-taker with 11 at an average of 20.81. Shakib's performance against South Africa in a losing cause prompted former Australian leg spin bowler Kerry O'Keeffe to describe him as the "world's best finger spinner at the moment". Sri Lanka toured Bangladesh in December 2008 and January 2009 for two Tests and a Tri-nation tournament including Zimbabwe. Sri Lanka won both Tests and the tournament final, although Shakib turned in a man of the match performance, scoring 92 not out, in the second ODI against Sri Lanka helped Bangladesh to their only victory against them on the tour. In the first match of the Test series, Shakib took another five-wicket haul as his team again was defeated.
On 22 January 2009, Shakib was ranked first amongst ODI all-rounders by the ICC.


=== Captaincy and vice-captaincy (2009–2011) ===

At the beginning of 2009, there was speculation over Mohammad Ashraful and his position as captain after a succession of defeats for Bangladesh and continuous poor form for Ashraful. Shakib was considered a possible successor by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). However, the BCB was cautious of over-burdening the all-rounder and decided against the move. Other candidates were discounted, and Ashraful remained as captain. Later in 2009, Ashraful's captaincy was again under scrutiny after Bangladesh exited the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in the first round following losses to Ireland and India. When Mashrafe Mortaza replaced Mohammad Ashraful in June 2009, Shakib was appointed vice-captain, filling the position vacated by Mortaza.


==== West Indies ====
In July–August 2009, Bangladesh toured the West Indies. When Mortaza injured his knee in the first Test, he was unable to take to the field on the final day and Shakib took over as captain. He and Mahmudullah led Bangladesh's bowling attack, sharing 13 wickets in the match and securing a historic win for Bangladesh.
It was Bangladesh's first against the West Indies, their first overseas Test victory, and only their second Test win. The West Indies side was very inexperienced due to the fallout of a dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and the West Indies Players' Association over pay. The first XI had made themselves unavailable for selection and a new squad had to be chosen. Seven West Indies players made their Test debut in the match and the side was captained by Floyd Reifer who had played the last of his four Tests ten years earlier. Shakib was fined 10% of his match fee for excessive appealing; bowler Shahadat Hossain was also fined and batsman Imrul Kayes was reprimanded for the same reason.
In Mortaza's absence through injury, Shakib led Bangladesh for the remainder of the tour. Aged 22 years and 115 days at the start of the second Test, Shakib became Bangladesh's youngest captain and fifth youngest in the history of Test cricket. Under Shakib's leadership Bangladesh went on to win the second Test, and in the process secured their first overseas series win. Individually Shakib performed well, earning both the player-of-the-match and player-of-the-series awards, scoring 16 and 96 not out with the bat and taking 3/59 and 5/70 with the ball. He scored 159 runs in the series at an average of 53.00 and was Bangladesh's second highest run-scorer for the series; his haul of 13 wickets at an average of 18.76 from both matches meant Shakib was the equal highest wicket-taker for the series along with West Indies fast bowler Kemar Roach. After winning the Test series 2–0, Bangladesh proceeded to whitewash the ODI series, winning 3–0. The West Indies' dispute remained unsolved for the whole of Bangladesh's tour and the West Indies continued to field an inexperienced side. Shakib collected two half centuries in the ODI series, averaging 45.00, and was the third highest run-scorer in the series; he also took 2 wickets at an average of 48.00. For his performance in the ODIs, Shakib was named the man of the series. Brian Lara on his Facebook page quoted him becoming 'the man for all seasons' for Bangladesh after the conclusion of 1st ODI during the tour.


==== Zimbabwe ====
Shakib was appointed captain for Bangladesh's tour of Zimbabwe in August 2009 as Mortaza was still injured. In the second ODI of the five-match series in Zimbabwe in August 2009, Shakib scored 104 off only 64 balls before being run-out – his third ODI century – to help his team to their highest score in ODIs and lead Bangladesh to a 2–0 lead in the series. He finished the series with 170 runs from five matches at an average of 42.50 – fifth highest run-scorer – and 6 wickets an average of 39.66, fourth highest wicket-taker in the series. Following his team's 4–1 victory in the ODI series against Zimbabwe, Shakib travelled to Australia to undergo medical treatment for acute groin pain. He had been experiencing pain since the end of the West Indies tour, but he had decided to play through the pain and lead Bangladesh in Zimbabwe. Although he did not win, Shakib was nominated Cricketer of the Year and Test Player of the Year in the 2009 ICC Awards; he was the only Bangladesh player to be nominated in either category that year.
Shakib's success meant that it was not a given that Mortaza would replace him as captain once fit, but it was announced in September 2009 that Mortaza would return as captain for Bangladesh's home ODI series against Zimbabwe the following month and Shakib would return to the role of vice-captain. However, Mortaza failed to return from arthroscopic surgery on both knees in time for the series, and Shakib was again named captain. After losing the opening match – in which Shakib criticised the performance of Bangladesh's batsmen including himself – Bangladesh went on to win the series 4–1. In the second match of the series, Shakib passed 2,000 runs in ODIs.
On 5 November 2009, Shakib became no. 1 ODI bowler in ICC rankings.
In November 2009, Shakib was named The Wisden Cricketer's "Test Player of the Year".


==== England and the Asia Cup ====

Over February and March 2010 England toured Bangladesh for two Tests and three ODIs. England won all of their matches against Bangladesh. Shakib was Bangladesh's leading wicket-taker in both the Test and ODI series (9 in Tests and 5 in ODIs). Both Tests went to the final day and Shakib expressed the opinion that the experience had exhausted his side. The match was also a source of controversy after incorrect umpiring decisions on the third day went against Bangladesh, prompting Shakib to blame the lack of a referral system for some of the team's misfortune. In turn, Bangladesh toured England in May and July the same year. They again lost the Test series 2–0. Shakib finished as his team's leading wicket-taker with eight wickets, although he only scored 52 runs. Before the ODI series, Bangladesh left England for Sri Lanka, which was hosting the 2010 Asia Cup in June. Bangladesh lost all three of their matches. With five wickets, Shakib was Bangladesh's leading wicket-taker with Shafiul Islam (5 each).
As he was struggling to cope with the captaincy and his role as an all-rounder, Shakib gave up the captaincy in July 2010 to focus on his own performance. Mashrafe Mortaza returned to take charge in ODIs. Coach Jamie Siddons explained that "Shakib was the main person behind the decision, he decided it was a bit much for him. His form was down with the bat and he needed a rest." Bangladesh returned to England for the ODI half of their tour. Bangladesh lost the series 2–1, but their victory in the second match was the first time Bangladesh had beaten England in international cricket. While in Europe, Bangladesh were scheduled to play two ODIs against Ireland, and one each against Scotland and Netherlands. The match against Scotland was abandoned and Bangladesh lost one match to each of Ireland and the Netherlands.
For his performances in 2009, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC.


==== New Zealand and Zimbabwe ====
In October 2010, New Zealand went to Bangladesh for five ODIs. In the first match of the series Mortaza injured his ankle and was forced to leave the field; Shakib took over, and under his leadership, Bangladesh secured a nine-run victory, during which Shakib took four wickets and scored 58. Once it emerged that Mortaza would be unable to play in the rest of the series, Shakib was made captain for the remaining matches. In the fourth match, Shakib scored a century and took three wickets to help his team win by nine runs. Bangladesh went on to win the series 4–0, their first series victory against a full strength ICC Full Member nation. Shakib finished the series as the player with most runs and wickets on either side: 213 runs and 11 wickets.
Although Mortaza returned from injury in time for Zimbabwe's tour of Bangladesh in December, Shakib was retained as captain for the five-match ODI series. Following his side's defeat in the opening ODI, Shakib stated that he "was not prepared to take the job and I am also not satisfied with my role as a captain". Bangladesh went on to win the next three complete matches, with one called off due to rain, to beat Zimbabwe 3–1. Shakib was Bangladesh's second-highest run-scorer and wicket taker for the series with 156 runs, including two half centuries, and nine wickets.


==== 2011 World Cup ====
In February to April 2011, Bangladesh co-hosted the World Cup with India and Sri Lanka. West Indies dismissed Bangladesh for 58 runs, the team's lowest score in ODIs and a record low for a Full Member at the World Cup. Shakib described this match as the 'worst day' of his career. Shakib's house was stoned by angry fans in the aftermath, as was the West Indies team bus as it left the ground. Bangladesh registered wins against England, Ireland, and the Netherlands, but defeats by West Indies, India, and South Africa meant they did not progress beyond the first round of the tournament. With 8 wickets at an average of 27.87, Shakib was Bangladesh's leading wicket-taker in the tournament, and his 142 runs from 6 innings made him the team's third highest run-scorer.


=== After World Cup ===
Shortly after the World Cup, Australia toured Bangladesh for three ODIs. In the first match of the series, Shakib scored 51 to pass 3,000 runs in ODIs. Bangladesh lost the series 3–0, Shakib scored 69 runs in three matches and took just one wicket whilst conceding 117 runs. Shane Watson's performances in the series meant he was ranked first amongst ODI all-rounders, claiming the position from Shakib.
When Bangladesh toured Zimbabwe in August 2011 they were expected to win the one-off Test, which was Zimbabwe's first in five years, and the five-match ODI series. As it transpired Bangladesh lost the ODI series 3–2 and the Test. Shakib and his vice-captain Tamim Iqbal were sacked, with a BCB official citing unsatisfactory leadership.


=== Post-captaincy (2011–2017) ===
Bangladesh's first series under new leadership was against the West Indies in October 2011. Relieved of the captaincy, Shakib was Bangladesh's leading wicket-taker in both the ODI and Test series, his bowling was backed up by 168 runs in the two Tests (of the Bangladesh players, only Tamim Iqbal scored more), and 79 from two innings in the ODIs. Bangladesh lost both series. Following this, Shakib was Bangladesh's top run-scorer and wicket-taker in the home Test series against Pakistan in December 2011. In the second Test of the series, he became Bangladesh's first player to score a century (his highest score, 144) and take five wickets in an innings in the same Test. After the series he moved to first place in the ICC's ranking of Test all-rounders.
In the home series against West Indies in late 2012, he became the 2nd Bangladeshi to both take 100 Test wickets, making him the leading wicket-taker in Tests for Bangladesh, and to complete the 1000 run / 100 wicket double. However, he got ruled out of the ODI and T20 series due to a shin injury.
Shakib got ruled out of the Sri Lanka tour in March due to a calf muscle injury. He had a successful operation on the right leg at a private hospital in Sydney. He would be on rest for one month since his operation.
In 2nd Test match of Zimbabwe tour of Bangladesh 2014 Shakib became only the fourth player in Test history after Alan Davidson (1960), Ian Botham (1980) and Imran Khan (1983) to score a hundred and take 10 wickets in the same match.
On 7 December 2014, Shakib became no. 1 T20 all-rounder.
In 2015, Shakib helped Bangladesh to their most successful year in cricket. Following their success in the 2015 Cricket World Cup (where after batting in the first match at the 2015 Cricket World Cup, he had a total of 4,040 runs in ODI matches and became the first Bangladeshi cricketer to score 4,000 runs in ODIs), he also helped the team to a whitewash of Pakistan and series win against India and South Africa. On 12 June, he captured his 100th Test wicket at home on the third day of the one-off Test match against India. On 15 July, he took his 200th wicket of his ODI career by taking the wicket of Hashim Amla in the final ODI of the ODI series becoming the fastest, youngest and the only seventh cricketer to 4,000 runs and 200 wickets double in ODIs (in 156 matches).
On 26 September 2016, with the wicket of Shabir Noori during the first ODI against Afghanistan, Shakib became Bangladesh's leading wicket-taker in ODIs as well as in all formats at that time.
On 22 October 2016, with the wicket of Joe Root, Shakib became the first Bangladeshi to have bagged 150 Test scalps.


=== New era of Test & T20I captaincy (2017–2019) ===
After the retirement from T20I of Mashrafe Mortaza in 2017, Shakib was appointed as the T20I captain of the team for the second time. Later Mushfiqur Rahim was also removed from Test captaincy and Hasan was again appointed as Test captain. However, during 2017–18 Bangladesh Tri-Nation Series, he injured his finger and was rested for few days. In his absence, Mahmudullah captained the side in the Home series against Sri Lanka and 2018 Nidahas Trophy. His first tour was against Pakistan in July 2017.
On 28 August 2017, Al Hasan became the 4th bowler in Test history to record a 5-wicket haul against all Test Playing nations (except Afghanistan and Ireland, who were only granted Test status earlier that year) when he grabbed 5 wickets against Australia in his first encounter with the team. He also scored a half-century in the first innings. In the second innings, he only scored 8 runs with the bat, but he grabbed another 5 wickets to secure his first 10-wicket haul and the win. However, after the series, Al Hasan opted to take a break from Test to focus on limited-overs games.
In April 2018, he was one of ten cricketers to be awarded a central contract by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) ahead of the 2018 season. Later the same month, he was named in the Rest of the World XI squad for the one-off T20I against the West Indies, played at Lord's on 31 May 2018, but later withdrew from the squad due to personal reason.
In November 2018, in the series against the West Indies, he became the first bowler for Bangladesh to take 200 wickets in Tests. In the same match, he also became the fastest cricketer, in terms of matches, to score 3,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests, doing so in his 54th match.


=== 2019 Cricket World Cup ===
In April 2019, he was named as the vice-captain of Bangladesh's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In the first innings of Bangladesh's opening match in the World Cup, against South Africa, he and Mushfiqur Rahim scored 142 runs for the third wicket, the highest partnership for any wicket for Bangladesh in a World Cup match. Bangladesh went on to score their then highest total in an ODI match at that time, finishing on 330/6 from their 50 overs. In the second innings, he took the wicket of Aiden Markram as his 250th wicket in ODIs, to become the fastest cricketer to take 250 wickets and score 5,000 runs in ODIs, in terms of a number of matches (199). Bangladesh went on to win the match by 21 runs with Shakib named as player of the match. In that match he also became the first cricketer to score a fifty in the first match of Bangladesh in each World Cup since 2007.
In Bangladesh's next match in the tournament, against New Zealand, Shakib played in his 200th ODI. On 17 June 2019, in the match against the West Indies, Shakib became the second batsman for Bangladesh to score 6,000 runs in ODIs. For his unbeaten 124, he was awarded man of the match.
In the match against Australia, Shakib Al Hasan got out for 41 which was his first score of under fifty runs in this World Cup. He also missed out on becoming the first Bangladeshi player to score 6 consecutive 50+ scores in ODIs being now joint with Tamim Iqbal who had 5 50+ scores in 2012. In the second innings, Bangladesh went on to score their then highest total in an ODI match in a losing cause, finishing on 333/8 in 50 overs.
On 24 June 2019, in the match against Afghanistan, where he was again named man of the match, Shakib became the first batsman for Bangladesh to score 1,000 runs in the Cricket World Cup, and the first bowler for Bangladesh to take a five-wicket haul in a World Cup match.

== Disciplinary issues ==
In October 2010, Shakib was on 92 in the fourth ODI against New Zealand, when there was movement near the sightscreen, which the umpires failed to stop. After a few minutes Shakib, Bangladesh captain at the time, ran towards the sightscreen, hurled abuse and threatened to hit the offender with his bat. He was later warned by the match referee.
In March 2011, during the world cup match against West Indies, several people in the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium grandstand complained Shakib had reacted too strongly when he was booed. The offending picture was spread over the internet and published in several newspapers. Within days of that incident, Shakib blasted former national cricketers in his Prothom Alo column.
In February 2014, Shakib was fined ৳3 lakh (US$2,500) and was handed a three-ODI ban, because he had made an indecent gesture towards his crotch in the dressing room live on broadcast, during the second ODI against Sri Lanka. Shakib later made a public apology statement through his official Facebook page.
International ban: On 7 July 2014, Shakib was banned for eight months from all forms of cricket for what the Bangladesh Cricket Board described as a "severe attitude problem". Shakib missed Bangladesh's tour of the West Indies; he was also prohibited to participate in foreign tournaments until 31 December 2015. Controversy arose when Shakib left to play for the Barbados Tridents of the Caribbean Premier League, allegedly without informing board officials and without obtaining a No Objection Certificate from the board, a claim he has denied. Shakib found himself embroiled in further controversy after a dispute with coach Chandika Hathurusingha led to rumours of him threatening to retire from Test and One Day cricket. The BCB has ended the restriction on no-objection certificates being issued to Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, leaving him free to participate in overseas tournaments. BCB reduced his ban by three and a half months on 26 August 2014 letting him play for Bangladesh from 15 September 2014.
During the 6th T20I match which was a controversial tense clash between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as a part of the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, he argued the poor umpiring errors for not signalling a "no ball" delivery when Isuru Udana bowled 2 short pitched bouncer deliveries to Mustafizur Rahman in the last over of the match, where Bangladesh needed 12 runs to victory off the six balls. Fellow cricketer, Mahmudullah who was on the non-striker's end when Mustafizur Rahman was batting, demanded a no-ball delivery from the on-field umpires. Shakib later threatened to leave the field and recalled the batsmen from the field as a result of the umpiring errors. Reserve Bangladeshi cricketer, Nurul Hasan was also suspected to have breached the code of conduct for exchanging war of words with Sri Lankan skipper, Thisara Perera. It was also revealed that Shakib exchanged arguments with Sri Lankan commentator Russell Arnold. The International Cricket Council later imposed a 25 percent fine and issued a demerit point to both Shakib and Nurul Hasan for their unruly behaviour on the field by breaching the code of ethics.
Players strike: Shakib also led a players' strike which existed for a brief period of time from 21 October 2019 to 23 October 2019 demanding for higher salaries especially in domestic first class cricket system and issues related to proposal of Bangladesh Premier League to adopt the franchise method. He along with fellow players reportedly addressed the pay dispute issue to the media and even threatened to boycott the tour of India and the rest of international cricket season until their demands were to be fulfilled. However, the issue was sorted out as the BCB accepted to fulfill the demand of the players by offering salary increments. During the time when he was leading the players' strike, he was also accused for breaching the agreement with BCB by signing a sponsorship deal as an ambassador for an undisclosed amount with a leading telecommunication operator called Grameenphone which is also a former national team sponsor.
International ban: Shakib was initially selected to lead the team in the T20I and Test series against India, but on 29 October 2019, Shakib was suspended for one year and banned from all forms of cricket for two years by the International Cricket Council for breaching the ICC-Anti Corruption Code. Shakib was supposedly contacted by bookmakers while playing in the 2018 Bangladesh Tri-Nation Series and also in a group match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kings XI Punjab in the 2018 Indian Premier League. For failing to report those approaches made to him by the bookmakers, he was found guilty of breaching the ICC Anti-Corruption Code 2.4.4 and was handed a two-year ban, one year being suspended. He was able to resume international cricket as of 29 October 2020.
In June 2021, during the 40th group match between Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club of the 2021 Dhaka Premier League, Shakib kicked and broke the stumps after umpire Imran Parvez turned down a LBW appeal. He was bowling against Mushfiqur Rahim in the fifth over of the innings and kicked the stumps as soon as the umpire refused to concede to his appeal. In the same match, he also himself uprooted the stumps when the umpire halted the match due to rain in the following over. However, Shakib later made a public apology statement through his official Facebook page calling his behaviour as a "human error". Following the incident, Shakib was suspended for three matches of the tournament and was fined ৳5 lakh (US$4,100) by the BCB. The BCB also announced that a panel would be set up to investigate claims of biased umpiring in domestic cricket.
In March 2022, he was included in the Bangladesh squad for their Test and ODI Series against South Africa to be played in March–April 2022. But after the Afghanistan series, while leaving for vacation in Dubai, he stated in front of the media that he is not in a physical and mental state to play in South Africa, even he felt like "a passenger" during the recently concluded Afghanistan series. In reply, BCB President Nazmul Hassan Papon showed frustration for his selective match playing and questioned his commitment towards the national team. Later, he was given a break until 30 April 2022 from all forms of cricket. However, a day after, he was officially given rest by the board, he agreed to tour South Africa to play in both ODI and Test series.


== Controversies ==


=== Quota reform movement ===

Shakib's tenure as MP from the parliamentary seat of Magura-1, was cut short in August 2024, following the 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement and the Non-cooperation movement (2024). He was criticised by protesters and former Bangladesh Cricket Board member Mohammad Rafiqul Islam Khan for staying silent during the July massacre. Despite calls for him and other players perceived to be loyal to the Awami League government of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina to be excluded from the national team, the Yunus interim government allowed him to continue playing for Bangladesh.
A murder case was filed against him for ordering the killing of a garment worker, Rubel, during movement. Shakib later apologised for his silence throughout the protests and expressed his wish to be able to return to Bangladesh for his final Test match. In the end Shakib did not return to Bangladesh to play his final test match and decided to travel to the United States instead.
In April 2025, the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit seized all of his bank accounts.

However, there were insufficient funds in the bank account to cover the checks, resulting in the checks being dishonored. On December 15 2024, the bank authorities filed a case against Shakib and three others for check fraud. On January 19 2025, an arrest warrant was issued against Shakib for failing to appear in court in connection with the case. On March 24, 2025, the court ordered the seizure of Hasan's assets.


=== Birthday greeting to Sheikh Hasina ===
In September 2025, Shakib Al Hasan faced criticism after posting a birthday message for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who had fled the country following the 2024 mass uprising.
