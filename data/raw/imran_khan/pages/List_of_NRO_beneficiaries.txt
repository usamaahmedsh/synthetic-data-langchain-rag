The National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) was an ordinance issued by the former President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, on October 5, 2007. It granted amnesty to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats who were accused of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder, and terrorism between 1986 - 2007, the time between three states of martial law in Pakistan.  It was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Pakistan on 16 December 2009, throwing the country into a political crisis. All names were supposedly kept in secrecy but the government was forced to declassify all the names after a successful intervention by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
