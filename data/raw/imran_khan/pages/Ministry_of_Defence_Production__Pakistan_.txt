The Ministry of Defence Production (Urdu: وزارت دفاعی پيداوار; Trans.: Wazarat-e-Defai Padawar) abbreviated as MoDP, is an executive ministry of the federal Government of Pakistan with objectives of development and production of ordnance and machinery for the Pakistan Armed Forces.
Established as a separate ministry from its parent agency, Ministry of Defence in 2004, the MoDP oversees the development of conventional military weapons system through its separately funded organizations.


== Organizational structure ==
The Ministry of Defence Production is headed by Minister of Defence Production who is an elected member of parliament. The minister of defense production is assisted by the secretary of defense production—a usually a military officer. The MoDP is located in the vicinity of Ministry of Defense in Rawalpindi.

== History ==
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) established the "Directorate for General Supply and Development (DG&D) in 1947; it was reorganized as "Defense Purchase Directorate" in 1953.
After the war with India in 1965, the MoD took initiatives to increase domestic production of ordnance for the Pakistani military, and the "Defence Production Division" was established in 1972. Between 1970s–80, the assistance provided by China, France and Sweden, the MoD was able to established the Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT) for army, Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) for the air force, and expanded the work scope of the Karachi Shipyard & Engineering Works for the navy.
In a view of export control of weapon designs and ammunition's production in 2004, the Division was separated from the MoD and was established as "Ministry of Defence Production."
