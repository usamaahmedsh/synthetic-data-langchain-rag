On 21 January 2009, Boult was selected for the New Zealand squad for the one-day series against Australia at just 19 years of age. Boult only managed to play in the warm up game against the Prime Minister's XI and went wicketless off seven overs.

In 2012, Boult produced a string of strong performances with the ball against the West Indies, India and Sri Lanka to consolidate his position as Tim Southee's new ball partner. He carried this good form into 2013 when he took 19 wickets in 5 tests against England, including his best test match innings bowling figures of 6/68 at Eden Park in March.
After suffering a side strain during New Zealand's final test match against England at Leeds, Boult returned to the New Zealand test side for a two test tour of Bangladesh. Boult struggled in the hot and dry conditions, taking just 3 wickets and frequently straying with his accuracy. However, when back in home conditions against the touring West Indies, Boult swiftly returned to his best. In the second test at the Basin Reserve Boult won man of the match award, after taking career best figures of 10 for 80 and completing a brilliant one-handed diving catch to his left to dismiss Denesh Ramdin.  In the first innings of the second test on the same venue against India, Boult made another one-handed diving right-handed catch to dismiss Ajinkya Rahane.  He also had bowling figures of 4 for 146.

== Bowling and fielding style ==
Boult is a left-arm fast-medium swing bowler who makes up for his relative lack of height with deceptive pace of approximately 140 km/h and ability to swing the ball both ways with different variations. Boult's primary weapon is an inswinger to a right-handed batsman. Unsurprisingly, his childhood cricketing hero is Wasim Akram. In 2013, in a radio interview, the former New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney rated Boult as New Zealand's best bowling discovery since Shane Bond.  He is also known to haul in one-handed catches with either hand.  In 2014, he became the 4th test bowler since Richard Hadlee, Chris Martin and Iain O'Brien to claim 30+ wickets in consecutive years. He has developed a good opening bowling partnership with Tim Southee, having taken 46% of all wickets between them since 2013, especially since the retirement of Martin. In Tests, they are ably complemented by Neil Wagner's short left-arm seam deliveries. In August 2019, in the series against Sri Lanka, Boult became the third bowler for New Zealand to take 250 wickets in Test cricket.
