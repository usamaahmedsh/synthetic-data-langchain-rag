Bradley Edward McNamara (born 30 December 1965) is a former Australian cricketer who played for New South Wales during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Born in Sydney, McNamara was a right-handed bowling all-rounder, and played for the Australian national under-19 cricket team before playing for New South Wales. In 1999, at the end of his career, he also appeared in a single limited-overs match for the Middlesex Cricket Board.


== First-class career ==
McNamara was an all-rounder for the NSW Blues in Australian domestic cricket for over a decade.  When without injuries he was a regular selection for the Blues, particularly in one-day teams.
As a medium pace bowler, his strength was his ability to worry batsmen with a combination of accuracy and unpredictability. Off a relatively short run, he combined good line and length with difficult to read "change-up" balls, swing and seam.
McNamara was the "man of the match" in his first List A match for New South Wales.
While not noted for big hitting, his hard working and stubborn approach to batting made him a key member of many Blues tail-end partnerships. He still jointly holds the Blues first-class tenth wicket partnership record against Tasmania, an unbroken 138-run stand with Phil Alley. McNamara retired from interstate competition at the end of the 1999–2000 season.


== Channel Nine ==
After his retirement from cricket, McNamara went to work for Channel Nine, becoming their Executive Producer of cricket.
On 6 July 2016, it was announced that McNamara was leaving the network after 17 years. McNamara was quoted as saying "it’s time for him to do something else"


== Personal life ==
McNamara was best man at Australian captain Steve Waugh's wedding.  He played rhythm guitar, lead guitar and supplied backing vocals for Six & Out, a cricket-themed rock band composed of Blues teammates Gavin Robertson, Richard Chee Quee and Shane and Brett Lee.
