In 2003 Akram's then live-in girlfriend, Marijana Mihic, called the police to report him for alleged violent assault against her. Her report included charges of previous incidents of violence. While the New York Police Department did not arrest Akram owing to his diplomatic immunity, the case was pursued by the New York County District Attorney, Robert Morgenthau, with the backing of Majorie Tiven, sister of the then Mayor, Michael Bloomberg.
In February 2003, the District Attorney's office dropped the investigation after the Marijana Mihic retracted her allegations.
