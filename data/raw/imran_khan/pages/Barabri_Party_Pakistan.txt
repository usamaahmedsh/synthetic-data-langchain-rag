The Barabri Party Pakistan (Urdu: برابری پارٹی پاکستان abbr. BPP), a political party founded in 2017 by musician/singer, political activist, social worker and intellectual Jawad Ahmad. The party's name, Barabri, is an Urdu word meaning 'equality' because the fundamental underlying philosophy of the party is equitable distribution of resources and equality of access to opportunities for all citizens of Pakistan regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality or gender.
The party was delisted in January 2024 for failing to conduct intra-party elections.

The fundamental underlying ideology of the party is leftist. Equality of access over opportunities and resources for all citizens of Pakistan regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality or gender.


== General elections 2018 ==
BPP fielded 12 candidates for 5 Provincial and 7 National Assembly, including one woman, in 2018 elections, all of them belonging to the middle class, working class and youth, against the political stalwarts in the country. Jawad Ahmad himself challenged Imran Khan, Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal Zardari Bhutto representing the three major political parties in Pakistan, in 2018 elections. He believes that these parties represent the elites in the country and election is a form of business for these parties. Jawad Ahmad further elaborates that ninety-nine percent of Pakistan population belongs to the middle and working class and unless candidates representing this ninety-nine percent of the population enter the parliament to work on people-centric legislation, nothing will change and status quo will keep on existing.
The party did not win any seat and their deposits in all contested constituencies were forfeited.


== General elections 2024 ==
Ahead of the 2024 elections, the party was delisted by the Election Commission of Pakistan for failing to conduct intra-party elections and was not eligible to contest on any seat.
