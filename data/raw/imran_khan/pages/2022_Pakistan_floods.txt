From 15 June to October 2022, floods in Pakistan killed 1,739 people, and caused about US$40 billion in damage. The immediate causes of the floods were heavier than usual monsoon rains and melting glaciers that followed a severe heat wave, both of which are linked to climate change.
On 25 August 2022, Pakistan declared a state of emergency because of the flooding.
The flooding was the world's deadliest flood since the 2020 South Asian floods and described as the worst in the country's history. It was also recorded as one of the costliest natural disasters in world history.


== Background ==

The minister of climate change of Pakistan, Sherry Rehman, said that the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan had received more rainfall than the August average, with 784% and 500% more, respectively. Higher than average monsoon rains were also recorded in India and Bangladesh. The Indian Ocean is one of the fastest warming oceans in the world, warming by an average of 1 °C (1.8 °F) (while worldwide temperatures are now at 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) above pre-industrial temperatures, oceans in general are at around 0.7 °C (1.3 °F)). The rise in sea surface temperatures is believed to increase monsoon rainfall. In addition, southern Pakistan experienced back-to-back heat waves in May and June, which were record-setting and themselves made more likely by climate change. These created a strong thermal low that brought heavier rains than usual. The heatwaves also triggered glacial flooding in Gilgit-Baltistan.
Pakistan contributes less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but is one of the places most vulnerable to climate change. A study by an international team of climate scientists says that global heating made the flooding up to 50% worse and future floods more likely. However, some of the contributors to the severity of the flooding are local to the country. Deforestation in Pakistan has also been a factor worsening the floods.


== Impact ==

1,739 people died, including 647 children, and an additional 12,867 were injured. Over 2.1 million people were left homeless because of the floods. These are the deadliest floods in Pakistan since 2010, when nearly 2,000 died in flooding, and the deadliest in the world since the 2020 South Asian floods. On 29 August, Sherry Rehman, the minister of climate change, claimed that "one-third" of the country was underwater, and there was "no dry land to pump the water out", adding that it was a "crisis of unimaginable proportions". Her claim received widespread media coverage. In contrast, the UNOSAT United Nations Satellite Centre reported that 75,000km2 had been flooded (around 9% of Pakistan) with USAID stating a maximum floodwater extent of 32,800 square miles (around 10% of Pakistan). A BBC report estimated that around 10–12% of Pakistan was flooded; the total area of standing floodwaters peaked between July and August at approximately 32,800 square miles (84,952 km2). Agricultural fields were also devastated by the flooding.

The floods affected 33 million people in Pakistan and destroyed 897,014 houses and damaged another 1,391,467. 1,164,270 livestock have been killed, most of them in the province of Balochistan, while destruction to 13,115 kilometres (8,149 mi) of roads and 439 bridges has impeded access across flood-affected areas. Over 22,000 schools were damaged or destroyed.
The Ministry of Finance estimated the damage of the flooding was ₨3.91 trillion (US$14.9 billion), and the economic loss was ₨3.99 trillion (US$15.2 billion). The government required ₨4.26 trillion (US$16.3 billion) to recover from the flooding. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) also concurred with the damage and the economic loss assessed by the government of Pakistan. However, another assessment done by the World Bank and the Pakistan Climate Change Council claimed that the damage of the flooding stood at US$40 billion.
Aid workers warned that lack of clean drinking water caused an increase in waterborne diseases, namely diarrhea, cholera, dengue, and malaria. Skin infections caused by wet conditions have also been widely reported.


=== Sindh ===
Floods in Sindh killed 799 people and injured 8,422. Among the 338 children killed were three who died when the roof of their house collapsed in Kandhkot. 10 million people were displaced in Sindh and 57,496 houses were severely damaged or completely destroyed, mostly in the Hyderabad Division, and 830 cattle were killed. 6,200 km2 (1,540,000 acres) of farmland was impacted by the floods.

On 4 October, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has appealed to the international community to unite and assist Pakistan in coping with the extensive devastation caused by deadly floods resulting from unprecedented heavy rainfall. In a recorded message, he stated that the flood situation in Pakistan is truly a disaster that has brought immense devastation to the country.
Beyond the immediate response to the floods, the catastrophe that befell this low-income developing nation was an impetus for a global agreement on loss and damage for climate change, under which rich countries which caused the majority of carbon emissions heating the planet would compensate poor countries for the damage that has already occurred or which is unavoidable. Pakistani climate minister Sherry Rehman used this as an example of the damages that low-income nations face, which the New York Times described as "a fresh reminder of the destructive forces of climate change."


== Army helicopter crash ==
On 1 August 2022, a Pakistan Army Aviation helicopter on flood relief operations in the Lasbela area of Balochistan lost contact with air traffic control.
