== Reception ==
Khan has been criticized about his theory regarding the establishment of Darul Uloom Deoband. He was attributed with a statement mentioning that the establishment of Deoband seminary was done with support from the British India government and that the government had given a plot to the seminary's founder. Khan issued a clarification in his book stating that, "In any private conversation, there is a possibility of mistakes in the four stages: speaking, listening and understanding and then drawing conclusions from this conversation. If my discussion about the first construction of Darul Uloom Deoband gives an impression that the seminary received a favor of the British government, not only that I completely deny this impression, but those who have got hurt due to this impression; I seek forgiveness from them and from Allah Ta'ala as well. After this explanation, I hope that the scholars will not be mistaken."
Khan and his organization Al Nadwa Educational Trust have been sued in the State of Texas for Fraud. The suit seeks damages wherein Mufti Saeed thru, Madani Memorial Inc., a Michigan-based non-profit that has raised funds in the United States and wire transferred the same to Mufti Saeed are accused of fraudulently taking over $250,000 from YPS Foundation. The principals of each organization are also defendants in the complaint.
