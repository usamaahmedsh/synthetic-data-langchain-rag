Edward James Gregory (29 May 1839 – 22 April 1899) was an Australian cricketer who played in the first recognised Test in 1877 between Australia and England in Melbourne.
He came from a cricketing family, his brothers included Arthur, Dave, and Charles. His children were also notable, Syd, Louisa, and Charles Gregory, and his brother Charles' son was Jack Gregory.
Ned was also father-in-law of Harry Donnan. In the latter part of his life he was custodian of the Association ground at Sydney (later to be known as the Sydney Cricket Ground) after building the scoreboard there.
Ned Gregory and Nat Thomson are indicated by Wisden to have been born on the same day, and thus jointly were the earliest-born Australian Test cricketers.
