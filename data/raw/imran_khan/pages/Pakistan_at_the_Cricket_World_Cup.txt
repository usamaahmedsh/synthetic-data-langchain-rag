=== Super Six ===
Teams who qualified for the Super Six stage only played against the teams from the other group; results against the other teams from the same group were carried forward to this stage. As a result Pakistan carried forward 4 points from the group stage, with their wins against Australia and New Zealand. Results against the non-qualifying teams were therefore discarded at this point.
