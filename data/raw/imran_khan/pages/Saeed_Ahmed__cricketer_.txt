Saeed Ahmed (Urdu: سعید احمد; 1 October 1937 – 20 March 2024) was a Pakistani Test cricketer who captained the national team, and later became a preacher and member of Tablighi Jamaat. 
Born in 1937 at Jalandhar in what was then British Punjab, part of British India and educated at Government Islamia College in Lahore, Saeed's brother Younis Ahmed also played cricket for Pakistan.
A right-handed middle order batsman with a powerful drive who bowled off-breaks, Saeed made his Test début on 17 January 1958 against West Indies at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados. He made 65 in the second innings, at one stage partnering with Hanif Mohammad who went on to make 337. Saeed finished the series with 508 runs. 
Saeed captained his side in three drawn Tests in 1968–69 but his career ended in controversial circumstances when he declared himself unfit for the third Test against Australia in 1972 due to what he claimed was a back injury. In the previous Test, he had been involved in a heated altercation with Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee and the Pakistan management was sceptical about Saeed's injury. In all, Saeed played 41 Tests, scoring 2991 runs at 40.41 and taking 22 wickets at 36.45.
