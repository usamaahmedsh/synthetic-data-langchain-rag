Charles William Crosse (13 June 1854 – 28 May 1905) was an English sportsman who played international rugby union for England and first-class cricket.
Crosse was capped twice for England, first against Scotland in 1874 and the other against Ireland a year later, both times as a forward.
In 1875, Crosse played a first-class cricket match for Oxford University. A right handed top order batsman, he made just five and eight in the only two innings of his first-class career. He also represented Scotland at cricket, playing a match against Yorkshire in 1878. Previously, he had played cricket while at Rugby School before going up to Trinity College, Oxford.
