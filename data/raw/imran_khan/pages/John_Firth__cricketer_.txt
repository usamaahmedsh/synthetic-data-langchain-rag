He was born in Nottingham, the son of John Benjamin Firth and his wife Helena Gertrude.

A leg-break and googly bowler, Firth took all 10 wickets for 41 runs in a match against Eton College in 1917 and was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year among a selection of five public school bowlers in the 1918 almanack, there being no first-class cricket to report on.  In a first-class career of just four matches, Firth played twice for Oxford University and twice for Nottinghamshire.
