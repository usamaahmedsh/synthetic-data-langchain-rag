=== Resignation ===
On April 10, 2022, because of the regime change of Imran Khan's government, he resigned from the National Assembly on the orders of Imran Khan. The new government did not accept the resignations of many members for fear of deteriorating the number of members. However, accepting the resignations of eleven members on July 28, 2022, one of them was Akram Cheema. Later, by-elections were held again on his seat, Imran Khan made a surprising move to stand on his own in all the by-seats.
