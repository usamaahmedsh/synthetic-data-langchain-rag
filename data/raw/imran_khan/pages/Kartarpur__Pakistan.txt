Kartarpur (Punjabi / Urdu: کرتار پور; pronounced [kɐɾˈt̪äɾᵊ ˈpuːɾᵊ]) is a border town 102 km from Lahore in the Shakargarh Tehsil, Narowal District in Punjab, Pakistan. Located on the right bank of the Ravi River, it is said to have been founded by Guru Nanak, the first guru of Sikhism, who established the first Sikh commune there.


== Geography ==
Kartarpur is located at 32°5′13″N 75°1′0″E, at an average elevation of 155 metres (511 feet). It lies upon the western banks of the Ravi River, opposite the town of Dera Baba Nanak, a sacred town in Sikhism.


== History ==
The first guru of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, founded Kartarpur in 1504 AD on the right bank of the Ravi River with money donated by Karori, a wealthy Khatri convert. It was the site of the first Sikh commune. Guru Nanak settled there with his family. Following his death in 1539, Hindus and Muslims both said he was one of them, and raised mausoleums in his memory with a common wall between them. 


=== Partition ===
Prior to the 1947 partition of India, Kartarpur was part of Gurdaspur District of British Punjab, this district was subdivied into four tehsils Gurdaspur, Shakargarh, Pathankot and Batala. In 1947 this district (like the rest of Punjab) was divided between India and Pakistan. The Radcliffe Line awarded the Shakargarh Tehsil on the right bank of the Ravi river, including Kartarpur, to Pakistan, with Gurdaspur Tehsil (along with Pathankot and Batala) on the left bank of Ravi to India.


== Demography ==
The population is primarily Punjabi.


=== Sikhism ===
At the location Guru Nanak is believed to have died, the Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib was built. It is considered to be the second holiest site for the Sikh religion.
The changing course of the Ravi River eventually washed away the mausoleums. Guru Nanak's son saved the urn containing his ashes and reburied it on the left bank of the river, where a new habitation was formed, the Dera Baba Nanak. After Nanak's passing, the early Sikh community's headquarters was shifted from Kartarpur to the village of Khadur by his successor, Guru Angad.


== Transport ==
The town was connected by a historical railway station 'Darbar Sahib Kartarpur', linked by a branch line to Narowal Junction railway station. The line was closed back in 2000, leading to the deserting of the track and damage to the station building.


=== Kartarpur Corridor ===

On 9 November 2019, Prime Minister Imran Khan inaugurated the opening of a cross-border Kartarpur Corridor allowing Sikhs and all other Indians to visit Pakistan without a visa. On the same day, the first Jatha (batch) of over 500 Indian pilgrims visited the shrine thanking Prime Minister Khan for "respecting the sentiments of India" towards the shrine across the border that marks the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev.
