Later in the year Smith endured a disastrous tour of England. After a poor performance in the triangular ODI tournament (also involving New Zealand), where he averaged 4.20 with the bat and 56.33 with the ball, he was forced to return home after injuring his shoulder in the final Test.

After taking only two wickets and scoring eight runs over five matches played during the tournament, he was not included in the final against Australia.


=== Return to international cricket ===
