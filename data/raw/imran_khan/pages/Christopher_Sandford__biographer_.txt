== Life and career ==
Sandford was born in England, the son of Sefton Sandford, a senior British naval officer. He spent his childhood partly in the Soviet Union, where his father served as senior military attaché in the British Embassy, and partly in the United Kingdom. He was educated at Radley College and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he obtained a master's degree in history in 1977. He began his career as a journalist in London that same year.
Sandford lives in Seattle and London. Apart from his biographies, histories, novels and other books, he has written prolifically for newspapers and magazines in the US and the UK. His book The Final Innings: The Cricketers of Summer 1939 was joint winner of The Cricket Society/MCC Book of the Year award for 2020. Of The Final Innings, Alex Massie said in Wisden that "Sandford captures the shadows lengthening over cricket – and everything else – in late-1930s England."
