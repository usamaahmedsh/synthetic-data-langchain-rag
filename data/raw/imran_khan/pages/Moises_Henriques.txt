== Personal life ==

The son of former Portuguese professional footballer, Álvaro, Henriques was born in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, before moving to Australia with his family at the age of one. 
He graduated from Endeavour Sports High School in 2004, yet while attending high school he represented New South Wales and Australia at Under 17 and Under 19 level. In 2004 he was the recipient of the first Rexona Australian Youth Cricket Scholarship, an initiative backed by Ricky Ponting.

Henriques is currently dating Nine News presenter Sophie Walsh.


== Playing style ==
A genuine all-rounder, Henriques states that he "couldn't choose" between batting and bowling as his preferred art. Despite this, some have commented that his bowling is slightly better than his batting. As a right-handed batsman, Henriques bats in the middle to lower order, and as a right-arm medium-fast bowler he generally opens the attack. His style has been compared to Australian Shane Watson, but Henriques looks to South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis as a source of inspiration.
