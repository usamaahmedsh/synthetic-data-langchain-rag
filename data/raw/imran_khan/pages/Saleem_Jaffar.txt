== International career ==

== Test cricket ==
Saleem Jaffar was included in the squad for the Test match against West Indies at Faisalabad in 1986. In his first Test, Jaffar scored 9 runs and took 2 wickets for 57 runs. West Indies had earlier scored 240 runs. In the first innings, Jaffar got his first Test wicket by getting Richie Richardson caught by Asif Mujtaba for 43 runs while in the second innings, Jaffar got his second wicket in the match by dismissing Jeff Dujon. Against India in 1987 at Kolkata, he got two wickets for 148 runs, while in the Bangalore Test he could not get a wicket. In the Karachi Test against the England team that visited Pakistan in 1987, his five wickets cost 153 runs. In the Lahore Test against Australia in 1988, Jaffar took 3 wickets for 142 runs. His performance at Wellington against New Zealand in 1989 was remarkable. New Zealand's first innings score of 447 included Martin Crowe's 174 and Andrew Jones's 86. Jaffar got 3 wickets for 94 runs in the first innings and conceded 40 runs for 5 wickets in the second innings. In the second innings, his scalps included Andrew Jones for 39, Martin Crowe for a duck, Dipak Patel for 2, Jeff Crowe 23 and John Bracewell for a duck. He got four wickets in each of the two Tests against New Zealand in Lahore and Faisalabad in 1990. The Faisalabad Test against Sri Lanka in 1992 was his last Test where he got 3 wickets for 55 runs


== 18 runs in the 1987 World Cup ==
The last over of Pakistan's innings that Jaffar bowled in the 1987 World Cup semi-final against Australia cost 18 runs. Pakistan lost the match by the same margin of 18 runs. He played another 10 Tests and 15 ODIs for Pakistan after that, but his performance was not exceptional. The Faisalabad Test against Sri Lanka in 1992 proved to be his last Test. Jaffar's final over was of course not the only reason for Pakistan's defeat in the World Cup semi-final. There were other reasons as well, such as Dickie Bird's wrong dismissal of Imran Khan. Dickie Bird, Imran's favorite umpire, admitted his mistake and apologized to Imran. In this match, wicketkeeper Saleem Yousuf was injured when Abdul Qadir's ball hit him in the face and Miandad had to stand behind the wickets in his place.
