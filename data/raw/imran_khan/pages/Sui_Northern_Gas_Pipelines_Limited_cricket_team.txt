Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited cricket team is a first-class cricket team that plays in the Patron's Trophy. In May 2019, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan revamped the domestic cricket structure in Pakistan, excluding departmental teams in favour of regional sides, therefore ending the participation of the team. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was criticised in removing departmental sides, with players voicing their concern to revive the teams. The team was refounded in the 2023/24 season after a revamp of the domestic structure.
