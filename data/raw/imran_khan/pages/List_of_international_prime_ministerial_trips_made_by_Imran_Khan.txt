The following is a list of international prime ministerial trips made by Imran Khan during his term as the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 2018 to 2022.
During his tenure, his international trips were seven times cheaper than that of former President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari and former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif.
In January 2022, the total cost of Khans foreign trips since his 3 year tenure were Rs. 30 million (equivalent to Rs. 150 million or US$530,000 in 2021). The amount pales in comparison to Zardari's single visit to New York City in 2012 which cost $1.1 million and the $901,250 spent on Nawaz's single visit to the same city in 2016.


== Summary of international trips ==

As of April 2022, Imran Khan had made 34 foreign trips to 16 countries during his Prime Ministership from 18 August 2018 to 10 April 2022.
