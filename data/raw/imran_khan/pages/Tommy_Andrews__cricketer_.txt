Thomas James Edwin Andrews (26 August 1890 – 28 January 1970) was an Australian cricketer who played in 16 Tests from 1921 to 1926. At the end of Australia's tour of England in 1921, The Cricketer ranked him as the third best Australian batsman on that year's tour behind Warren Bardsley and Charlie Macartney.
Andrews was an attractive batsman who could bat anywhere in the order, a useful leg-spin bowler, and one of the great cover-point fieldsmen of his day. The Cricketer described him as "very strong and stockily built" with "the sort of hands that resist without discomfort the hardest hits and which, moreover, always seem to be in the right place to gather the ball." "Quickness of foot, clever anticipation and a beautiful return made by the flick of a wrist, are his in addition; and the complete result is a perfect fieldsman."
A regular player for New South Wales from 1912–13 to 1930–31, Andrews came to national attention when he scored 247 not out in 299 minutes against Victoria in the 1919–20 Sheffield Shield. He made his Test debut in the tour of England in 1921, scoring 92 opening the batting in the Third Test, and 94 at number four in the Fifth Test. He also toured England in 1926, when he was unsuccessful in the Tests but scored heavily in other matches.
After he retired from cricket, Andrews took over the family monumental masonry firm.
