=== Nevada House of Representatives ===
Nadeem ran for the Nevada General Assembly in 2024 to succeed Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod, who unsuccessfully ran for the Clark County Commission. Her Republican opponent, Brandon Davis, paid for billboards depicting Nadeem in a hijab— which she does not normally wear— and claimed she supported terrorist sympathizers over Facebook posts where she had supported Imran Khan. A website launched by Davis linked on the signs described Nadeem a "far left extremist" and utilized the hijab imagery, leading to condemnation by Nadeem, Assembly speaker Steve Yeager, and U.S. senator Catherine Cortez Masto as an Islamophobic attack.
Her election made her the first Muslim woman elected to the Nevada State Legislature.


== Personal life ==
Nadeem is Muslim and married to internal medicine doctor Nadeem Tariq, with whom she has five children.
