== History ==
The band's lead vocalist is Ali Aftab Saeed; Hashir Ibrahim, Daniyal Malik and Hamza Malik are also members of the band. The videos are directed by Farhan Adeel.
The band became popular when they released their first song "Aalu Anday", " an unsparing song that lampoons Pakistan's top politicians and generals from Ashfaq Kayani to Zia-ul-Haq, from Nawaz Sharif to Imran Khan"; After it became a hit song on YouTube and local video websites, mainstream Pakistani media started playing it as well in spite of its political content.
Beygairat Brigade released their second single Sab Paisay Ki Game Hai in February 2013. It criticised people's obsession with money and how it influences Pakistan's politics and safety issues. The song was extensively played in local media and immediately became a hit.
The Band's latest single "Dhinak Dhinak" released in May 2013 criticizing the Military's indirect domination of Pakistan politics was released and was promptly blocked on the video sharing site Vimeo, no reasons were cited. The lead singer, Ali Aftab Saeed, suspects that the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority blocked the video after a nod from the military.
