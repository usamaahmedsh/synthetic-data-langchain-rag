Thomas Garnier the Younger (15 April 1809 – 7 December 1863) was Dean of Lincoln from 1860 until his death in 1863.


== Life ==
Garnier was born on 15 April 1809, the second son of the Rev. Thomas Garnier the elder, Dean of Winchester Cathedral, and Mary Parry, daughter of Caleb Hillier Parry and sister of Arctic navigator Sir William Edward Parry. Garnier was born at his father's living of Bishopstoke, Hampshire. He was educated at Winchester School, and proceeded to Worcester College, Oxford. He graduated with a B.A. in 1830, and that year was elected, like his father before him, to a fellowship at All Souls' College, Oxford. At Oxford he was distinguished for excellence in all athletic sports, and he was one of the crew in the first university boat race. He took the degree of B.C.L. in 1833. In the same year he was ordained deacon; he was ordained priest the following year, both times by the Bishop of Oxford.
After having served the curacy of Old Alresford, Hampshire, he was appointed to the college living of Lewknor, Oxfordshire, and was in 1840 presented by the Earl of Leicester to the rectory of Longford, Derbyshire. Here he resided till 1849, when he was made chaplain of the House of Commons, holding with it the preachership of the London Lock Hospital. In 1850 Lord John Russell, then prime minister, nominated him to the important crown living of Holy Trinity, Marylebone, where he stayed until his resignation in 1859.
In 1859, on the death of Henry Erskine, Garnier was nominated by Lord Palmerston to the deanery of Ripon, from which he was transferred in 1860 to that of Lincoln. Shortly after his appointment to Lincoln he met with an accidental fall, from the effects of which he never recovered. He died at the deanery 7 December 1863 in his fifty-fourth year. He is buried in Lincoln Cathedral.

Garnier was the author of a pamphlet on the "New Poor-law Amendment Act", addressed to the labouring classes to disprove the supposed injurious effects of the proposed changes. He published in 1851 "Sermons on Domestic Duties", separate sermons and pamphlets.
