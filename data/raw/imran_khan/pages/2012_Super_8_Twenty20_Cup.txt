Final

Karachi Dolphins won the toss and elected to bat, and the decision seemed to have paid off when they powered past 60 in the Powerplay. Their batting was led by opener Khalid Latif, who carried his bat through the innings to finish with 81 off 59. The main support was provided by Shahzaib Hasan and Asad Shafiq, who scored 30 and 38, respectively. They made 167 for 8 in 20 overs. Raza Hasan's 4 wickets came for 33 runs.
Chasing 168, Sialkot Stallions lost Shakeel Ansar early but took control thereafter. Imran Nazir scored a rapid 41 (20 balls), before an unbroken stand of 119 at close to nine an over between Shoaib Malik (62) and Haris Sohail (55) sealed the game in the 19th over.
For the final, 20,000-odd people thronged the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, with its newly renovated stands. There were a further 15,000 fans outside the stadium, doing their best to catch glimpses of the action.
