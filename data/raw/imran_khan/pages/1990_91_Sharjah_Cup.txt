The 1990 Sharjah Cup was a cricket tournament held in Sharjah, UAE, between December 20–21, 1990.
Two national teams took part: Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Two other sides – India and West Indies – had been scheduled to take part, but withdrew due to the Gulf crisis.
Pakistan won the tournament on superior run-rate after each side won one match each. Pakistan won US$20,000 while Sri Lanka won US$10,000.
The tournament was sponsored by Instaphone.
