Allegations were made that Tarar threatened, intimidated, and harassed women and family members of Wasiq.


=== Controversy over middle finger gesture and apology in Punjab Assembly (2022) ===
In June 2022, he faced criticism on social media after a video of him went viral, wherein he was observed displaying the middle finger in the Punjab Assembly, while holding a copy of the Constitution. After facing criticism on social media for allegedly showing disrespect towards the Constitution and violating the decorum of the Assembly, Atta posted an "apology".


=== Issuance of legal notice over defamatory remarks (2022) ===
In 2022, Farah Khan, a friend of Bushra Bibi, issued a final legal notice to Tarar, asking him to stop making defamatory statements about her.


=== Criticism over acting as personal photographer during Iran visit (2024) ===
In May 2024, during Shehbaz Sharif's visit to Iran, Tarar, acted as his personal photographer upon landing at the airport, which prompted criticism from the public.


=== Allegations of violent crackdowns on PTI protestors (2024) ===
In November 2024, during the PTI  protest march towards Islamabad’s D Chowk, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Attaullah Tarar, publicly stated that military force could be used to prevent the march, which aimed to demand the release of Imran Khan. His remarks were later acknowledged by PMLN  figures, such as Mohsin Naqvi, suggesting their involvement in the response. 
Reports from the event indicated the use of military-grade weapons, including American-made sniper rifles and automatic guns, leading to claims of approximately 14 civilian fatalities, as well as the deaths of 4 military security personnel. In addition to these casualties, there were allegations of numerous abductions, with a list of over a hundred missing individuals compiled by various sources. The crackdown, which took place in the early hours, was accompanied by the shutdown of internet and mobile services, and reports indicated that lights at D Chowk were turned off during the operation. 
Government officials denied the use of live ammunition and maintained that order was restored, while PTI leaders condemned the response as excessive, describing it as a “massacre.”  There were also claims of efforts to cover up evidence during the night, with some suggesting that authorities took steps to suppress documentation of the events. The exact number of casualties remains disputed, with the government challenging PTI’s claims and calling for proof. 


=== Controversial remarks during the India-Pakistan crisis (2025) ===
On 7 May 2025, amid the India-Pakistan crisis, the Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Attaullah Tarar, while speaking at Pak-China Friendship Centre in Islamabad, claimed that India had conceded defeated by hoisting white flag at the Line of Control. Some media houses from Pakistan like Samaa TV even claimed that the white flag was hoisted at 'Chora Complex'. However, there was no digital footprint of any 'Chora Complex' along the border within India. This was described by Indian media as a "bizarre misinformation campaign." According to Indian media, there was no concrete evidence suggesting that the visuals came from the Line of Control and there were no international news reports on it either. The conflict pressed on until 10 May culminating in the 2025 India-Pakistan ceasefire agreement.
