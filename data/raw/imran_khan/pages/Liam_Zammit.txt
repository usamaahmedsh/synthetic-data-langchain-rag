Liam Aaron Zammit (born 27 January 1981) is a former Australian cricketer. He played three first-class cricket matches for New South Wales in the 2003–04 season, scoring 32 runs and taking 5 wickets.
Zammit has earlier represented New South Wales and Australia in the Under-17 and Under-19 competitions. Primarily a spin bowler specialising in the leg break googly, Zammit's fielding and lower-order batting subsequently gained him an all-rounder status.
