The son of Durell Durell senior, he was born at Westminster in May 1812. He was educated at Westminster School, before going up to New Inn Hall, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made his debut in first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Oxford University in 1838 at Oxford. In the same season he played for Oxford University in The University Match against Cambridge University, with Durrell making two further first-class appearances for Oxford in 1839 and 1840, both against the MCC. He scored a total of 108 runs in his four first-class matches, with a high score of 53 for Oxford University. After graduating from Oxford, Durrell took holy orders in the Church of England. He was the perpetual curate of Marchwood from 1860–78. He died at Winchester in June 1879, a year after leaving his ecclesiastical post at Marchwood.
