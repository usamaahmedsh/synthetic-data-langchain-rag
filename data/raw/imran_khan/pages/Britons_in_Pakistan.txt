Britons in Pakistan (Urdu: برطانوی باشندے) consist of British people and their descendants who emigrated from the United Kingdom. A sizeable number of Britons in Pakistan are British Pakistanis, descendants of Pakistani immigrants to the UK prior to their return. The city of Mirpur in Azad Kashmir has often been dubbed as 'Little Britain' due to the majority of British Pakistanis hailing from this region, and hence maintaining great settlement connections with the city.
In 2005, there were about 47,000 British expatriates in Pakistan, by 2015, the number had increased to 79,447.
