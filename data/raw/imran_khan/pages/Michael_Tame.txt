== Cricket career ==
Tame was an all rounder best known for his right-arm fast-medium bowling, who over a three-year career span took 16 first-class wickets at an average of 51.62. He won the TCA Medal for best Tasmanian Grade cricketer in the 1982–83 season. He made his first-class debut in a rain-affected Sheffield Shield match played at the TCA Ground in Hobart against South Australia on 20 December 1984. He took his first wicket in that match, dismissing Glenn Bishop for 88, to break a second wicket partnership that had been worth 126 runs.
He went on to represent Tasmania eight times at first-class level, with his best bowling return of 5/74 coming in his second match, played against New South Wales at the No. 1 Sports Ground, Newcastle. In a remarkable spell of bowling that would prove to be the highlight of his career, he achieved swing and pace to dismiss Greg Matthews, Imran Khan, Steve Waugh, Phil Marks and Bob Holland, four of whom were Test cricketers. He also played eight List A cricket matches for Tasmania, but never excelled in that format. He failed to recreate the form of that productive spell of bowling in Newcastle, and by the end of 1987 he had been dropped from the Tasmanian side.
Tame continues to be involved with Clarence District Cricket Club, with whom he won four TCA Premierships.
