On 29 April 2010 Pope Benedict XVI elevated the apostolic prefecture of Quetta, to the rank of Apostolic vicariate, with the same name and territorial configuration as before. He appointed Fr. Victor as apostolic vicar of the new ecclesiastical circumscription and the titular bishop of Timida.

== Current events ==
Heightened security following unrest in Balochistan has resulted in logistical problems for Gnanapragasam in 2019. His cathedral is in the same area as the army barracks and so he requires a special pass to travel to and fro. This is further exacerbated by frequent police/army checks. The prime minister of Pakistan Imran Khan has said that his government will look into “the plight of the oppressed and weakest segments of the society, including minorities.”


== Death ==
He died on December 12, 2020, because of a heart attack.
The funeral of Bishop Gnanapragasam took place at Holy Rosary Cathedral, Quetta on December 15, 2020. The funeral service was led by Cardinal Joseph Coutts accompanied by all the bishops of Pakistan. He was buried in the garden of the Cathedral.
On January 1, 2021, Pope Francis named Father Khalid Rehmat OFM (Cap.) of the Archdiocese of Lahore as the new vicar apostolic of Quetta.
