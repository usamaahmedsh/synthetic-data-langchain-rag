The Ormur (Pashto: اورمړ), also called Burki or Baraki (Pashto: برکي), are an Eastern Iranic people and Pashtun tribe mainly living in Baraki Barak, in the Logar province of Afghanistan and in Kaniguram, in the South Waziristan district of Pakistan.


== Background ==
The Pashtun warrior-poet Pir Roshan, born in 1525 in Jalandhar, India, belonged to the Ormur tribe. He moved with his family to their ancestral homeland of Kaniguram in Waziristan, from where he led the Roshani movement against the Mughal Empire.


== Language and demographics ==
Ormuri is the first language of the Ormurs living in Kaniguram and its vicinity in South Waziristan; today, all are bilingual in the local Pashto dialect of Waziristani (Maseedwola).
They are also found in Baraki Barak in Logar and in the outskirts of Ghazni in Afghanistan. However, Pashto and Dari have replaced Ormuri language there.
