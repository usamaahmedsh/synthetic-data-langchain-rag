Sherandaz Khan (born 7 March 1943) is a former cricketer who played first-class cricket in Pakistan from 1961 to 1977.
A distant cousin of Imran Khan, Sherandaz Khan was an all-rounder who opened the bowling and usually batted in the middle order. He made his first-class debut for Sargodha against Peshawar in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy in 1961-62. It was also Sargodha's first-class debut. Khan took 4 for 7 in Peshawar's first innings, and Sargodha won by an innings.
Khan continued to play for Sargodha, and was instrumental in their second first-class victory, which came in 1969-70 against Lahore A. In the first innings he dismissed Imran Khan, who was making his first-class debut, and went on to take 4 for 55 and 7 for 31 in the match, which Sargodha won by five wickets. In the final of the Punjab Tournament in 1975-76 he top-scored in each innings for Sargodha, scoring 78 and 36, but Lahore won easily.
