=== 2013 election ===
After he was marginalized by the leadership PPP, he announced to quit PPP in 2013 and joined Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). He said PPP was no longer the party of Benazir Bhutto and therefore he left it.
He was re-elected to the National Assembly as a candidate of MQM from Constituency NA-246 (Karachi-VIII) in Pakistani general election, 2013.

During a 2015 interview on Geo News, he disclosed of electoral rigging in his constituency, NA-246 (Karachi-VIII), from which he emerged victorious in the 2013 general elections.

Furthermore, he expressed surprise upon discovering that he had received 140,000 votes despite the reported low voter turnout.
In 2015, MQM demanded Gabol's resignation from the National Assembly seat. Following which, he quit MQM and relinquished his National Assembly seat. In 2016, Gabol declared his support for Imran Khan and announced to join the protest organized by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Afterward, he announced his intention to organize a public gathering to determine whether he should rejoin PPP or join the PTI.
In February 2017, he re-joined PPP. Opinions among residents of Lyari regarding Gabol's return to the PPP were divided, with some considering him irrelevant to Lyari's politics and holding him accountable for the presence of gangs in the area. PPP politicians in District South also expressed discontent, stating that the PPP leadership had not consulted them before readmitting Gabol into the party and emphasized his notoriety in Lyari. Additionally, there were rumors suggesting that Gabol was considering joining either the PTI or the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N). However, a faction within the PTI Sindh opposed his inclusion in the party, leading to his decision to rejoin the PPP.

== Lyari unrest ==
In August 2015, Dr. Jamil Ahmed, Deputy inspector general of police of Karachi's South district accused Gabol of attempting to instigate a law and order crisis in Lyari Town with the assistance of gangsters. In a press conference, he claimed that "Nabil Gabol had asked Ghaffar Zikri, one of the ringleaders of Lyari gang-war, to create disturbances in Lyari and that he (gangster) would be provided arms, ammunition and money for this purpose." PPP politicians from Lyari, including Provincial Minister of Sindh for Human Settlement (then Katchi Abadis) Javed Nagori, and Sindh Assembly member Saniya Naz, also accused Gabol of deploying armed individuals to the Lyari area with the intention of fomenting unrest.
His critics also accused Gabol of contributing to the rise of notorious gangs in Lyari. Gabol, however, denied the accusations. In January 2011, hundreds of protesters from Lyari staged a demonstration outside the Karachi Press Club, blaming Gabol and holding him responsible for patronizing gangsters in Lyari.


== Controversies ==
In August, 2018, he physically attacked an individual passenger at Karachi airport, which sparked widespread coverage in the media. Gabol also issued threats of severe repercussions against the individual. Gabol claimed that the person in question was persistently hurling profanities at Pakistani politicians.
In March 2020, police filed an attempted murder case against Gabol for purportedly assaulting and shooting at the residence of the chairman of the Fishermen’s Cooperative Society. The complainant alleged that Gabol forcefully took a firearm from the guard at the chairman's residence and issued death threats.
In April 2023, Gabol sparked outrage with misogynistic remarks, stating, "If rape is imminent, just enjoy it." In response, the PPP issued a show cause notice to Gabol.
