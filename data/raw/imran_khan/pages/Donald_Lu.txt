== Controversies ==

In April 2022, Pakistan's then prime minister Imran Khan claimed that prior to a no-confidence motion filed against him by opposition parties, Pakistan's ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed Khan, was warned by Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu that Khan's continuation in office would have repercussions for bilateral ties between the two nations. Although the State Department denied it, Khan reiterated the allegations against Lu during a televised news conference. During the Department Press Briefing on April 8, 2022, Deputy State Department Spokesperson Jalina Porter was also asked about the allegation by Khan that the US encouraged the no-confidence vote, with Khan stating that he had a cable ("letter") to prove it. Foreign Policy highlighted the heightened tensions between Pakistan and the US in their South Asia Brief on April 7, 2022. Pakistan's National Security Council (NSC) announced it was issuing a "strong demarche" to an undisclosed country, presumably the US, over a 'threat letter'—purportedly showing evidence of a foreign conspiracy to oust Khan's PTI-led government—terming it as "blatant interference in the internal affairs of Pakistan". Furthermore, Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general (DG) major-general Babar Iftikhar commented on the issuance of the demarche during a press conference on April 14, stating that "In this case, it was given for undiplomatic language and is equal to interference." Shireen Mazari, a Pakistani politician who served as the federal minister for human rights under the PTI government, quoted Donald Lu as saying: "If Prime Minister Imran Khan remains in office, then PM Imran Khan will be isolated from the United States and we will take the issue head on; but if the vote of no-confidence succeeds, all will be forgiven".
On 23 May 2022, Imran Khan suggested in an interview with CNN that Lu be fired "for bad manners and sheer arrogance."
On 9 August 2023, The Intercept, an online American nonprofit news organization, published what they claimed was a copy of the previously undisclosed cypher—a secret Pakistani cable document—dated March 7, 2022, attempting to demonstrate the alleged pressure from the U.S. State Department to remove then Prime Minister Imran Khan. The alleged cypher published by The Intercept showed both the carrots and the sticks that the  United States Department of State deployed in what PTI supporters claim was its push against Khan: promising warmer relations if Khan was removed, and isolation if he was not. 


== Awards and honors ==
Lu was awarded two Meritorious Honor Awards and five Superior Honor Awards.


== Personal life ==
Lu is married to Ariel Ahart, a public health specialist. They have two children. In addition to English, Lu speaks Chinese, West African Krio, Urdu, Hindi, Russian, Georgian, Azerbaijani and Albanian.
