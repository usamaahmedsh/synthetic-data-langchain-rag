Albert Atkins (26 March 1867 – 17 August 1943) was an Australian cricketer. He played twelve first-class matches for New South Wales and Queensland between 1895/96 and 1905/06.
Atkins was a middle-order batsman and excellent fieldsman in the outfield, praised in 1896 for his "brilliancy and cat-like dash". He captained Queensland on several occasions, including the closely fought match against New South Wales in Sydney in 1902-03 when he made his two highest scores, 82 and 60. He and his wife Emily had three children.
