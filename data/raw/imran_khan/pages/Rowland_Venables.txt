He scored 26 runs in his two matches, in addition to taking 4 wickets with his left-arm roundarm medium pace bowling, with best figures of 3 for 25.
A student of the Inner Temple, Venables was called to the bar in 1872. He was a member of the Oxford circuit and the chairman of the Ludlow Board of Guardians. He was also a justice of the peace for Shropshire and the Welsh county of Denbighshire.
He remained active in cricket following his time at Oxford and was a prominent figure in Shropshire cricket, appearing for the county between 1866 and 1876 while playing at club level for Oswestry, in addition to being a member of the Free Foresters Cricket Club. Venables died suddenly at Oswestry in March 1920.
