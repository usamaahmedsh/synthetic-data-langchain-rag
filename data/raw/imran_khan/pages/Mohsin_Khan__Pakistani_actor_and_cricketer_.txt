== Cricket career ==


=== International career ===
Playing as the opener for Pakistan against India at Lahore in 1982–83, he scored 101 not out of Pakistan's second-innings total of 135/1. This is the lowest team score in Test cricket to have included a century.
Mohsin was one of a minority of South Asian players to come to terms with conditions in Australia and England, scoring two consecutive centuries in Australia in 1983/84 and becoming the first Pakistani batsman to score a Test double century at Lord's, which he did earlier in 1982.
Sportswriter Shamya Dasgupta lists Mohsin among Pakistan’s most stylish batsmen, noting that he retired at 31 to pursue acting in India and highlighting his performance on the 1983–84 tour of Australia, where he scored 390 runs at 43.33 against a pace attack including Dennis Lillee, Geoff Lawson, Rodney Hogg and Carl Rackemann; Dasgupta argues that his height, technique against bounce, and elegance set him apart and that a longer career would have further benefited Pakistan.
Wisden ranked Mohsin and Mudassar Nazar ninth among the best opening partnerships, noting their 54 Test innings together at an average stand of 39.55 (1981–86). The piece characterizes Mudassar as technically orthodox and durable, and Mohsin as stylish and fluent, arguing that their steady accumulation, rather than expansive strokeplay, made them a dependable pairing that helped signal Pakistan’s future approach.


=== Cricket administration ===
On 2 March 2010, Mohsin Khan was named Iqbal Qasim's successor as chief selector of the Pakistan national cricket team. He accepted the role turned down by former Captain Saeed Anwar. Mohsin was Pakistan's fourth chief of selectors in the 12 months of 2009–10. He was appointed as interim coach of the Pakistan team on 3 October 2011 while the PCB formed a committee to search for a certified coach. Mohsin Khan was removed as interim coach once Dav Whatmore was selected as Pakistan's permanent coach in early 2012. Since being removed as interim coach, Mohsin Khan has applied for the coaching position on several occasions without any success. He is currently based in Karachi and can be seen on various private TV channels, continuously looking for a role with the PCB.
