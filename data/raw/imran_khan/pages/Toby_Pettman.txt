== Early life and career ==
Pettman was born in Kingston upon Thames in May 1998.  He was educated at Tonbridge School, before going up to Jesus College, Oxford to read classics, graduating in 2020 with a Double First.  While studying at Oxford, Pettman made four appearances in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Cambridge University in The University Matches of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, captaining the side in the 2020 game (the last to have first-class status).  In addition to playing for Oxford University, Pettman also made three first-class appearances for Oxford MCCU against Kent in 2018 and Middlesex and Hampshire in 2019.  In seven first-class matches, Pettman scored 122 runs at an average of 17.42 and a high score of 54 not out, while with his right-arm fast-medium bowling he took 33 wickets at a bowling average of 21.15, twice taking a five wicket haul.  He recorded his best figures of 5 for 19 in the University Match of 2019.
After leaving Oxford in 2020, Pettman was about to start a job in data analytics when he was offered a one-year professional cricket contract by Nottinghamshire coach Peter Moores. He played for the Nottinghamshire 2nd XI in 2021 and then signed another one-year contract for 2022. In November 2021, he was selected for a Marylebone Cricket Club squad to play a tournament in Almería, Spain.
Pettman began the 2022 season once again in the Nottinghamshire 2nd XI. In June 2022, he joined Derbyshire on a short-term loan. Making his County Championship debut against Middlesex at Queen's Park, Chesterfield, he took 3 wickets for 40 runs to record the best bowling figures in Derbyshire's first innings. Later in the month, he also played a single Championship game for Kent as a short-term loan signing to cover for injuries.
On 20 August 2022, Pettman made his List A debut for Nottinghamshire in a One-Day Cup match against Leicestershire, taking 1/45 off nine overs and scoring five not out. In his second game of the competition three days later, he took a career-best 4/44 against 
Surrey.
Pettman signed a new two-year contract with Nottinghamshire in October 2022. He announced his retirement from professional cricket in September 2024.
