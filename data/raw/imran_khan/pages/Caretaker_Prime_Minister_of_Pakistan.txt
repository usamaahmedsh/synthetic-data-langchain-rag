The caretaker prime minister of Pakistan (Urdu: نگران وزیر اعظم پاکستان) is the acting head of the Caretaker Government in Pakistan following the dissolution of the National Assembly. The purpose of this post is to ensure free and fair elections are held. The most recent Caretaker PM was Anwaar ul Haq Kakar, who took office on 14 August 2023, after the National Assembly was dissolved; he served until 4 March 2024.


== Federal law and constitution ==
Following the dissolution of the National Assembly, whether it is dissolved by the completion of its term or by an early dissolution, the President shall appoint a Caretaker government. However, this must be done with the consultation of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, who should reach a consensus on whom to choose as Caretaker PM. If this consensus is not reached, the President is free to choose a Caretaker Prime Minister of his choice, although this is usually done in consultation with the Election Commission of Pakistan.
