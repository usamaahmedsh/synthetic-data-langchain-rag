Adil Farooq Raja (عادل فاروق راجہ); born 5 December 1978), commonly known as Adil Raja, is a Pakistani former army officer who served as a major in the Pakistan Army until his retirement in 2022. Since relocating to the United Kingdom, he has gained prominence as a YouTuber and self-described whistleblower, criticising the Pakistani military establishment through online content. Raja has faced multiple legal challenges, including a 2023 court-martial in Pakistan for sedition and espionage, resulting in a 14-year prison sentence served in absentia, and ongoing defamation proceedings in the UK. In December 2025, the Pakistani government submitted an extradition request for him to British authorities.
Raja's online activities have focused on allegations of corruption, electoral interference, and human rights abuses within Pakistan's military and intelligence apparatus, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence. These claims have led to accusations of anti-state propaganda by Pakistani authorities, who have described his content as inciting mutiny among military personnel. His case has drawn international attention to issues of free speech, defamation lawfare, and the treatment of military dissidents in Pakistan.


== Early life and education ==
Raja was born on 5 December 1978 in Pakistan. He joined the Pakistan Military Academy and was commissioned into the Pakistan Army in 1998 as part of the 99th PMA Long Course.


== Military career ==
Raja served nearly two decades in the Pakistan Army, rising to the rank of major. During his tenure, he was associated with the ISI and held the position of spokesperson for the Pakistan Ex-Servicemen Society (PESS). He retired in 2022 amid growing public criticism of the military's role in politics.
Following his retirement, Raja established a land acquisition company that partnered with real estate entities, including the Defence Housing Authority. His military service ended amid reports of internal scrutiny over his public statements during the 2022 Pakistani constitutional crisis, including a house raid in April 2022.


== Activism and exile ==
In April 2022, Raja resigned from his PESS role and reportedly went missing in Islamabad before resurfacing in London, where he joined his family. From the UK, he began producing YouTube content under the channel "Soldier Speaks," positioning himself as a whistleblower exposing alleged military misconduct. His videos have accused senior officers of involvement in political manipulation and human rights violations, garnering a significant following among critics of the establishment.
Raja's activism aligned with supporters of former prime minister Imran Khan, particularly during protests following Khan's 2023 arrest. He has claimed threats to his family in Pakistan, attributing them to his disclosures. In 2025, Raja described a UK defamation case against him as an attempt by the ISI to weaponise libel laws for silencing dissent.


== Legal issues ==


=== Court-martial and sedition conviction ===
In 2023, Raja was charged under the Pakistan Army Act, 1952, the Official Secrets Act, 1923, the Pakistan Penal Code, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 for inciting sedition, defamation, espionage, and acts prejudicial to state interests. A Field General Court Martial convicted him in absentia on 7 and 9 October 2023, sentencing him to 14 years' rigorous imprisonment and forfeiting his military rank on 21 November 2023. Pakistani authorities alleged his content fomented rebellion, including during the May 9, 2023, protests that targeted military installations. Raja, residing abroad, has not served the sentence, and reports indicate efforts to seize his assets and cancel his national identity documents in Pakistan.


=== UK defamation cases ===
In August 2022, retired Brigadier Rashid Naseer filed a defamation suit against Raja in London's High Court over online allegations of corruption, electoral interference, judicial manipulation, and human rights abuses. The trial opened on 21 July 2025 at the Royal Courts of Justice, with Raja participating remotely due to safety concerns. Witnesses, including former accountability official Shahzad Akbar, testified on alleged election interference in Pakistan's 2024 general elections.
On 9 October 2025, Justice Richard Spearman ruled the allegations "false and baseless," ordering Raja to pay £50,000 in damages and £300,000 in legal costs. Earlier, in April 2025, the court had mandated £6,100 in interim costs. Naseer claimed Raja's statements led to death threats and privacy breaches against his family. Raja has appealed, framing the case as a "strategic lawsuit against public participation" (SLAPP).
In March 2023, a fake Metropolitan Police summons addressed to Raja circulated online, later debunked by Reuters as fabricated.


=== Extradition request ===
On 4 December 2025, Pakistan's interior minister Mohsin Naqvi submitted extradition documents for Raja to the UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, citing anti-state propaganda. The request accompanies similar proceedings for Shahzad Akbar and emphasises cooperation on illegal residents.
