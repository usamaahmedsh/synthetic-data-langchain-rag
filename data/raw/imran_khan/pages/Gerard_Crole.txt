== Biography ==


=== Early life and education ===
Crole was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, the only son of Gerard Lake Crole  (1855–1927), an advocate who served as Sheriff of Lothian and Peebles, and Elizabeth Ann (née Coats) (1857–1945). He was educated at Edinburgh Academy, and University College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1914.


=== Military service ===
Crole, having served in the Oxford Officers' Training Corps, was commissioned as a probationary second lieutenant in the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays) on 15 August 1914, but this was cancelled on 1 December, and he was then commissioned again on 4 January 1915 as a temporary second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery.
On 28 June 1916 he was transferred to the General List, and appointed an observer in the Royal Flying Corps, with the rank of temporary lieutenant from 1 July. On 27 April 1917 he was appointed a flying officer with seniority from 24 February 1916.
He was assigned to No. 40 Squadron to fly Nieuport Scouts. While operating between Douai and La Bassée on 25 June 1917 he shot down two Albatros D.V's within an hour (one shared with Lt. L. G. Blaxland). His third victory came on 2 July, and his fourth on 15 August, both D.V's, in the same area. His fifth and final victory, which made him an ace, came on 23 August, when he destroyed a DFW C near Lens. On 25 September 1917 he was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read:

Temporary Lieutenant Gerard Bruce Crole, General List and Royal Flying Corps.
For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in aerial fighting on many occasions. By his determination and fine offensive spirit in attacking hostile aircraft he has continually proved his superiority over the enemy, destroying several enemy machines and driving many others down out of control.
On 13 September 1917 he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain, and reassigned to No. 43 Squadron. On 22 November, his Sopwith Camel was shot down by Fritz Rumey. Initially listed as missing, he was later confirmed to be an unwounded prisoner of war, and spent the rest of the war at Holzminden camp in Germany.
After the armistice in November 1918, Crole was repatriated, and on 6 May 1919 he was finally removed from the RAF and placed on the Unemployed List. He then returned to Oxford University in October 1919 to further his studies, taking a diploma in anthropology.


=== Sporting career ===
As a student before the war Crole had joined the Oxford University Rugby Football Club, and gained a rugby Blue, playing three-quarter back against Cambridge in December 1913, in the last Varsity Match before the outbreak of hostilities. He also represented Oxford against Cambridge at golf in 1913 and 1914.

Post-war Crole continued in his sporting achievements, being selected to represent Scotland in the 1920 Five Nations Championship, playing in four matches between 1 January and 20 March 1920 and scoring three tries. In the first game against France at Parc des Princes on 1 January 1920 Crole scored the only try to win the game for Scotland. The game against Wales was played at Inverleith on 7 February 1920. Crole did not score, but again Scotland won the game. In the game against Ireland, again at Inverleith, on 28 February, Crole scored two tries, for a Scottish victory. In the final match of the tournament, against England at Twickenham on 20 March 1920, Crole was pitted against the English winger Cyril Lowe, like himself a former RFC flying ace.
