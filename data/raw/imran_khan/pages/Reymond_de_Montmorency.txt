De Montmorency was a right-handed batsman who bowled both leg breaks and right-arm slow-medium. He made his first-class debut playing for Oxford University Past and Present, a team composed of then current and former students, against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in 1897. De Montmorency batted once in the match, scoring 31 runs before being dismissed by Percy Clark.
De Montmorency made his debut for Hertfordshire in the 1898 Minor Counties Championship against Cambridgeshire, which was his only appearance for the county that season, while the following season he once more made a single appearance for Hertfordshire, against Buckinghamshire. It was in 1899 that he played his first first-class match for Oxford University Cricket Club, which came against Surrey. He played two further first-class matches for the University in 1899, against the Marylebone Cricket Club and Cambridge University. It was in the match against Cambridge University that he scored his only first-class half century, making 62 runs.

De Montmorency was a noted amateur golfer. He got his blue at Oxford in 1897, 1898 and 1899, being captain in 1898. He played for England in the 1908 England–Scotland Amateur Match and for the Amateurs in the 1911 Coronation Match and also represented the British team against the Americans at Hoylake in 1921, the match which led to the founding of the Walker Cup the following year.
